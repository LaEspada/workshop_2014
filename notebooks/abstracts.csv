0,"Following the theories of W. E. B. Du Bois on interracial contact and improving race relations, this study of two northern white missionaries to the United States South after the Civil War investigates the ways gender conceptions influenced interactions with southern African Americans. A close examination of the diaries and personal letters of Laura Towne, a missionary to the South Carolina Sea Islands, and Jacob Yoder, a missionary to Virginia, shows that certain types of contact more effectively altered the perceptions and feelings of the teachers than others, and gender ideologies played crucial roles in constructing the types of contact needed to transcend racial prejudice. Persistent contact, active and regular listening to the stories and experiences of freedpeople, encounters with African Americans of various classes, skill levels, and educational backgrounds, and common suffering and toil could lead some missionaries to reject white chauvinism and become part of African American society. It also contends that nineteenth-century gender conceptions, which positioned white and black women in the domestic realm of home and family, facilitated a high degree of inter-racial bonding for women that few men could have experienced. Ultimately, the accounts of Towne and Yoder are offered as templates or paradigms for further analysis and discussion of the importance of gender in missionary work and post-Civil War race relations."
0,"Immigrant citizenship rights in the nation-state reference both theories of cross-national convergence and the resilience of national political processes. This article investigates European countries' attribution of rights to immigrants: Have these rights become more inclusive and more similar across countries? Are they affected by EU membership, the role of the judiciary, the party in power, the size of the immigrant electorate, or pressure exerted by anti-immigrant parties? Original data on 10 European countries, 1980-2008, reveal no evidence for cross-national convergence. Rights tended to become more inclusive until 2002, but stagnated afterward. Electoral changes drive these trends: growth of the immigrant electorate led to expansion, but countermobilization by right-wing parties slowed or reversed liberalizations. These electoral mechanisms are in turn shaped by long-standing policy traditions, leading to strong path dependence and the reproduction of preexisting cross-national differences."
0,"In this study we examine whether and why human and social resources increase charitable giving. Using the Giving in The Netherlands Panel Study 2003, we find that people with more extended networks and higher education are more generous. However, these effects can be completely explained by financial resources, church attendance, requests for donations, and prosocial personality characteristics. People with more extended social networks are mainly more generous because they receive more solicitations for donations, and are more integrated in extended religious networks that promote charitable giving. The generosity of people with higher formal education can be explained by their larger financial resources, and stronger verbal abilities. Whereas the effect of education seems mainly causal, that of network extension appears largely spurious."
0,"There is evidence that females are less likely to cheat than males on college campuses. A frequently offered but still untested explanation is that females, with a stronger sense of responsibility for the maintenance of social relationships, tend to develop a stronger bond to a conventional societya key explanatory concept in Hirschis (1969) social control theory. With academic cheating as the dependent variable, we test the hypotheses that the four elements of social bond are the intervening variables linking gender to such dishonesty among Japanese students who, due to their stronger orientation toward masculinity on Hofstedes (1980) scale of gender role separation, are subject to more gender distinct socialization, leading to greater gender differences in the strength of social bond than those previously reported in the United States. The analysis provides rather limited support for the theory, most of which is due to the stronger belief in the legitimacy of societal rules among the females."
0,"This paper investigates the pattern of welfare recipiency (including TANF, food stamp, and Medicaid benefits) among low-income immigrant families in economic weak and strong times since implementation of welfare reform.   We analyze change over time for the family within a longitudinal framework using data from the 12 waves of the 1996-1999 Panel  and 9 waves of the 2001-2003 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).  SIPP data detailing migration, employment, and public assistance recipiency histories permit comparison by immigrant type (legal permanent resident or naturalized citizen).  These data are merged with state-level indicators of immigrant-specific welfare policy.  State-policy data were created for each year post welfare reform by quantifying textual information from the Urban Institutes Welfare Rules Database (WRD).  Compared with past research that relies primarily on period-based changes from one cohort to another over this time, we follow a prospective modeling approach to ask:  What have immigrant families experienced with regard to transitions to and from public assistance and how do these experiences differ by economic context?  What part do state policies and employment of family members play in these trajectories? And how do these experiences compare with those of poor families among the native born population for these two time periods?  Fluctuating employment opportunities combine with state-to-state variation in state welfare policy rules regarding immigrant eligibility in our analysis are expected to have significant impacts on immigrant family transitions to and from public assistance."
0,"Conventional social mobility research, which measures family social class background relative to only fathers' characteristics, presents an outmoded picture of families-a picture wherein mothers' economic participation is neither common nor important. This article demonstrates that such measurement is theoretically and empirically untenable. Models that incorporate both mothers' and fathers' characteristics into class origin measures fit observed mobility patterns better than do conventional models, and for both men and women. Furthermore, in contrast to the current consensus that conventional measurement strategies do not alter substantive research conclusions, analyses of cohort change in social mobility illustrate the distortions that conventional practice can produce in stratification research findings. By failing to measure the impact of mothers' class, the current practice misses a recent upturn in the importance of family background for class outcomes among men in the United States. The conventional approach suggests no change between cohorts, but updated analyses reveal that inequality of opportunity increased significantly for men born since the mid-1960s compared with those born earlier in the century."
0,"Given that the debates about a financialisation of life in Anglo-American countries are possibly premature, this paper explores the potential emotion-rules and time-orientations in financial organisations. It is a work in progress for new research which queries the extent that Anglo-American financial rules have been imposed on other financial capitals of the world, eg Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore/KL or Mumbai. Debates on emotion-rules (eg Flam, Barbalet and obviously Hoschchild and Goffman) are mentioned in passing, so too the relation between culture and emotions in economy (eg Berezin). The paper explores the specific time-orientations in Anglo-American finance organisations (theoretically extremely interesting, given the prominence of utopian orientations to time in Mannheim and in contemporary physics, cf. orthodox economics or sociology for that matter) and draws on a certainty construction typology (Zinn) which is stretched and modified, to investigate qualitative interview material with informed sceptics in the financial world."
0,"Previous research has identified a positive relationship between prisoner reentry and crime rates. The relationship potentially reflects both the recidivism of reentering offenders and the broader impact of the releases on the social organization of the areas to which they return. This article explores how economic conditions moderate the association between the size of the reentering population and crime rates. Using a state-level panel spanning the years 1978 through 2003, and two alternative measures of economic strength, the results demonstrate that the amount of increase in property and violent crime associated with prisoner societal reentry is substantially lessened by strong economic conditions. The findings suggest that economic conditions and criminal justice policies should not be pitted against each other as simply competing explanations for variation in crime rates. Instead, they should be recognized as irreducibly interdependent. Keywords: mass incarceration, prisoner reentry, crime rate, unemployment, economic conditions."
0,"This study tests the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis by examining the age-varying relationships between education, health risks, and disease onset and survival duration. Results based on 20 years of longitudinal data suggest that education is related to both the individual and accumulated number of behavioral, social, and economic health-risks, which in turn, are related to increasing educational differences in rates of disease incidence and survival. For hypertension, behavioral risks fully account for education's negative effect on disease onset whereas educational differences in survival are best explained by the accumulation of social and economic risks. For heart attack, a combination of behavioral, social, and economic risks mediate the association between education and incidence, but neither the individual nor accumulated health-risks could account for education's positive effect on surviving after a heart attack. Similar findings for diabetes and stroke are also discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"While much work has been done on the emerging adulthood stage of life, sexual minorities have been neglected from this body of literature.  This work examines what life looks like during the early adult years of sexual-minorities.  Specifically, this work looks at the differences between sexual-minority and heterosexual young people with respect to union formation and nest leaving.  This paper uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)  to look at nest leaving and union formation among sexual-minority young people to see if such behaviors differ from their heterosexual counterparts.  We believe this research is important since it could inform the understanding of the emerging adulthood transition for sexual-minority young people and also help form a foundation for future research exploring development and outcomes among this population.  General findings indicate that nest-leaving and union formation behaviors differ between heterosexual and sexual-minority individuals.  Specifically, bisexuals have greater odds of having left the parental home and forming a union.  Further, when compared to heterosexuals, gays and lesbians have greater odds of having left the nest but are no more likely to have formed a union."
0,"When policy issues involve complex technical questions, demonstrations are more likely to marshal charts, graphs, models, and simulations than to mobilize popular movements in the streets.  In this paper we analyze PowerPoint demonstrations, the most ubiquitous form of digital demonstrations.  Our first set of demonstrations are the PowerPoint representations made in December 2002 by the seven finalist architectural teams in the Innovative Design competition for rebuilding the World Trade Center.  Our second case occurred some blocks away, several months later: Colin Powells PowerPoint demonstration at the United Nations.  We argue that Edward Tuftes denunciation of PowerPoint does not capture the cognitive style made possible by the affordances of this pervasive new technology  and that our cases do not fit into Harry Collinss distinction between experiments, demonstrations, and epidictic displays of virtuosity.   We develop new concepts to highlight the spatial and temporal properties of digital forms of persuasion."

0,"Market models of school choice predict that allowing parents and students to choose schools will increase achievement by increasing competition between schools, forcing them organize more effectively in order to retain a clientele of students (Chubb & Moe 1990).  Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, I test the market model of school choice.  The results provide little support for market claims.  Public schools of choice appear to be no more organized than regular public schools.  Moreover, although Catholic and non-Catholic private schools have higher school organization scores, greater achievement gains in these schools are not mediated by school organization. These findings have important implications for market-based reforms in education."
0,"This article examines the influence of resource dependence and institutional processes on post-Civil Rights Act changes in private sector workplace segregation. We use data collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1966 through 2000 to examine organizations embedded within their firm, industry, local labor market and federal regulatory environments. Sex segregation declines precipitously from 1966 through 2000, but we see little evidence that organizations in the same industrial environment have established a stable pattern of segregation and integration. In other words, sex segregation has not been institutionalized. Race segregation, on the other hand, shows strong and increasing evidence of institutionalization, but weak declines after 1980. Firm visibility, field concentration and federal contractor density, but not direct federal affirmative action reporting, prove to be particularly important for understanding changes in segregation levels and institutionalization within industries. Results point to the importance of organizational fields and labor queues for motivating both persistence and change in workplace inequality."
0,"This paper examines the understudied relationship between gender and heterosexual sexual activity in midlife.  We use multinomial logistic regression to analyze data from 1,240 women and men, aged 40 to 59, who participated in the National Health and Social Life Survey.  Despite similar numbers of sexual partners per year in early middle age, after age 50, women report fewer partners--more often no partners--than men.  Age, sexual conservatism, and not cohabiting all predict lower levels of sexual activity for both genders.  The negative effects of age begin at earlier ages for women than men, suggesting that ageism and sexism combine to women's disadvantage."
0,"Students at a mid-size state university in the Southeast were surveyed to examine religion, race, social class, and gender differences in dating and hooking up. Our analyses revealed that dating and hooking up coexist on campus and most students defined hooking up as a sexual encounter. Race impacted dating but the other demographics, social class and gender were not significant for either dating or hooking up. Conservative Protestants hooked up less than Catholics and other Protestants. Seniors have dated and hooked up more than other students, especially freshmen. How students define hooking up impacts their probability of hooking up and their feelings after hooking up also have an effect."
0,"Researchers have found that religious participation is correlated with marital satisfaction. Less is known about whether religion also benefits participants in nonmarital, intimate relationships or whether religious effects on relationships vary by gender. Using data from the first three waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we find that religious participation by fathers, irrespective of marital status, is consistently associated with better relationships among new parents in urban America; however, mothers' participation is not related to relationship quality. These results suggest that religious effects vary more by gender than by marital status. We conclude that mend investments in relationships appear to depend more on the institutional contexts of those relationships, such as participation informal religion."
0,"Opportunities for economic mobility and employment stability are strongly associated with a college degree.  Consequently, postsecondary education research has paid close attention to high attrition rates across colleges.  In particular, the impact of “social integration,” or social connectedness, on retention has been a topic of much discussion.  While there is general support for social integration increasing student achievement and commitment to college completion, the field has found mixed evidence across various types of students and institutions.  One source of disagreement in the findings to-date is the process by which students achieve integration, defined as a “rites of passage” model.  This paper tests the applicability of the rites of passage model through a qualitative analysis of the social capital of new community college students.  Ultimately, our findings contest the first step of the model, that students must break ties with non-college communities to achieve integration. Our data suggest that the assumption that separation must occur before transition to college and incorporation of college norms and values oversimplifies the range of students’ non-college ties. While other aspects of the model hold true in our analysis, we present a revision to account for the positive role of non-college ties in social integration."
0,"This study assesses whether political arrangements across the US states influenced spending on childrens health insurance programs (CHIP).  CHIP is the most significant expansion of the US welfare state since the enactment of Medicaid in 1965.  We derive hypotheses from theories of political partisanship, policy legacies, and institutionalist approaches.  Random effects panel models that span 1998-2005 show that political partisanship theory is supported.  Institutional arguments are partially supported.  And policy legacies also contribute to the generosity of CHIP.  The most important finding is the role that partisan politics plays in the provision of social services to children.  The implications are discussed."
0,"African American and Latino young gay and bisexual men are at particularly high risk of HIV infection. Substance use is highly correlated with unprotected anal sex, a primary risk factor for HIV acquisition among young gay and bisexual men. While few studies have focused specifically on substance use and sex among young African American or Latino gay and bisexual men, recent research has identified differences in substance use patterns compared to young White gay and bisexual men. We attempt to contextualize such differences using West and Fenstermaker’s (1995) conceptualization of how individuals accomplish gender, racial, and class identity in everyday life.  Our study uses data from 30 qualitative interviews with young African American and Latino gay and bisexual men to contextualize these different patterns of substance use, paying close attention to the social milieu in which substance use during sex takes place for these men. In particular, we show that how our participants use sex drugs and which sex drugs they use are products of how they navigate and perform their social identities as young African American and Latino gay and bisexual men.  Additionally, we delineate key implications for service providers: most crucially, the value of addressing young men’s assumptions about substance use norms within their communities and acknowledging the role of social identities and communities in structuring substance use and sexual risk among young African American and Latino gay and bisexual men."
0,"Little is known about how influence flows in the academy, because of inherent difficulties in collecting data on large samples of friendship and advice-seeking networks over time. We propose taking advantage of the relative abundance of ""affiliation network"" data to assess aggregate patterns of how individual and dyadic characteristics channel influence among researchers. We formulate and test our approach using new data on 2034 faculty members at Stanford University over a 15-year period, analyzing different affiliations as potential influence channels for changes in grant productivity. Results indicate that research productivity is more malleable to ongoing interpersonal influence processes than suggested in prior research: a strong, salient tie to a colleague in an authority position is most likely to transmit influence, and most forms of influence are likely to spill over to behaviors outside those jointly produced by collaborators. However, the genders and institutional locations of ego-alter pairs significantly affect how influence flows. "
0,"The objective of this paper is to analyze middle class citizens trust in political and economic actors in Argentina, their satisfaction with the performance of Argentine democracy, and the relationship between these two variables. Our study brings new elements to the discussion about this relationship by incorporating a novel and more holistic way of measuring these variables. Our hypothesis is that the higher the levels of trust, the higher the levels of satisfaction with democracy. Our control variables are the respondents socio-demographic characteristics and their political/social activism. Data come from a random sample of 400 Buenos Aires middle-class residents during October and November 2002. Our major analytic techniques are cross-tabulation and regression. Our findings suggest that the interviewees highly distrust the political and economic elites, and that the level of satisfaction with the performance of the Argentine democracy is alarmingly low, especially in relation to the social role of the state, and the rule of the legal system. In addition, trust is the most important significant explanatory variable of satisfaction, and among different types of trust, organizational trust in big companies, banks and police forces is the one with best explanatory power, followed by trust in politicians, judges/prosecutors, trade union leaders and religious ministers."
0,"As Latino workers increasingly migrate to Japan, their children are attending Japanese public schools in growing numbers. This paper examines Japanese teachers efforts to socialize these Latino parents and children into the Japanese public school setting. Drawing on interviews and participant observation in an elementary school with a growing number of Latino students, this analysis conceptualizes some teachers actions as those of ethnic boundary enforcers who frame violations of school customs as caused by foreign parents resistance to Japanese norms. This framing strengthens the ethnic boundary between Japanese teachers and Latino parents by defining the category of foreign as potentially deviant and in contrast to the positively framed, normative category of Japanese. This analysis also explores the connection between these frames of the issues and teachers professional interests, including the use of their role as custodians of the children to justify their critiques of the parents. Negative stereotypes of Latinos also legitimize teachers actions by framing teachers as benefactors and the parents as low-status, migrant factory workers in need of help to overcome the difficult task of living in Japan."
0,"Violence is a prevalent and persistent problem in many urban school systems. However, to date, there is very little sociological research that attempts to understand the academic consequences of exposure to that violence. The minimal evidence that currently exists relies largely on an individualistic, psychological model in which children who are exposed to violence suffer from a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome and are therefore more likely to act out in school or have trouble concentrating on their learning material. In this paper, I use evidence from urban sociology and the sociology of education to propose a new model that focuses on the social consequences of violence and its effects on achievement through its potential to undermine students’ emotional, behavioral, and cognitive engagement in the learning process. I then test how well that theory fits data from the Chicago Police Department and public schools.  I find that the overall model fits the data very well and that the majority of the association between violent incidents, engagement, and achievement is explained by subjective reports of safety.  Furthermore, after controlling for safety and engagement, violent incidents have a small, but significant positive association with test scores."
0,"How do financial institutions shape labor process practice? Labor process studies ignore finance, while organizational theory accounts of finance focus upon corporate control but do not extend the analysis into the labor process. This ethnographic study of a Silicon Valley startup during the late dot-com bubble seeks to fill this gap. During the bubble, the financial community demanded a plausible potential for future profitability in startups before it would embrace an IPO. In the startup, rival departments offered competed visions of what role production should play in establishing an appearance of potential future profitabilility.Software developers emerged victorious in this struggle, framing a methodical, rigidly regulated process that reflected operational discipline as the best way to demonstrate the startup’s superiority to irresponsibly run dot-coms. Practice was characterized by rules that made managing technical risk the collective responsibility of the entire company and which gave developers the political means to resist work deemed too risky. The bursting of the dot-com bubble set off a struggle by executive management to break the developers’ control over production, eventually resulting in a new, deregulated logic of practice in which the responsibility for managing risk devolved onto individual developers."

This paper asserts his assertion and considers several key questions: What is visual culture?  How is it important for ethnography? What are the appropriate tools that ethnographers should use to incorporate these new elements of human experience into the ethnographic text? This paper approaches these questions by examining the role of art as a medium for understanding larger social processes ethnographically.  By exploring key ethnographies, the work begins to answer these questions within the context of visual culture in the arts."
0,"Compared to other ethnic and racial groups, Hispanic youth are worse off in every available measure of educational achievement and attainment at the primary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Using data from the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project, we explore the degree to which students' preferences to stay home for college can help explain the low college application rates of Hispanic students. Among high school seniors, we find that (1) Hispanics are the most likely to report it is important to live at home during college, even those with college-educated parents; (2) net of other factors, students who indicate it is important to stay home are significantly less likely to apply to college, especially to selective institutions; and (3) taking account of the preference to stay home significantly reduces the Hispanic-white gap in applying to any college and a four-year college, and it makes the gap in applying to a selective college disappear."
0,"The death penalty abolition has become to be worldwide social phenomenon these days. This article aims to explain why this phenomenon has diffused rapidly through the world. According to traditional perspectives which stress a peculiarity each society is embedded in, abolition of the death penalty is ascribed to domestic factors such as changes in individual personalities and difference in religion. But We suggest these perspectives cant account for worldwide rapid diffusion of the death penalty abolition. We assume that not any states that abolished the death penalty have same domestic factors. Rather it may be the reason why states abolished the death penalty that states would like to acquire the legitimacy from inner and outer society. This explanation is based on world culture perspective(neo-institutional perspective) which highlights nation-states, isomorphism, and world society. We assert worldwide abolition of the death penalty is not a victory of justice, but an isomorphic phenomenon, and We argue that states abolished the death penalty to acquire high evaluation in the respect of human rights. We show world culture perspective can be applied to not only establishment of the institution but also dissolution of the institution."
0,"This article investigates how social network use to find work affects pay. Analyses using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality consider the extent to which a network contact's influence level affects a job applicant's pay, whether this effect differs for white, black, and Latino contacts, and how workplace racial context moderates this relationship. Three main findings emerge. First, having an influential contact-one with hiring authority-compared to having no contact yields higher pay. Second, white and minority contact influence on pay differs: among minority contacts, being an outsider (i.e., someone not employed by the firm to which the applicant applies) is associated with higher pay, but being an employee of the firm-an insider-is not. Third, regardless of workplace racial context. black and Latino contacts' influence is most beneficial when their race/ethnicity is not known to the hiring agent. We offer a new interpretation of the mixed findings with regard to the relationship between social network use and pay. "
0,"Increased remittances resulting from increased migration are clearly associated with producing short-run positive effects at the individual and local levels but, conversely, are said to cause longer-term, detrimental effects on a developing countrys overall economy.  These arguments present overly pessimistic views on the role remittances play in developing countries, and instead, argue for liberalized trade policies and opening markets to achieve growth and development.  Most empirical research focusing on remittances as a development tool explores migrant motivations for remitting and the short-term micro-effects they may have on individuals, households, and local economies, but fail to consider the longer-run effects on economic growth and development for developing countries.  This paper explores the current conjecture over remittances role in economic growth and development and the relationship between remittances and other, yet untested economic measures, proposing these better reflect the impact remittances have on developing countries' overall economies.  The findings of this work conclude there significant correlations between these economic variables and remittances; which, imply long- term economic growth is occurring as remittances increase within the developing countries.  Remittances and out migration are related to these variables and reflect increases in GDP, fixed capital formation, household consumption, domestic credit, and savings. These increases suggest that remittances are used for not only daily living expenses, but for productive purposes, including the creation of micro-enterprises."
0,"This article analyzes the effect of three aspects of physical attractiveness (facial attractiveness, Body Mass Index and height) on socio-economic and marital success over the life course. In a sample of high school graduates from Wisconsin followed from their late teens and until their mid-60s, I find that (1. taller men have higher earnings than shorter men throughout their careers, (2. women with more attractive faces and women with lower Body Mass Index have higher socio-economic status late in their careers, (3. men and women with more attractive faces are more likely to be married in youth, and (4. men and women's physical attractiveness is unrelated to the income and socio-economic status of their spouses. These results suggest that, first, physical attractiveness matters throughout the life course, second, attractiveness does not have a large quantitative effect on socio-economic and marital outcomes and third, different aspects of physical attractiveness matter differently for men and women."
0,"Both the advocates of lean production and those proposing a model of High Performance Work Organization (HWPO) claim that worker empowerment is a necessary component of the each system. In both cases, a package of  high involvement work practices promoting worker participation in problem solving and decision-making are said to empower workers, thereby increasing work motivation and satisfaction. Based on interviews with workers and managers in manufacturing plants, I argue that a high involvement labor process does not necessarily improve the work experience because there is an indeterminate relationship between work organization, job satisfaction and motivation. Additionally, if meaningful empowerment is defined to include formal authority and effective capacity, it is not a necessary outcome of the transition to lean production. I show that: (a) effective packages of lean practices may involve very little meaningful empowerment; (b) nominal empowerment, under which workers fail to experience the continuous improvement process as their own or any other increase in their power, is common (while meaningful empowerment was only observed in a unionized setting); (c) and in any case, meaningful empowerment is not systematically connected to motivation and satisfaction  disempowered workers can be very motivated and satisfied while empowered ones unmotivated and dissatisfied."
0,"Siedman argues that the decline of popular movements in South Africa during the apartheid regime led to the rise of radicalism and the African National Congress. (Seidman 1999) This is consistent with the literature on movement cycles and repression. (Bjørgo and Horgan 2009; Brockett 1993; Davenport, Johnston, and Mueller 2005; Tarrow 1995; Zwerman and Steinhoff 2005) However, the reverse may also be true: that the decline of such radicalism can also lead to an increase in popular movements. The phenomenon of a decline of radicalization within the social movement milleu has not been adequately understood. In Colombia, the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) guerilla movement has now been in decline for at least twenty years. (Arias and Maldonado 2004) This has led to a rise in popular movements on the non-violent Left in Colombia. (Osorio and Weinstein 1998) When Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung was published in 1964, Marxist revolution seemed achievable to many. Anti-colonial movements were raging at the time and it was also the year that that the FARC was founded. The FARC was one rebel army in a wave of revolutionary movements across the globe. While this tide has long since receded, the FARC, just a vestige of what they once were, remains entrenched in the jungles while losing support in the cities."
0,"This paper draws on my first hand participation as the Volunteer and Interpretation Coordinator at Smith Plantation to examine how histories are made and re-made on a day-to-day basis through tour interactions and institutional practices. I argue that history is best understood as something that is done. I ground my analysis of history as accomplishment through a discussion of the creation of narratives about slavery for tourist consumption. In order to understand this construction, or “doing,” I examine institutional practices, shifting institutional concerns, and tour interactions in relation to tour discourse. I conclude that history must be understand as an embodied practice that emerges in relation to institutional dynamics and tour interactions. History emerges as a dynamic process configured and reconfigured at the intersections of structural forces and lived experience."
0,"The objective of this paper is to narrow a prevalent gap between theoretical and empirical retirement research. While theoretically the importance of understanding retirement as a process of sequentially linked states is emphasized, most empirical research focuses on retirement as a discrete transition. We explore the potential of sequence analysis to empirically assess pathways to old age pension as holistic entities in a comprehensive analysis of the cohort born between 1930 and 1940 in West Germany. We argue that initial criticism of sequence analysis has triggered a second wave of promising problem-oriented methodological advances. Our results demonstrate the particular applicability of a recent advancement in sequence analysis for the analysis of retirement processes; the Hamming dissimilarity measure emphasizing timing within sequences. We identify typical transitory pathways to old age pension, as well as nonstandard trajectories often excluded from discrete retirement models. The identified groups of sequentially equivalent micro trajectories reflect social structures shaped by the German pension system and welfare institutions."
0,"While elaborating a new theory of social class, Aage B. Sørensen (1996, 2000) argued that selective rent destruction is one source of the increase in earnings inequality witnessed in the 1980s and 1990s.  In this article, we develop the rent destruction conjecture and then test two implications of it, analyzing yearly data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups of the Current Population Surveys.  After demonstrating with alternative definitions of social class that the earnings of workers at the bottom of the class distribution have declined relative to the earnings of those at the top, we then show that the variance of wage premia associated with employment in alternative industries declined relatively more for the working class.  Adopting the position from the economics literature that these industry wage premia are reasonable measures of industry rents, we conclude that the results support the rent destruction conjecture."
0,"ABSTRACT: This study builds on the body of literature on the relationship between gender and distress and attempts to synthesize findings on gender role orientation with the self-salience theory with regard to gender and distress using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Wave III. Consistent with previous research, it was found that being female is associated with greater levels of depressive symptoms. Interestingly, strongly identifying with the feminine gender role orientation was found to decrease levels of depressive symptoms. Finally, not identifying with either gender role orientation was found to be related to increased levels of depressive symptoms. The implications of these findings as well as suggestions for future research are discussed."
0,"In this paper, I examine the efforts of personal care workers to gain security through unionization and its impact on people with disabilities. I draw on a case study of the dominant model of service delivery in Ontario  delivery by non-profit organizations contracted to the government  using policy analysis and key informant interviews.  The paper is organized into three sections.  The first section describes the interpersonal and intermittent nature of personal care work, and the two vulnerable groups engaged in care work: racialized women and men as workers and people with disabilities as clients/consumers. Section two outlines the difficulties of organizing personal care workers under an industrial labour relations regime, including the need to establish than an organization, rather than an individual, is the employer and structural problems due to the fact that collective bargaining legislation is based on the norm of a direct and continuous, employment relationship with one employer where the work is performed at a single, formal worksite.  Moving to the case study, section three focuses on how part-time, shift and on-call workers have won fair wages, extended benefits and the ability to enforce fair labour standards by joining Local 40 of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) yet highlights how the industrial labor relations regime does not fit well with the demands of people with disabilities for a more flexible delivery of services. This case illustrates the need for a new labour relations regime that can bring security with flexibility to both workers and clients/consumers."
0,"This research investigates the roles and the consequences of relational embeddedness on inter-organizational cooperation.  Using an original data set on computer motherboard manufacturers, I propose a contingency argument for the effects of relational embeddedness that captures how firm characteristics such as age differences can alter the effects relational embeddedness has on organizational performance.  Results find that the lag effects of embeddedness vary depending on organizational age.  Conclusions include that a closer supplier relationship improves an organizations chances of survival for younger organizations more than it helps older firms.  Implications for future embeddedness research and other possible contingencies are discussed."
0,"An emerging body of research shows that perceived discrimination adversely influences the mental health of minority populations, but is it also deleterious to physical health? If yes, can marriage buffer the effect of perceived discrimination on physical health? We address these questions with data from Puerto Rican and Mexican American residents of Chicago.  Multivariate regression analyses reveal that perceived discrimination is associated with a greater number of physical health problems for both Puerto Rican and Mexican Americans.  Marriage has health-protective effects, however, for Mexican Americans only.  In addition, an interaction effect between marital status and perceived discrimination was observed for Mexican Americans:  married Mexican Americans who reported higher perceived discrimination had fewer physical health problems than their unmarried counterparts.  The findings reveal that perceived discrimination has deleterious effects on physical health of both Puerto Rican and Mexican Americans, but that the buffering effect of marriage exists for Mexican Americans only."
0,"Survey researchers often administer batteries of questions to measure respondents' abilities, but these batteries are not always designed in keeping with the principles of optimal test construction. This paper illustrates one instance in which following these principles can improve a measurement tool used widely in the social and behavioral sciences: the GSS's vocabulary test called ""Wordsum"". This ten-item test is composed of very difficult items and very easy items, and item response theory (IRT) suggests that the omission of moderately difficult items is likely to have handicapped Wordsum's effectiveness. Analyses of data from national samples of thousands of American adults show that after adding four moderately difficult items to create a 14-item battery, ""Wordsumplus"" (1) outperformed the original battery in terms of quality indicators suggested by classical test theory; (2) reduced the standard error of IRT ability estimates in the middle of the latent ability dimension; and (3) exhibited higher concurrent validity. These findings show how to improve Wordsum and suggest that analysts should use a score based on all 14 items instead of using the summary score provided by the GSS, which is based on only the original 10 items. These results also show more generally how surveys measuring abilities (and other constructs) can benefit from careful application of insights from the contemporary educational testing literature.

0,"Status generalization is a process in which nominal characteristics that have status value in the larger society, so-called  status characteristics, affect individuals’ assumptions about each other’s abilities and skills in small group contexts. Although existing research has provided important insights into how status generalization processes can affect mutual ability attributions, it has been limited by its focus on experimental settings. In this paper we argue that  in-group  favoritism  might interfere with status generalization processes in naturally occurring groups. Focusing on the status characteristic gender, we test our predictions with social network data from 17 Hungarian secondary school classes. Contrary to expectations, our analyses suggest that both status generalization and a weak form of in-group favoritism occurred at the same time and created a complex pattern of ability attributions."
0,"In industrialized societies, the primary social expectation for youth is academic attainment. However, research consistently finds that adolescents often place greater emphasis on peer status and social acceptance than academic success. This study examines the individual characteristics and attributes associated with peer status and how these criteria are potentially moderated by gender, grade level and school contexts. It relies on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to identify status-related characteristics and test theoretically derived hypotheses. Contrary to the hypothesis that delinquency increases peer status by overcoming a maturity gap (Moffitt 1993), findings suggest that high-rate male delinquency is unrelated to sociometric measures of status. Although a positive association is found between female delinquency and friendship network size, this relationship declines significantly with grade level. Additionally, results support the hypothesis that non-athletic activities provide opportunities for once-rejected youth to connect with similarly situated peers. Through the high school grades, band participation, but not academic success, is found to significantly increase male sociometric status. Finally, several status criteria - including sports participation, student government, band, and delinquency - vary by school context, suggesting that local structural conditions are important contributors to student social relations."
0,"The recently established tenets of resiliency theory indicate clear distinctions between students of color who have the propensity -- and do -- excel academically and those who do not. Furthermore, the theory presumes resilient youth tend to acculturate. However, recent studies of college-bound students of color focusing on African Americans and Latinos indicate there are distinct instances of resiliency between student populations and within cultural or ethnic groups. The findings suggest that the ways in which resilient students choose to manage hardships are far more divergent and complex than previously assumed."
0,"In this paper, we examine educational differences in married women's labor force attachment in Japan using 10 waves of data from a nationally representative survey. Results of discrete-time multi-state hazard models of labor force exit and entry indicate that university graduates are both more likely to remain in and less likely to reenter the labor force relative to women with a high school education or less. Their relatively low likelihood of labor force exit reflects educational differences in occupational characteristics, especially employment in full-time, standard jobs. However, junior college and university graduates remain substantially less likely to reenter the labor force net of family circumstances, characteristics of previous employment, and efforts to control for unobserved characteristics. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that tension between emerging incentives to remain in the labor force and lingering incentives to remain out of the labor force are both relatively strong among highly educated women. We conclude with speculation about the implications of these educational differences in married women's employment for stratification. "
0,"American Latinos are increasingly identified in the social science literature as a ""racialized minority."" A number of problems attend this characterization, including the historically ambiguous status of Latinos in American society. A more basic problem lies in the concept of racialization itself and in its root term race. The argument here is that social discourses should be labeled as racial only if they refer to groups that are hierarchically ranked on the basis of mental and moral qualities seen as innate or inherent. Innateness, not phenotype, is the core attribute of racial discourses. Racialization then should refer only to those situations where such discourses are applied to an ethnic group, and a great deal of research shows that is not the case for Latinos, or for other contemporary American minorities. Given the developments in ethnicity theory since Fredrik Barth's groundbreaking 1969 work, it makes sense to consider racial discourses a historically specific subset of ethnic discourses and practices. Latinos are thus best seen as a panethnic group."
0,"Despite women's advancement in the workplace over the past 40 years, their representation in top-level positions remains disproportionately low relative to that of men. This raises the question of what factors drive greater gender equality in managerial ranks. Using national equal employment opportunity (EEO-1) data for the supermarket industry, this article proposes that high-profile sex discrimination lawsuit filings provide the type of intense pressure that leads to increased female managerial representation. Results from fixed-effects models demonstrate the significance of litigation in the short and long run, especially for women employed by supermarkets located in the most progressive U. S. appellate court jurisdictions. The findings also provide support for a normative effect on change based on regional variation in public orientation toward gender equality."
0,"Education is weakly related to employment for some groups of US. women. As such, it may be less of a resource for reducing gender inequality than commonly believed. Drawing on ethnographic field notes and in-depth interviews with Arab Americans, we recast the motivations and consequences of female education in terms of cultural schemas and resources and then analyze the processes that underlie the education-employment link in ethnic and religious contexts. Arab American women are a particularly useful case study because they have higher educational attainments but lower employment rates than most other groups of US. women. Our findings shed light on this paradox. Arab Americans universally support female education as a resource, not for economic mobility, but to ensure the proper socialization of children, solidarity of the family, and ultimately the maintenance of ethnic and religious identity. Contrary to the widely held assumption that female education will equalize gender power dynamics, our results highlight how and when women education may reproduce patriarchal gender relations. This is the case in religious and ethnic contexts where women forgo market opportunities to fuffill familial responsibilities, and where parents and children view female education as a collective family resource-a resource to be invested in the home rather than in the market."
0,"This paper represents an extension of contemporary feminist thinking on the topic of male circumcision. Current feminist and sociological work on the practice tends to conceive of male circumcision as an act solidifying male power and hegemony. While aptly criticizing aspects of circumcision, this type of explanation over simplifies, assuming that hegemony is assigned to circumcised status, while uncircumcised/intact status is subordinate. This misses the significant claims intact and anti-circumcision men make for their own hegemony. Both pro- and anti-circumcision men assert their privilege, maintaining their self-control, professing their unquestionable (hetero)sexuality, declaring their undeniable masculinity. The institution of hegemonic masculinity, threatened as it is by recent economic crises and changes in the workplace, has found assistance in the male circumcision debate; rather than dividing men, it unites them by their common bond—privilege and power. The presence of alternative masculinities challenges the hegemonic regime and suggests room for change."
0,"Sociological studies suggest that there is social change occurring in the acceptance of lesbians and gay men in the workplace. Compared to prior decades, there are more businesses that welcome, value, and even privilege nonheterosexual sexual identities and relationships. Few studies have analyzed workers' experiences in these types of work contexts. In this article, we explore the experiences of ""out"" LGB women and men who work for organizations that they consider ""gay-friendly."" In-depth interviews demonstrated that, although gay and lesbian workers feel that they are accepted in ""gay-friendly"" organizations, they nevertheless described differential treatment because of their sexual identity. We discuss evidence of stereotyping, sexual harassment, and gender discrimination in their work experiences. Although the movement toward greater acceptance of gays and lesbians in the workplace has made significant progress, the transformation is so far incomplete. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research for the study of equality in organizations."
0,"Migrant remittances from the United States to Mexico have grown at an impressive rate in recent years. Using a decomposition technique, I attribute the growth in remittances,for the 1990-2004 period and subperiods within it, to a migration effect, a remitting propensity effect and an average amount effect. Results show that while migration growth was the main force driving remittance growth for most of the 1990s, in the new century remittance growth cannot be simply attributed to migration growth. Mexican migrants are becoming more likely to remit and are remitting larger amounts. This reflects both a change in the composition of the Mexican population in the United States and new modes of immigrant incorporation, consistent with the assimilation and the transnational narratives. Macroeconomic oscillations play an important role in explaining remittance growth as well."
0,"Much of the research on emotion work in organizations has focused on the ways in which emotional performance reproduces gender inequality. Yet, most of these studies overlook the racial character of professional workplaces and how emotion work is experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. In this article, I examine how the normative feeling rules that guide emotional performance in professional workplaces are racialized rather than neutral or objective criteria. Based on 25 semistructured interviews with black professionals, I contend that feeling rules have different implications for black workers and ultimately reinforce racial difference. This research contributes to the sociological literature on emotion work by further developing the racial components of emotional performance."
0,"Although played out on a global stage, 9/11 and the Iraq War represent highly personal events for those connected to the victims. A social tie to a conflict casualty transforms abstract costs into a vivid personal experience that increases the likelihood an individual disapproves of the president. Despite variation between civilian and military losses and historically high and low levels of presidential support, those who know 9/11 or Iraq War casualties are consistently more likely to disapprove of President Bush, suggesting that social structure, and not just personal characteristics, influence wartime opinion."
0,"Vaccines have historically been viewed with a complicated and often fluctuating mixture of hope and optimism, and skepticism and ambivalence.  Recent concerns center on possible long-term iatrogenic effects of vaccines, including chronic disorders such as autism.  Our understanding of autism as a clinical entity has undergone several major paradigmatic shifts in its short history.  No definitive cause has yet been found, however, and a new line of thought suggests a genetic vulnerability to an environmental exposure.  There is currently both an increased skepticism on the part of the lay public about the utility of many vaccines, and also a fundamental change brewing in our understanding of autism.  This coincidence has brought these two strands of public opinion and medical knowledge on a track toward one another, and holds power to transform both how we view autism and how we view vaccines as a public health intervention.  Further research is needed to determine the viability of the vaccine and autism hypothesis; the outcome of these investigations could have a dramatic impact on our assessment of the costs and benefits of vaccines as a public health strategy."
0,"This paper analyzes violence, the discursive practices of “violence prevention policies” in schools and their relationship to anti-Black racism in the United States.Through examining a particular case study set in a diverse suburb in Northern California, this study investigates how multi-level anti-violence policies and practices frame popular understandings of youth violence, shape racial formations and experiences with violence in schools.  This paper finds that the contemporary discourse of violence prevention displaces and erases structural critiques of the relationship(s) between race, violence and discipline. According to student narratives, in addition to disproportionately punishing marginalized youth of color, anti-violence practices in schools mischaracterize their experiences with violence. Based upon students’ perceptions of their lived experiences, this paper finds that anti-Black racism structures how students understand their experiences and that instead of offering protection from and prevention of violence, students believe that the policies help to enable and authorize violence, particularly anti-Black racism."
0,"By focusing on one of the most excluded populations in the EU, this paper seeks to elucidate the internal frontiers to social protection and healthcare access within the French healthcare system. It will expound the current legal framework concerning Roma peoples health rights in France. It will go on to present a critical analysis of Roma peoples use of healthcare services, as well as their itineraries of care. Qualitative fieldwork was conducted, based on triangulation of these methods of data production: documentary review of local, regional and national policies concerning health rights for minorities, and a series of focused interviews with members of Roma families and in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals and members of the associative sector. Quantitative data has been analyzed by Category-specific and Thematic Contents Analysis, using Atlas-ti5. This qualitative fieldwork is taking place in threes sites close to Paris: 1) a shanty town where hundreds of Roma families live, 2) a collective emergency housing project, and 3) a town where a successful program of integration of Roma people is claimed to have taken place. The main conclusions are, firstly, that there are strong barriers to healthcare access for Roma minorities in France; secondly, that there is evidence pointing to violation of health rights in France, since the entrance of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 to the EU and, thirdly, that the logics of racialization go a long way towards explaining the construction of internal frontiers in social protection and healthcare access."
0,"Reducing smoking rates in the U.S. to approximately 23% of the population is a great success story for public health, but public health has focused insufficiently on young adults, particularly those not attending college.   Recent survey data from Baltimore,  reveal that in some inner-city communities, over half of the young adults (18-24 years old) smoke cigarettes. This paper explores the community level factors contributing to high smoking rates among young adults in Baltimore.  Our analysis is based on focus group data from a one-year community based participatory research project with two job training organizations (Urban Youth Corps and Youth Build in Sandtown-Winchester). We present data from four focus groups with 28 program participants (23 smokers and 5 non-smokers).  Our analysis focuses on two emergent themes. First, the importance that participants placed on sharing cigarettes and smoking together, and second, the impact of ubiquitous loose cigarette vendors within the community on cigarette acquisition.   We conclude that there are community-specific factors that specifically undermine existing tobacco prevention efforts at the policy level.  Policy planning needs to include a consideration of the impact of community  structures on implementation, in order to reduce health disparities caused by smoking, instead of facilitating widening the gap."
0,"In the 1930s, the colonies of British Malaya and US Philippines were beset by labor uprisings. In both cases, political administration lurched toward bonapartism, when the deadlock between imperial capital and native labor was resolved in the dictatorship of the colonial state. The formation of colonial bonapartisms however diverged. In Malaya the British governor embodied a dictatorship softened by institutional-racial compacts, while the US delegated the dictatorship to an autonomous Commonwealth state. This paper explains the divergence in terms of class formation and ethnographic ideology. British capitalist ownership made it difficult to conciliate the demands of the Chinese proletariat, while lack of US capitalist investment allowed it to withdraw from direct rule and support a client state against land-starved peasants. Ethnographic ideology determined the British policy of support the traditional Malay elites against the economically preponderant Chinese and the US policy of supporting Filipino mestizo elites as civilized guardians of a client state. This comparative analysis suggests that colonial bonapartism influenced the variable constitution of post-colonial states. Strong bonapartism (Philippines) leads to a weakly institutionalized state dependent on patron-supported coercion, while weak bonapartism (Malaya) leads to a strongly institutionalized state dependent on racial consensus to maintain the class status quo."
0,"Scholars of environmental and ecological economics, political ecology, globalization, and environmental regulatory regimes have studied the ways that privatization, commodification, and marketization are shaping environmental governance around the world. Such research provides important critiques of capitalist approaches to addressing environmental problems, but also often implies that economically oriented environmental governance is necessarily evidence of “global” trends toward “marketization” and “neoliberalization”. The analysis presented herein suggests that such generalizations may obfuscate as much as elucidate the character of newly emerging economic approaches to environmental governance. A finer grained analysis of (1) cap-and-trade emissions reduction schemes,  (2) payments for ecosystem services, and (3) conservation banking is presented in order to illustrate the variegated nature of allegedly global, neoliberal and marketized environmental governance. Findings first suggest that these three examples of economically oriented environmental governance are not uniformly distributed around the world and thus should not be labeled as part of a truly global trend. Second, none of the three examples are found to be meaningfully neoliberal since all require strong state interventions into the economy. Third, it is argued that not all examples of economically oriented environmental governance can be meaningfully categorized as capitalist, since some may not generate surplus value via exchange. Implications are discussed for theories of states and non-economic reasons for governance. Finally, it is suggested that political, ideological and economic factors must all be integrated into any complete theoretical account of emerging forms of economically oriented environmental governance, such as payments for ecosystem services and conservation banking."
0,"This article examines the causes of financial malfeasance in the largest U.S. corporations between 1995 and 2004. The findings support organizational-political embeddedness theory, which suggests that differential social structures create dependencies, incentives, and opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance. The historical analysis shows that neoliberal policies enacted between 1986 and 2000 resulted in organizational and political structures that permitted managers to engage in financial malfeasance. Our quantitative analysis provides three main findings. First, capital dependence on investors creates incentives to engage in financial malfeasance. Second, managerial strategies to increase shareholder value create incentives to engage in financial malfeasance. Third, the multilayer-subsidiary form and the political structure permitting corporate PAC contributions create opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance. These findings have important implications for public policy; the corporate and state structures enacted in the late-twentieth century were the outcome of a long-term, well-financed, and systematic political strategy that provided managers with unprecedented power, autonomy, and opportunity to engage in financial malfeasance."
0,"At least since the time of Popper, scientists have understood that science provides falsification, but not ""proof."" In the world of environmental and technological controversies, however, many observers continue to call precisely for ""proof,"" often under the guise of ""scientific certainty."" Closer examination of real-world disputes suggests that such calls may reflect not just a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of science, but a clever and surprisingly effective political-economic tactic-""Scientific Certainty"" Argumentation Methods, or SCAMs. Given that most scientific findings are inherently probabilistic and ambiguous, if agencies can be prevented from imposing any regulations until they are unambiguously ""justified,"" most regulations can be defeated or postponed, often for decades, allowing profitable but potentially risky activities to continue unabated. An exploratory examination of previously documented controversies suggests that SCAMs are more widespread than has been recognized in the past, and that they deserve greater attention in the future."
0,"Beyond mothers' union status transitions, other adults' transitions into and out of the household contribute to family instability, particularly in early childhood. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (N congruent to 8550). this study examines associations between extended household transitions and age 2 cognitive development. A substantial minority of toddlers experiences these transitions, and their consequences vary by household member type, entry versus exit, and race/ethnicity. Extended household transitions predict lower cognitive scores for white children, but the selection of low-socioeconomic status families into extended households explains these disparities. Grandparent transitions predict significantly higher cognitive scores for African American and Latino children than whites, and some ""other adult"" transitions predict higher scores for Latinos than African Americans and whites. Extended household transitions' consequences are independent of co-occurring residential moves and partner transitions. Findings suggest that studying extended household transitions is useful for understanding children's early development, and their consequences vary by race/ethnicity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Falling under the rubric of ""post-gay,"" recent changes in gay life challenge theoretical accounts of collective identity by creating effects that, while acknowledged, have not yet been articulated using a parsimonious and portable framework. Consistent with conventional wisdom. LGBT activists construct collective identity using an oppositional ""us versus them"" formation during those times when they strategically deploy their differences from heterosexuals. But what happens when activists seek to emphasize their similarities to straights, as they are motivated to do during a post-gay moment? Drawing on interview and archival data of a college LGBT student organization, this article argues that in a post-gay era, activists construct collective identity using an inclusive, distinction-muting logic of ""us and them."" The shift from opposition (""versus"") to inclusion (""and"") implies that activists today are motivated less by drawing boundaries against members of the dominant group and more by building bridges toward them. The article concludes with critiques of and implications for post-gay politics."
0,"This paper adds to the developing consensus that the origins of neoliberalism were rooted in the white struggles against the civil rights movement.  During the construction of the interstate highway system, the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) was unable to prevent federal regulations over signs that accompanied the 1958 Bonus Act, in part, because they were a federal lobbying group that had no connection with local elites.  While southern planters and industrialists opposed federal regulations over labor laws and desegregation, they were not going to forgo federal funds to benefit the service sector.  However, when federal billboard regulations outlawed signs by the Ku Klux Klan, local segregationists became engaged in a policy debate they otherwise did not care about and ultimately pressured Alabama and other southern states to opt out of the Bonus Act.  In the process, deregulation became attached to the black/public signifier and allowed southern whites to secure and direct federal money to the white power structure while simultaneously forgoing federal funds that may have benefited southern blacks and rural whites."
0,"To suppress political challengers is to counter-mobilize, primarily an organizational phenomenon that behooves state agents who have some interest in the status quo to give collective answers to a dual problems: to repress the unruly and to simultaneously maintain the state organization.  This paper highlights the necessary organizational work that may resolve these dual problems at once.  Using the configuration of the state bureaucracy as a proxy to the structure of organizational work that goes into a states counter-mobilization effort, I will examine how the Qing bureaucratic structure responded to one of the most powerful social rebellions in the history of the Manchu regime, the Taiping Rebellion (1851-64). The states initial response to the formidable Taiping force depended generally on a direct-control policy, realized by sending centrally-linked officials and military officers to the provinces.  This strategy soon became inefficient because it had, among other reasons, prevented locally rooted officials from upward mobility in provincial administration.  A new local strategy was developed with an emphasis on positive reward and less direct means of control. Dramatic change in the bureaucratic structure is evidenced, and potential implication of these changes will be discussed."

0,"While South Asians are among the fastest growing and most affluent ethnic groups in the country, there is a dearth of empirically based research on South Asian panethnicity and specifically on pan-South Asian identity.  This paper examines the meaning of South Asian, the degree to which individuals of South Asian descent relate to being South Asian, and the various dimensions of and implications behind the term itself.  The analysis is based on in-depth interviews with 120 first-, 1.5-, and second-generation Indian Hindu, Pakistani Muslim, and Sikh informants (community leaders) and respondents (community members).  It is argued that while South Asian was once an identity imposed from above, it is being claimed from below by individuals of South Asian descent as a distinct political and cultural identity in the United States.  It is also suggested that a pan-South Asian identity and institutions will become more developed over time, and that South Asians pose a model of panethnicity that is in some ways similar to and different from previous models."
0,"In this paper, the role of family drinking and drug use in college student drinking is examined. While there have been studies of this issue, the evidence is mixed as to whether college students with a family history of drinking are more likely to drink than are those whose family does not drink. We advance this issue through an investigation that considers race and gender differences, and by examining how drug use by family members may contribute to student drinking. The data for this study come from a survey of 1,600 college students in a Midwestern state. Results show that while having relatives who are problem drinkers is associated with greater substance use for college students, the effects of having drug dependent relatives is even greater. Further, significant interactions by race and gender are found. The substance use behavior of white young women is particularly affected by having drug dependent relatives."
0,"We fare sanctions are financial penalties applied to individuals who fail to comply with welfare program rules. Their widespread tee reflects a turn toward disciplinary approaches to poverty management. In this article, we investigate how implicit racial biases and discrediting social markers interact to shape officials' decisions to impose sanctions. We present experimental evidence based on hypothetical vignettes that case managers are more likely to recommend sanctions for Latina and black clients-but not white clients-when discrediting markers are present. We triangulate these findings with analyses of state administrative data. Our results for Latinas are mixed, but we find consistent evidence that the probability of a sanction rises significantly when a discrediting marker (i.e., a prior sanction for noncompliance) is attached to a black rather than a white welfare client. Overall, our study clarifies how racial minorities, especially, African Americans, are more likely to be punished for deviant behavior in the new world of disciplinary we fare provision."
0,"As a part of welfare reform, states throughout the country have enacted legislation to promote marriage. Lawmakers believe that by promoting marriage, the states will achieve lower divorce rates and lower rates of cohabitation by converting cohabitating couples into more stable married households, which in turn will lead to fewer women and children utilizing welfare programs. To determine the impact of state-level legislation, we analyze state-level 1990 and 2000 data in light of sixteen different state-level policy variables that were designed to increase marriage rates, decrease divorce rates, or otherwise have ''pro-family'' outcomes. This analysis shows few if any compelling differences between states that have enacted these various measures and those that have not."
0,"A discussion of the social effects or collateral consequences of the American phenomenon of mass incarceration on social and family life has emerged in recent years.  Keenly attuned to the poverty, unemployment, and other socio-economic burdens shouldered by those most affected by the United States punitive penal policies, researchers tend to position incarceration as the catalyst of these woes  that is, being sentenced to spend time in jail or prison is claimed to be the disruptive force that results in job loss, family disintegration, and the like.  While punitive confinement does trigger an ever-increasing array of civil penalties, an in-depth analysis of womens romantic relationships with prisoners demonstrates that correctional institutions can grant a considerable means of control to women in their dealings with men.  Indeed, in the near-total absence of basic social services characterizing the United States today, prisons appear as structures for enacting the gendered roles of nurturer and caregiver as well as substitute sites for domestic and conjugal life that, paradoxically, may be preferable to or easier to manage than the chaos and stress of the family home.  This paper draws upon ethnographic observation at northern Californias San Quentin State Prison and interviews with 50 women whose husband, fiancé, or boyfriend was incarcerated to analyze how impoverished women  in the absence of mental-health services, substance-abuse treatment, domestic-violence intervention, and other social-welfare assistance for themselves and their partners  engage the criminal justice system as a protective intervention in their relationships with difficult or dangerous men."
0,"How do Latino immigrants in the United States understand existing racial categories? And how does the existing U.S. racial order influence this understanding? Using data from the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), our analysis points to changes in how the U.S. racial order might operate in the future. We find that most Latino immigrants recognize the advantages of a White racial designation when asked to self-identify, but wider society is not often accepting of this White expansion. Our findings suggest that relatively darker-skinned Latino immigrants experience skin-color-based discrimination in the realm of annual income. Furthermore, Latinos who are most integrated into the United States are the most likely to opt out of the existing U.S. racial categorization scheme. We predict that a racial boundary is forming around some Latino immigrants: those with darker skin and those who have more experience in the U.S. racial stratification system."
0,"Using a pooled sample constructed from recent installments of the Displaced Workers Survey, this study examines the racial disparities in postdisplacement outcomes while controlling for the predisplacement experience and earnings of individual workers. It finds no racial difference in the reemployment wage, but there is a large racial disparity in the chances of reemployment among workers with equivalent characteristics and experience. This lower reemployment rate of displaced black workers may be due to individual differences in search behavior, but it is also consistent with contemporary accounts of hiring discrimination."
0,"Expanding on Blumers theory of prejudice as a sense of group position and Allports eclectic approach with an emphasis on a multileveled understanding of inter-group relations, this paper examines the role of perceived threat on the level of prejudice towards immigrants and minorities. Using a hierarchical linear model, I analyze the additive and interactive effects of macro-level group threat and individuals perception of threat on prejudice. The results show that individuals perception of threat is the most powerful factor in explaining prejudice. Compared with the impact of fluctuations in economic and social conditions, individuals perceptions of threat have a stronger effect on prejudice. The results also indicate that effects of individual characteristics on prejudice are further strengthened in countries where macro-level threat is higher."
0,"How has Information Technology (IT) penetrated our life?  Given its near-ubiquity, I contend it may be time to consider IT as a candidate for a social institution, albeit an emerging one.  To define IT, I apply Orlikowski and Iacono’s (2001) ensemble view that recognizes its proliferation has to jointly consider both its technical components and attendant social negotiation. While I offer provisional evidence that IT exhibits characteristics of social institutions, it may be premature to claim it has become a full-fledged one, given its recent prevalence. Furthermore, how it is becoming one remains unclear.  To that, I draw on Max Weber’s rationalization theory as one possible explanation. Using selected data from the 1979-2001 National Science Foundation Surveys of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology, my findings also surface an interesting challenge to how current literature theorizes the relationship between formal and substantive rationality.  Last, I highlight the limitations of my study and suggest potential streams of research that will profit by treating IT as a nascent social institution."
0,"As compared to other ethnic groups in the United States, Latinos have been shown to have slightly lower levels of school performance.  Researchers have often pointed to such characteristics as lower family incomes and greater numbers of children as reasons for their lower levels of academic success.  Previous studies have also suggested that language abilities, particularly English skills, may present barriers for Latino children to perform well in school.  Using data from the 2004 Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles survey, this study directly examines the relative impact of family structure and language characteristics on the school performance and educational attainment of young adult Latinas and Latinos.  Overall, Latinas are shown to have slightly better Spanish skills than males.  Latinas’ educational attainment appears to be more susceptible to the influence of language characteristics, particularly in regard to having deficient English skills.  The implications of these findings and the unique nature of Latino childhood socialization are discussed."
0,"The present study examines the influence of external debt on the change in the proportion of the total population living in urban slum conditions in the less developed countries between 1990 and 2010, drawing from a political economy of the world-system theoretical perspective. Ordinary least squares panel regression illustrates external debt as a percent of gross national income has a statistically significant positive effect producing higher levels of urban slum growth. This result is recurrent across all developing countries but is particularly strong among sub-Saharan African nations. Further, urban population growth 1960-1990 exhibits a positive effect contributing to higher urban slum growth. The results support the hypothesis that external debt burden is an important factor contributing to higher levels of urban slum growth in the less developed countries between 1990 and 2010. This effect, moreover, is particularly strong among sub-Saharan African countries relative to developing countries within other regions of the world."
0,"Work and family scholars have yet to thoroughly address an emerging issue in the field, which is that increasingly in the new economy, families from different social classes and groups have differential access to and experiences of security.  This paper, based on interviews with fifty families from the top to the bottom of the social structure in Silicon Valley, and ethnographic research with a subset of these families, explores this phenomenon of the ""inequality of security.""  My analysis finds that upper-income families are largely buffeted from risk by virtue of high incomes, in-demand skills, dense social networks, stable benefits, and the possession of distinct cultural capacities often required to succeed in the ""risk society.""  In contrast, middle and lower-income families are more often exposed to risk because of comparatively lower earnings, less in-demand skills, less stable benefits, and different cultural practices.  As a result, ""the inequality of security"" has profound implications for work and family life since families are unevenly and unequally positioned to see, plan for, experience and withstand, security, insecurity and risk."
0,"Objectives. This research examines differences in insurance coverage of Hispanic subgroups of the United States. Particular attention is paid to the impact of the immigration status– including nativity, duration in the United States, and citizenship status – and its affect on insurance coverage. Data are pooled from the National Health Interview Survey for 2008-2009 and multinomial logistic regression models are estimated to compare Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban and Other Hispanics with non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks. Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans and Other Hispanics are all much more likely than non-Hispanic whites to report Miscellaneous Insurance Coverage or No Coverage than Private Insurance Coverage. Cubans are not significantly different than non-Hispanic whites to have public health insurance coverage than private insurance. There are wide differences in insurance coverage across racial and ethnic groups in the United States."
0,"This paper examines the union-centric character of the sociology of labor revitalization and the analytic problems that result from it.  Specifically, the tendency of labor scholars to focus primarily on unions may lead to excluding from research and theorizing, the contributions being made by community-based labor organizations operating outside the collective bargaining framework.  Using the Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles as an example, I show that trade unions are not the only organizational form the labor movement might take. And that alternative forms are well-suited to organize in industries such as apparel manufacturing, where collective bargaining is not viable.  I conclude by calling for a more expansive conceptualization of the labor movement in order to capture the innovations taking place in the space between unions."
0,": Like all movements, contemporary global movements draw on and share characteristics of earlier movements. However, there are some significant features of the contemporary global movements that reflect the changing context in which they operate and which distinguish them from earlier NSMs. Drawing on a variety of academic and activist sources, including findings drawn from an in-depth ethnography of an anti-capitalist autonomous network in Madrid from July 2002-January 2005, the author highlights in particular the centrality of the notion of autonomy and the creation of autonomous spaces; the centrality of issues of participatory democracy; the emergence of a new global actor who identifies with a global movement; the consolidation of the network as organizational framework and of the sovereign assembly as legitimate arena for decision making; the strong resurgence of anarchist and libertarian influence; a repertory of action that moves beyond the purely symbolic to a re-engagement with capitalism as the focus of direct action and critique; a shift away from identitarian and ideological politics to an embracing of diversity as a core value; the re-definition of the public sphere as a commons, but also as an arena in which to negotiate conflict and difference; and in Western Europe at least, the emerging consciousness of a precarious subject."
0,"We explore the effect that the school environment has on students commitment and determination to participate in their own education, with particular attention to the experiences of first generation immigrants and African American students. In contrast to current theories, we distinguish between belief in education and commitment to school. In an environment in which ineffective control and non-engaging classes predominantly characterize the relationship of schools to their students, it is not clear that students would be socialized into the schools values and goals. Students need to develop strategies that allow them to remain committed to education while surviving their day to day in a unsafe, academically limited school environment. These processes are sometimes seen as minority resistance to educational norms. Instead, our data suggests that the nature of the schools in which minority students find themselves has a greater influence on sustaining or dissuading students commitment to education than does their immigration status or cultural backgrounds."
0,"There are two sociological perspectives which employ a type of constructionist approach to address how the law frames the sexual abuse of children: Moral Panic Theory and Feminist Theory.  Each perspective evokes different images typical legal cases involving sexual abuse in order to argue that the law as an institution is ineffective in addressing the problem of child sexual abuse. For example, moral panic accounts of sexual abuse law emphasize faulty legal investigations, unnecessary legislation passed to curb abuse by strangers, and courtroom tendencies to unquestioningly believe children.  In contrast, feminist accounts emphasize how law enforcement and courts do not do enough to combat sexual abuse. They contend that courts construct children in ways that undermine their credibility when they raise complaints of sexual coercion and thus the law has a tendency to disbelieve children. In this paper, I compare these two perspectives on legal aspects of sexual abuse and evaluate what each perspective can offer to a sociological understanding of how sexual abuse is constructed in legal discourse. Do courts tend to believe childrens claims of sexual abuse under the presumption of defendants guilt because they are caught up in a moral panic over child sexual abuse? Or do courts tend to regard childrens claims of sexual abuse as suspect, due to their gendered or age status? I argue that the reality of how courts handle children who are victims of sexual offenses is frequently more complex than moral panic theory and feminist theories would lead us to believe. I analyzed 62 appellate court cases involving sexual offenses against children from 1976 to 1998 in terms of how children, as victims of sexual exploitation, have been handled by courts."
0,"Despite increasing interest in gendered sexuality over the life course, a comprehensive conceptual model, applicable to all aspects of sexual life and incorporating recent developments in life course sociology, feminist theory, and sexuality studies, has yet to be elaborated. The model presented here posits that sexual beliefs and behaviors result from individuals' lifelong accumulation of advantageous and disadvantageous experiences, and adoption/rejection of sexual scripts, within socio-historical contexts. Women and men follow distinctive sexual trajectories insofar as they accrue gender-specific experiences and scripts and as their sexuality and gender trajectories intertwine. Empirical examples include virginity loss and involuntary celibacy, (de) coupling, and chronic illness/disability. The proposed framework helps explain the coexistence of differences and similarities among individuals and cohorts and holds particular promise for studying lifelong aspects of sexuality like agency and interest. It also suggests improvements on interactionist theory, conventional life course models, and the sexual scripting approach."
0,"Using data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, we show that women who report that religion is ""very important"" in their everyday life have both higher fertility and higher intended fertility than those saying religion is ""somewhat important"" or ""not important."" Factors such as unwanted fertility, age at childbearing or degree of fertility postponement seem not to contribute to religiosity differentials in fertility. This answer prompts more fundamental questions: what is the nature of this greater religiosity? And why do the more religious want more children? We show that those saying religion is more important have more traditional gender and family attitudes and that these attitudinal differences account for a substantial part of the fertility differential. We speculate regarding other contributing causes."
0,Mark Twain's work Huckleberry Finn is objected to for racist language.  His purpose was making an anti-racist statement for1880s readers.  Analysis of N word use by character and interaction frame reveals racist language was highly conditioned by a character's social class.  Twain also depicts other forms of racism.  Accepting his work as plausible nineteenth century racist dialogue we get better insight into the historical reality of racism and Twain's objections to it.
0,"World economy and world society theories are engaged to assess the extent to which environmental harms in less-developed countries are tied to particular kinds of economic and social integration. Results of panel models indicate that world economy integration in the context of sector-level foreign investment contributes to a variety of environmental harms. With the exception of deforestation, world society integration in the mode of environmental international non-governmental organization presence has no direct effect. However, a stronger presence of such organizations in less-developed countries mitigates the effect of foreign investment on all tested outcomes. The authors contend that comparative sociologists should adopt theoretically integrative approaches and pay closer attention to how and under what circumstances world economy and world society factors interact to partially shape social and environmental conditions."
0,"This article explores gender and class exclusion among college students. The authors use qualitative data to explore how students talk about gender and class exclusion and quantitative data to model patterns of exclusion within the Greek system. The Greek system serves as a site for social reproduction. Students constructed young women as elitist and prone to class exclusion, while typifying young men as unconcerned with such matters. Quantitative analyses complicate these findings. Within the Greek system, women are less exclusive than alleged and men more so. This discontinuity may reflect gender stereotypes and gender differences in the embodiment of social class. The authors argue that these patterns reinforce male privilege through the assertion that they are not engaged in social class exclusion while lacing undue blame on women as agents of class reproduction."
0,"Despite great interest in the role of social networks as channels of political mobilization, few studies have examined which types of social networks work more effectively in recruiting political activists. Using the Citizen Participation Study data, this study shows that contrary to the conventional wisdom in the literature, there is little evidence that strong ties are more effective than weak ties in recruiting activists. Ties formed in civic associations, however, are more effective than other ties in recruiting protest participants. Neighborhood ties are more effective in recruiting community activists, but not in other types of activity. I conclude that the contents Of relationships and the identities shared by two people, rather than tie strength, form the basis of interpersonal influence in political activism."
0,"International poverty research has increasingly underscored the need to use multidimensional approaches to measure poverty. Largely embraced in Europe and elsewhere, this has not had much impact on the way poverty is measured in the United States. In this paper, I use a comprehensive multidimensional framework including economic well-being, capability, and social inclusion to examine poverty in the US. Data from the 2004 General Social Survey support the interconnectedness among these poverty dimensions, indicating that the multidimensional framework utilizing a comprehensive set of information provides a compelling value added to poverty measurement. The suggested demographic characteristics of the various categories of the poor are somewhat similar between this approach and other traditional approaches. But the more comprehensive and accurate measurement outcomes from this approach help policymakers target resources at the specific groups. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"In this paper, I explore one of the central struggles over the politics of globalization: creating alternatives to neoliberal strategies to open markets around the world and extend the processes of commodification and corporate control. I examine U.S. and Brazilian efforts to use free and open source software as forms of digital culture to develop new forms of digital inclusion. Indeed, they seek to create a digital form of the commons as an alternative to the dominant form of neoliberal globalization. In distinct yet complementary ways, hackers in the U.S. and government officials in Brazil seek to develop software-sharing communities that use free and open source software as forms of digital culture that allow for a new global commons. I explore three aspects of these efforts. First, I examine the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, highlighting the complexity of the process of forging alternatives to neoliberalism as well as the potential for using existing laws designed to protect property rights to challenge and ultimately subvert those rights. Second, I examine the current Brazilian government strategy to use free and open source software to promote technological autonomy and resist the economic power of the Global North in the information technology sector. Third, I focus on the efforts of the Brazilian Ministry of Culture, highlighting the possibilities for using cultural policy to forge alternatives to neoliberalism by making free software available as a global public good. This policy uses digital culture to foster new forms of collectivity and grassroots participation in social and cultural life, creating a foundation for innovative, alternative forms of globalization."
0,"Past research on environmental risk perceptions has documented what has come to be known as the “white male” effect, whereby white males are more accepting of a wide range of technological and environmental risks than are other adults.  Most scholars in this literature offer sociopolitical explanations for this phenomenon.  We extend this scholarship by focusing in depth on beliefs and attitudes about a pressing global environmental risk: climate change.  Building upon recent attempts to clarify sociopolitical explanations of the white male effect, we examine how the climate change beliefs and attitudes of conservative white males compare with those of other adults.  We find a significant influence of a “conservative white male” effect—using a three-way interaction term—on four dimensions of climate change denial: (a) knowledge about climate change; (b) belief about the scientific consensus; (c) concern about climate change; and (d) climate policy preferences.  Briefly, our “conservative white male” interaction term remained significant in most models explaining climate change denial, even controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, gender, and those of eight other relevant social, political, and demographic variables.  Conservative white males are a significant source of climate change denial in the American public."
0,"The changing marriage regime and the rise of individualized marriages have meant changes in all aspects of marriage, from when and if individuals marry to whom they marry and how they meet their partners. As the role and importance of marriage changes, so too does the criteria one uses to select a mate. In the post-second demographic transition era, the once-dominant social institutions that by choice or necessity dictated partner selection – race, religion, and geography – have changed dramatically in recent decades and social scientists are beginning to focus on what may be replacing these assortative mating criteria. This research uses matched partner data on approximately 1500 dating, married and cohabiting relationships and focuses on partners’ activities as matching criteria in marriage markets. First, I ask: how similar are partners in terms of activities? To do so, I investigate the activities on which couples are most likely to match. Next, I consider the strength of activity homogamy vis-à-vis more traditional types of homogamy (religion, race, parent education, and family structure). Finally, I look at how homogamy differs across relationship types, with an eye toward understanding if and how shared activities function differently at different levels of relationship commitment."
0,"It is often assumed that the religious culture of a state can shape policies within the state, particularly concerning morality issues such as abortion or homosexuality. However, the precise manner in which religion shapes these policies has not been clearly specified. Drawing from social movements and policy literature, we argue that the influence of a state's level of evangelical adherence is mediated through mechanisms such as interest groups, issue salience, popular opinion and the political composition of the state government. We assess this theoretical model using data on states' laws regarding sexual orientation. The analysis shows that, as expected, a state's level of evangelical adherence does not have a direct effect on its policies concerning sexual orientation. However, evangelical adherence does have an indirect influence on those policies through mediating mechanisms."
0,"This essay uses a deviant case analysis of the 1995-2000 Detroit newspaper strike to critique and revise theories of strike activity. As the formal institutions regulating industrial relations in the United States have declined, workplace struggles have expanded or reentered into other arenas of the state and civil society. In addition, the essay develops the methodological concept of a ""signal juncture,"" that is, moments of conflict that reveal a ""collision"" of underlying developmental paths. Unlike the more familiar concept of the critical juncture, a signal juncture reveals ongoing structural tensions and conflicting actors within otherwise continuous trends."
0,"Using ethnographic accounts of a series of performances given by 2 queer burlesque troupes, this paper explores the queer erotic representations of female-feminine bodies.  Specifically, I argue that the popularity of queer burlesque in queer communities coincides with the communitys avowal of a radical sex positive culture and that the use of queer feminine bodies achieves a particular kind of radical eroticism because of its use of the body and its reliance on the general cultural eroticization of the female body.  Through the erotic labor of queer feminine women in burlesque, which is sometimes paid and sometimes unpaid, the queer community benefits from a sexuality display that is public, visible, and unapologetic.  Queer burlesques radical potential lies in its critique that sex and politics are, or should be, separate.  In their performances they deliver concrete political messages (like queer people should practice safer sex methods), but they also deliver a more abstract political message (that queer sex for the sake of pleasure is valuable).  In this way, they are an embodiment of sex radical politics because they illustrate that sex does not subvert political goals and the political does not subvert the potential for pleasure."
0,"During his early sociological period (1896-1914), Du Bois published several empirically-based studies on the Black Church. Many topics were addressed that are relevant to the contemporary study of the Black Church and the sociology of religion. Du Bois utilized methodological triangulation to empirically ground his studies of the Black Church. Census, survey, and ethnographic data were integrated to provide a comprehensive picture of the role of the Black Church in the African American community. He addressed the social construction of African American religious identity and provided an early functional analysis of the Black Church. The association between religion and social class was recognized, and Du Bois was a pioneer in the area of congregational studies addressing such issues as church expenditures and membership patterns and generating surveys of children's religious beliefs and ministerial effectiveness. Extensive data were collected on Black Church membership in large cities and small communities. These data make it possible to reconstruct the Black Church religious economy in these areas. Du Bois' sociological work on religion provides a link to the discipline's past and a bridge to its future."
0,"This paper examines women’s marital power in the context of HIV testing in rural Malawi.  The data used are qualitative interviews (N=45) with married couples who had been offered HIV testing in their homes in the course of their participation in the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project, a population-based survey.  This paper explores how women strategize within the constraints of patriarchy to exercise their marital power when presented with the opportunity to be HIV tested.  Three sources of women’s marital power are identified.  First, the act of HIV testing and knowledge of serostatus empowers women in their marriages, and helps them persuade their husbands to get tested.  Second, the occasion of HIV testing gives women an opportunity to discuss infidelity – both directly and through references to the couple’s “shared fate”.  Finally, couple counseling levels the playing field between husband and wife by ensuring equal knowledge in the marriage."
0,"Drawing on archival analysis and in-depth interviews, this article examines Colombia's adoption of policies for black Colombians in 1993. It argues that Afro-Colombian activists were able to seize upon changes in global policy norms around multiculturalism and state disequilibrium both by deploying traditional social movement strategies and by framing their demands in terms of ethnic difference. This case extends our understanding of how social movements make strategic use of political openings and also illustrates the circumstances under which an ethnic difference framing can be a more effective political strategy for achieving rights for black populations than a racial equality framing."
0,"Building on Belsky's process model of the determinants of parenting and using a nationally representative dataset of U.S. adolescents, this article examines the relationship between parental satisfaction and parents' perceptions of their adolescents and their own personal and social resources. As such, it provides a coherent framework for understanding parental well-being during a critical stage of the family life course. The results suggest that parental satisfaction is negatively related to parents' perceptions that their adolescents are involved in problem behaviors or experiencing challenges in other domains of their lives; however, the relationship between parental satisfaction and adolescents' problem behaviors is mediated by parents' perceptions of their adolescents' characters, including whether or not they have a bad temper and their levels of trustworthiness. With respect to personal and social resources, parents' educational achievement and marital status are positively related to parental satisfaction, and the level of conflict in the spousal relationship is negatively related to parental satisfaction."
0,"Research has extensively examined matching on race and other characteristics in cohabitation and marriage, but it has generally disregarded sexual and romantic relationships. Using data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the tempo of key transitions in the recent relationships of young adults ages 18-24. We focus on how the racial mix of partners in relationships is associated with the timing of sex, cohabitation and marriage. We find evidence that relationships between white men and minority women proceed more rapidly from romance to sexual involvement and from sexual involvement to cohabitation compared to relationships involving other racial combinations. Our findings have important implications for social exchange perspectives on mate selection."
0,"As rates of self-employment and entrepreneurial activity grow in the U.S., sociologists are beginning to consider the causes and consequences of this form of employment more seriously. While the sociological contributions to entrepreneurial research take seriously the social context in which self-employment occurs, few studies focus explicitly on the effects of social and economic contexts on rates of self-employment in particular regions. I fill this gap by examining the effects of a variety of local labor-market, population, and economic characteristics on county-level self-employment rates in three predominantly rural states: Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. I find that counties with higher proportions of their labor forces in extractive industries and that have experienced greater declines in the primary sector had higher rates of poverty and unemployment; however, self-employment is negatively related to county-level poverty rates, indicating that self-employment may provide opportunities for those in rural counties undergoing economic transformations."
0,"Despite the centrality of gift giving and reciprocity in the national rhetoric and the self understanding of members, scholars have generally refrained from studying giving to the nation as a mechanism of nation building and instead treat willingness to sacrifice for the nation as merely a sign of already existing national attachments. While gift giving is widely acknowledged as a practice that creates social ties and obligation, in modern settings researchers often treat gift giving as an interpersonal matter, not relevant to the grander scale of the nation. This paper challenges this avoidance by examining the mechanism that the Zionist movement created to secure a stream of donations from their compatriots in the United States in the 1940s. Instead of treating philanthropic giving as a mere instrumentality or an outcome of primordial Jewish tradition, I treat charitable giving as practical accomplishment and a medium through which diaspora groups negotiate their position within the nation. My analysis focuses on the minute practices developed in order to procure donations examining how national movements create the obligation to give in the absence of counter gift. It shows that rather than simply emphasizing the unity of the nation as a means to loosen purse strings, national giving rests on a concomitant marking and blurring of the differences between homeland and diaspora groups. I use this observation to argue that internal differences are not merely an obstacle but can sometimes play a productive constitutive role in the process of nation building."

0,"In this article, the continuity in music taste from parents to their children is discussed via a multi-actor design. In our models music preferences of 325 adolescents and both their parents were linked, with parental and adolescent educational level as covariates. Parents' preferences for different types of music that had been popular when they were young were subsumed under the general labels of Pop, Rock and Highbrow. Current adolescent music preferences resolved into Pop, Rock, Highbrow and Dance. Among partners in a couple, tastes were similar; for both generations, education was linked to taste; and parental preferences predicted adolescent music choices. More specifically, the preference of fathers and mothers for Pop was associated with adolescent preferences for Pop and Dance. Parents' preferences for Rock seemed to indicate their daughters would also like Rock music, but not their sons. Parental passion for Highbrow music was associated with Highbrow preferences among their children. It is concluded that preferences for cultural artifacts such as (popular) music show continuity from generation to generation."
0,"In this paper, I use survey data from high school students in Texas to examine the magnitude of peer correlation in college preferences and choices. In this survey, respondents (and their classmates) recorded their preferences for attending specific colleges, and a follow up survey recorded their college enrollment decisions. This paper uses this information to present the first empirical examination of whether individuals who report preferences for ""popular"" colleges are more likely to attend their preferred college. The rich data set allows the use of often unavailable information such as distance to college, and the construction of the ""popularity"" variable allows the use of school-level fixed effects. Results indicate that individuals with 10 percentage points more classmates with matching college preferences are 3 percentage points more likely to enroll in their preferred college. "
0,"Research on the incidence and prevalence of HIV has focused exclusively on analyzing the presence of the disease at the individual level.  Despite the obvious benefits of this approach, there is an important need to understand the presence of HIV within organizations, including religious congregations, which could serve as sites of prevention programs and programs that provide treatment for those living with HIV.  In this paper, we estimate the proportion of religious congregations in which someone is HIV positive and the influence of congregational characteristics on the likelihood of having such person(s) using data from a nationally representative sample of U.S. religious congregations.  We find that a sizable number of congregations (4.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.7%-6.2%)) contain people who are HIV positive, and several factors correlate with that likelihood.  Policy initiatives should consider this information when determining whether to use congregations as sites of HIV services and programs."
0,"This paper presents a new theoretical framework for the study of environmental consumption at the micro-level by building on concepts from classical sociological theory and recent macro-level studies of the environment. The framework emphasizes the local community context as an important determinant of environmental consumption. We test this framework with unique Micro-level data on consumption, household size, household affluence, and community context from Nepal, a setting in the midst of dramatic change in community organization, population size, and consumption behavior. The results of these tests are consistent with the hypothesis that local non-family organizations shift the consumption of environmental resources from direct to more indirect. We argue that the framework presented here is a useful early step toward more comprehensive micro-level models of environmental quality. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"There is a gaping hole in the sociology of family about upper-income families, despite the fact that they are the group that has benefited most during the rise of the new economy.  This talk, based on interviews and ethnographic work with eleven upper-income families in Silicon Valley, is designed to close this gap.  My analysis of these families finds that their cultural and familial practices, which center on the themes of uniqueness and customization, mirror the underlying features of the new high-value economy, leading me to argue that these social practices and economic features are mutually constitutive.  I go on to argue that while most peoples economic security and sense of control is undermined by the volatile nature of the new-economy, upper-income families structural position enables them to retain their economic security and thus their sense of control.  Consequently, assumptions commonly held during the old economy continue to live on among upper-income families in the new economy, engendering psychic orientations and emotional senses of self, or structures of feeling, that form the basis of new class divisions in the twenty first century."
0,"This study examines how dynamics surrounding biographical disruptions compare to more routine fluctuations in personal social networks. Using data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, the authors track changes in patients' social networks over three years and compare them to a representative sample of persons with no self-reported mental illness. Overall, individuals at the onset of treatment report larger and more broadly functional social networks than individuals in the population at large. However, the number of network ties among the latter increases over time, whereas network size decreases slightly among people using mental health services. As individuals progress through treatment, less broadly supportive ties drop out of extended networks, but a core safety net remains relatively intact. The findings in this case provide evidence that social network dynamics reflect changing needs and resources: persons labeled with psychiatric disorders learn to manage illness, with functionality driving social interaction in times of biographical disruption."
0,"First proposed by Mueller, the theory of the ""rally effect"" predicts that public support for government officials will increase when an event occurs that (1) is international; (2) involves the United States; and (3) is specific, dramatic, and sharply focused [Mueller, J.E. 1973. War, Presidents, & Public Opinion. New York: John Wiley & Sons., p. 209]. Using the natural experiment of a large (N = 15,127) survey of young adults ages 18-27 that was in the field during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, we confirm the existence of a rally effect on trust in government as well as its subsequent decay. We then use a predictive modeling approach to investigate individual-level dynamics of rallying around the flag and anti-rallying in the face of the national threat. By disaggregating predictors of rallying, we demonstrate remarkably different patterns of response to the attacks based on sex and, particularly, race. The results confirm expectations of national threat inciting a rally effect, but indicate that the dynamics of this rally effect are complex and race and gender-dependent. The article offers previously-unavailable insights into the dynamics of rallying and trust in government. "
0,"Social relations of power and resistance are inscribed into living landscapes of farming, dwelling and cultivation. Claims to power are marked out by landscape features such as plazas, pathways, vantage points and significant trees, all of which proclaim use-rights, ownership or sacrality of particular places. Drawing on historical archives, literary sources and visual imagery from the Anglophone and Francophone Caribbean, this article develops a material-cultural approach to the political economy of trees in the Caribbean. Trees have been used to identify, symbolize, demarcate and sustain various Caribbean places, meanings and lives. The first section traces the importance of trees in the development of plantation economies and consolidation of empire -- from mahogany to palms and fruit trees. The second part explores the contestation of these arboreal landscapes by Afro-Caribbean agents who claimed particular trees for their own projects of survival and meaning-making -- sacred ancestral trees, liberty trees, family land trees. Drawing on histories of landscape, political economies of land use, and theories of the social production of space, the article suggests that there are multiple superimposed orderings of space evident in the historical and contemporary landscapes of Caribbean plantation societies. The conclusion offers some reflections on the 'cultural turn' in development studies and environmental studies, the overlooked role of material culture in Caribbean studies, and the importance of a multi-method approach to tracing social struggles over land, space and place."
0,"Latin America is often used as a backdrop against which U.S. race relations are compared. Yet research on race in Latin America focuses almost exclusively on countries in the region with a large recognized presence of individuals of African descent such as Brazil. Racial categories in these countries are based on skin color distinctions along a black-white continuum. By contrast, the main socially recognized ethnic distinction in Indo-Latin American countries such as Mexico, between indigenous and non-indigenous residents, is not based primarily on phenotypical differences, but rather on cultural practices and language use. Many Mexicans today nevertheless express a preference for whiter skin and European features, even though no clear system of skin color categorization appears to exist. In this study, I use data from a nationally-representative panel survey of Mexican adults to examine the extent of skin-color-based social stratification in contemporary Mexico. Despite extreme ambiguity in skin color classification, I find considerable agreement among survey interviewers about who belongs to three skin color categories. The results also provide evidence of profound social stratification by skin color. Individuals with darker skin tone have significantly lower levels of educational attainment and occupational status, and they are more likely to live in poverty and less likely to be affluent, even after controlling for other individual characteristics."
0,"Labor economic literature has demonstrated a consistent positive association between immigrants' earnings and their level of proficiency in the host society's language. Sociological literature, on the other hand, has explicated that immigrants' abilities to speak the host society's language are affected by structural/ecological factors which shape the linguistic environment of immigrants. This study proposes a logical extension of the two literatures by suggesting that structural /ecological factors affect immigrants' earnings indirectly by affecting their ability to speak the host society's language. Using individual and aggregate data from the U.S. Census 2000, we found that structural/ecological factors such as group size, segregation, and linguistic heterogeneity affected immigrants' earnings not only directly but also indirectly via their impacts on immigrants' English ability. English ability is a key mediator through which structural forces shape individual immigrant's economic assimilation outcome. Published by Elsevier Inc."
0,"A neighborhood's normative climate is linked to, but conceptually distinct from, its structural characteristics such as poverty and racial/ethnic composition. Given the deleterious consequences of early sexual activity for adolescent health and well-being, it is important to assess normative influences on youth behaviors such as sexual debut, number of sex partners, and involvement in casual sexual experiences. The current study moves beyond prior research by constructing a measure of normative climate that more fully captures neighborhood norms, and analyzing the influence of normative climate on behavior in a longitudinal framework. Using recently geo-coded data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS), we analyze the effect of normative climate on adolescents' sexual behaviors. Results indicate that variation in neighborhood normative climates increases adolescents' odds of sexual debut and casual sex, and is associated with their number of sex partners, even after accounting for neighborhood structural disadvantage and demographic risk factors.

0,"This paper examines the effect of employment-supportive policies and arrangements on women's economic contribution to their family. Using samples of working-age couples in 21 countries we employ multilevel modeling to separate the effects of household and country-level variables on earnings. We distinguish two types of relevant contextual factors: those that support women's employment while preserving their domestic roles and those that potentially reduce intra-family economic inequalities by allowing women to allocate more of their time to paid employment. The findings suggest that all employment-supportive policies and arrangements increase women's relative contribution to the household income through their effect on female labor force participation. Among dual-earner families, however, higher rates of childcare facilities increase women's contribution, while long maternity leave and part-time employment decrease it. These tendencies are more pronounced among mothers. "
0,"In the past decade, scholars have begun to turn their attention to social movements designed to encourage social responsibility within markets. However, existing literature on socially responsible markets tends to be bifurcated, focusing on either the structural or the cultural and interactional factors that shape the meanings and practices of social responsibility. In this paper, we propose an integrative approach that examines the situated nature of social responsibility, and how different structural, interactional, and cultural contexts shape these meanings in attempts to regulate corporations. Through examining a range of micro-level interactions across social certifications and socially responsible investments, we make two contributions to the study of culture and markets: 1) Social responsibility is a fluid concept whose meanings are shaped by the macro and micro-level contexts in which the term is discussed and, perhaps more importantly, 2) the market-based context of these social interactions has an inherently profit-oriented influence on the meaning of social responsibility. Our findings suggest that scholars seeking to understand the limits and possibilities of socially responsible markets must pay more attention to the link between micro- and macro-level theories of markets."
0,"In this paper, I discuss The Listening Guide, a feminist voice-centered method of analysis that allows for the investigation of social discourses and individual meaning making (or voice) in qualitative interview data.  Highlighting central insights of the method, I illustrate its workings by drawing on interview data with 58 African American women concerning their understandings of gender and the particular image of the strong Black woman.  In the process, I demonstrate that the Guides distinctions between and its focused attention to discourse and voice provide for a productive, textured reading of structure and agency in individuals lives.   I conclude the paper with a brief discussion of the studys findings with respect to the ways in which Black women are brought into line with, resist, and reformulate collective understandings about their reputed strength."
0,"We test competing hypotheses from political-economic and neo-liberal theories about the effects of economic growth and urbanization on a neglected, but important, indicator of environmental health: aquatic biodiversity. We analyze cross-national data on the number of threatened fish species within national territorial waters using negative binomial regression. We find that, counter to the expectations of neo-liberal theories, economic growth increases the likelihood of fish species becoming threatened within nations. Urbanization, however, appears to have no additional effect. The ""environmental Kuznets curve"" does not hold for aquatic biodiversity, suggesting that further economic growth in nations is likely to escalate the biodiversity crisis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"This paper is based on an evaluation of an Early Reading First Literacy program funded by the U.S. Department of Education and implemented by a community-based organization in Central Texas, Community Action, Inc.  The program provided professional training and mentoring to early childhood teachers to enhance literacy resources in Head Start classrooms serving primarily Mexican American children. Fourteen classrooms were observed over a three-year period. Data from ELLCO, ECERS and C.I.R.C.L. E. assessments show that mentoring was an effective change strategy in improving literacy education.  Teachers scores on all standardized assessments significantly increased. Focus groups and individual interviews explore the benefits and weaknesses of the mentoring program implemented."
0,"One of the aims of this paper is to encourage us to think critically about the distinctive character of the early tradition of American sociological thought. European thinkers were preoccupied with the prospects of the liberation of the individual subsumed under modern institutional constraints. The authors of the early American sociological tradition emphasize the primacy of societal forces over individual freedom in directing changes they observe in society. In this paper I examine how the authors of the early American tradition question to what extent people are free to make their own moral choices under the constraints of acting according to laws of the common good, and to what extent modern institutions encompass the possibility of expressive freedom and development of individual autonomy."
0,"This project investigates the cultural logic behind the exclusionary and inclusionary party politics toward foreign spouses’ marriage incorporation in Taiwan. Utilizing a public online database of the Taiwan Legislative Yuan, I perform a discourse analysis of the legislative interrogations and responses on “foreign spouses” in the Legislative Yuan Bulletin from 2000 to 2004, since Taiwan’s regime change, to examine whether there is a party-divide in immigration inclusionary and exclusionary attitudes, and what is the cultural logic behind this divide. The parties examined are the Democratic Progressive Party, Kuomingtang, and other derivative parties. The Democratic Progressive Party is believed to be more pro-independence and separatist while the Kuomingtang has the tendency to be pro-unification with the mainland China. Thus, different party’s treatment of the two largest categories of foreign spouses, namely the Southeast Asian and the mainland Chinese spouses, could shed light on our understanding of the cultural logic behind different visions of nationalism. This paper argues that immigration policy is highly influenced by the cultural script of diverged forms of nationalism inscribed in different political parties."
0,"Policy reforms and rising income inequality transformed educational and economic opportunities for Americans approaching midlife in the 1990s. Rising income inequality may have reduced mobility, as income gaps increased between rich and poor children. Against the effects of rising inequality, Civil Rights reforms may have increased mobility, as opportunities expanded across cohorts of black students and workers. We compare educational and income mobility for two cohorts of black and white men, the older born in the late 1940s and the younger born in the early 1960s. We find that educational mobility increased for black men, but income mobility declined for both races. Economic mobility declined despite unchanged or improved educational mobility because of increased returns to schooling and increased intergenerational income correlations, independent of schooling."
0,"I used NELS:88, a nationally representative sample of eighth grade students, their parents, teachers and other school personnel and the context within which they attend school. I looked at the role of the school as a social institution and examined factors that contribute to a cooperative, orderly and structured learning environment regardless of the students characteristics that might offset or promote their learning (e.g. their socioeconomic status). With other things equal, I found that a structured school climate has a significant and positive effect on the schools mathematics, science, and reading achievement tests. A school with positive learning environment and strong leadership promotes better learning for its students, whom I refer to this type of school, a school with high degree of social capital. I also found that with other things equal, schools with systematic outreach effort to involve parents, demonstrate high levels of overall school mathematics achievement while parental involvement initiated primarily by parents themselves does not show any significant result when other factors are taken into account. For reading and science test scores, I did not find the same significant effect. Perhaps it is more important for schools to systematically involve parents in earlier grades."
0,"Several scholars claim that group cohesion among black Americans is necessary for black advancement. Our research examines the extent to which group cohesion is possible given the increasing diversity of Black America, particularly with regard to race and class. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 33 middle-class blacks and 40 black-white biracials, we explore (1) the similarities and differences in the experiences of both groups, (2) their encounters with marginalization, (3) how they negotiate perceived marginalization, and (4) the extent to which all of the above are shaped by socially constructed ideas of blackness. We find that narrow notions of oauthentico blackness challenge group cohesion and threaten to splinter the black community along class and ethnic/racial lines. However, we find evidence of greater tolerance for the community's racial diversity than its class diversity. Nevertheless, the data presented here suggest that the increasing heterogeneity of Black America poses significant challenges to group cohesion."
0,"Several studies examine biblical literalism to categorize Christian denominations and predict attitudes and behaviors. Yet, few studies have identified the predictors of literalist orientations. In this study, we use structuration theory and gender theory to develop hypotheses concerning gender differences in literalist ideologies based on the degree of organizational patriarchy among religious traditions. Analyses using two national data sets demonstrate that women are relatively more inclined than men to embrace a literalist ideology in patriarchal religious organizations than in mainline organizations. We argue that a literalist ideology provides a compensatory schema to conservative Protestant women, who are generally denied access to organizational resources, especially positions of leadership and authority, in such organizations. We conclude by identifying the implications of our findings for research on gender, religion and patriarchal organizations."
0,"Asian Americans are one the fastest growing nonwhite populations and nearly half are Christian. Little is known, however, about the impact of religion on their civic lives beyond volunteerism. This article is a comparative analysis of Asian American Catholic and Protestant civic involvements. In the general population some have argued that the acquisition of civic skills is hindered by Catholic affiliation relative to Protestantism, but it is not know if the same is true for Asian Americans. I explore these issues with data from the Social Capital Benchmark (SCCB) Survey using logistic regression analysis. Results suggest that Protestant Asian Americans are more likely to vote and be interested in politics than Asian American Catholics, but being Protestant is not a significant predictor of community participation. I conclude that religion, particularly with small group participation, is an important resource for all Asian American Christians across broad measures of civic life."
0,"How do humans interact with animals in public, and what is the significance of such encounters?  While some scholars have paid attention to intimate relationships between guardians and their companion animals, few studies have examined the other ways that animals are part of society.  Participant observation in a park located in Greenwich Village, New York demonstrates that it is common for humans to seek enjoyable interactions with street pigeons.  In unpacking the how of such interactions in a public park, this seemingly mundane finding reveals that, with pigeons, human visitors to the park obtain a unique form of playful, carefree, face-to-face interaction heretofore only documented among humans by urban ethnographers and Simmel (1971), who described such interactions with the concept of sociability.  An ethnomethodological sensibility, in which shared understanding is dropped as a prerequisite for coordinated interaction, paves the way for a needed amendment of sociability to include interactions among humans and animals.  Logically, such an amendment also forces- and relies upon- an extension of the interaction order (Goffman 1983) to include animals.  This study thus sheds light on the ways in which even minor interactions with simple animals have significance for human beings that require rethinking sociological theory."
0,"What sense does it make to try to reform urban schools while the communities around them stagnate or collapse? Conversely, can community building and development efforts succeed in revitalizing inner city neighborhoods if the public schools within them continue to fail their students? The fates of urban schools and communities are linked, yet school reformers and community builders typically act as if they are not. More recently, a wide range of initiatives has emerged that seek to forge collaborations between community-based organizations and schools. In this article I will elaborate an argument for a new, community-oriented, approach to education reform. I outline a conceptual approach to understanding school-community collaboration and develop a typology of the major approaches linking community organizations to school improvement that have emerged in the United States. Drawing upon my own and others fieldwork, I illustrate the different types of school-community collaborations with key examples. I conclude the article with a discussion of the possibilities of a new approach to education reform that links it theoretically and practically to social change in our nations cities."
0,"This article examines the mutability of symbolic sanctions or stigmas - applied to sex industry work by examining newspaper narratives in one medium-sized Canadian city over two time periods: 1870 - 1910 and 1980 - 2004. The article's purpose is first to get a sense of what the authors call the ecology of stigmas - their relation to the temporal and spatial contexts in which they are produced - and second to give needed historical context to them and the representational tropes that currently dominate media, policy, and academic discussions about prostitution. This article finds significant continuities and discontinuities between media representations during the two study periods. In particular, prostitution stigmas are constituted out of cross-articulations of narratives around containment, culpability, and contagion across the twentieth century, but the ideational contents and empirical referents of these narratives reflect the intersection of sex industry contexts with historically specific concerns around gender, sexuality, race, and social status. Stigmas of the sex industry, rather than being constant, reveal themselves to be both deeply ecological and accommodating to a range of concerns about female sexuality and normative behavior that are sensitive to historical time."
0,"This is a comparative case study of two groups of workers about how they try to resolve the labor contentions through different ways.  Through detailed comparison, I attempt to explain how the different positioning in the gender-race-class nexus of the state socialism and the different historical trajectory of vicissitude in the social reform, will influence different groups of workers choices from their contentious repertoires  office petition, court prosecution and street protest.  I will argue that the inferior position of the female temporary workers will push them to the way of legal struggle for formal equality, while the experiences of work-units send the male state workers to the administrative channel for compensation.  However, the fragmented mentality and historical cleavages among the workers made a large scale labors movement based on universal class identity and interest impossible.  And the state thus could maintain its control through dispersive containment of social conflict."
0,"Drawing on insights from the organizational, education, and culture subfields of sociology, I attempt in this paper to make sense of Warren Village, a transitional housing site in Denver, Colorado.  I explore how this intermediary non-profit organization refracts bureaucratic welfare state policiesas well as broader cultural models about education and opportunityinto its local organizational setting. In addition to examining how and why the organization incorporates certain cultural forms into its day-to-day activities, I also have two other goals in mind: to examine how these decisions affect the lives of the organizations clientelehomeless, single parents and their childrenand to see if there are any major policy insights to be drawn from the site.  In this piece of the larger project, I specifically am looking at the role that educational activities play in the organizational structure of Warren Village."
0,"This research investigates the merits of the ""social causation"" and ""health selection"" explanations for associations between socioeconomic status and self-reported overall health, musculoskeletal health and depression. Using data that include information about individuals' SES and health from childhood through late adulthood, I employ structural equation models that account for errors in measured variables and that allow for explicit tests Of various hypotheses about how SES and health are related. For each outcome and for both women and men the results provide no support for the health selection hypothesis. SES affects each health outcome at multiple points in the life course, but the reverse is not true."
0,"The perception of mattering, defined as one's perceived significance to others, is likely influenced by the interpersonal and intrapersonal dimensions of religious faith. Using data from a community study conducted in Miami-Dade County, this study examines whether private and public aspects of religiosity are independently as well as mutually associated with perceptions of mattering, net of secular social resources. We also consider whether the availability of religious and secular resources varies by race/ethnicity, and whether such differences account for race/ethnic differences in perceptions of mattering. Findings demonstrate that private religiosity and membership in a religious organization, in addition to secular social support and integration, are independently associated with perceptions of mattering. Findings also reveal that, compared to Whites, the higher levels of mattering reported by African Americans are largely explained by their higher levels of private religiosity and greater likelihood of belonging to religious organizations and attending religious services."
0,"Numerous factors influence health, including family background, individual behaviors, and community context. Access to care and insurance are critical, especially for people in lower socioeconomic groups who often face challenges beyond their immediate control. Building from a synthesis of theoretical frameworks, and using data from the Delta Rural Poll, this article utilizes logistic regression to explore the relationship between macro and micro socioeconomic resources and self-rated health among residents of the Mississippi Delta. Results demonstrate that these are important factors, although associations vary by racial group. Theory and policy considerations arising from the results are discussed."
0,"While Wallerstein’s world-systems analysis builds on Marx in many regards, Wallerstein has come under critique by Marxists who claim his analysis neglects factors central to that of Marx, most importantly, the primacy of class relations. This paper will first examine Wallerstein’s own positioning of himself in relation to Marx before considering the claims of his critics. Are his deviations from Marx a significant weakness in his analysis, or are they merely due to having the advantage of historical hindsight? Are they rooted in empirical evidence regarding how the world has changed since Marx’s writing? Or have Wallerstein’s critics identified significant weaknesses in his theory that ought to be addressed to aid our understanding of the present world-system? After reviewing the debate regarding the appropriate unit of analysis and the role of class vs. exchange relations, this paper concludes that Wallerstein is correct in asserting that the world-system rather than the state should be the unit of analysis. While he is also correct in asserting that class cannot always be defined in terms of production relations, in the case of our modern world-system, that is often the most defining characteristic. Economic exchange relations play a central role in the formation of classes, but it should not be an either/or debate between exchange relations and the relations of production. The order of causation is the main issue of contention, but socio-productive relations and exchange relations are constantly exerting influence on one another."
0,"The impact of school bureaucracy has been recognized over time as critical to understanding how schools work and assessing the capacity of public schools to educate the populace (Bidwell 2001; Rogers and Chung, 1983; Payne, 2008; Rogers, 2009).  In addition, important recent work has focused on the critical role of middle class parental involvement in school reform and improvement (Kahlenberg 2001; 2007).  We use data from a single case study of a high performing school in a low performing urban district to explore the role of bureaucracy in shaping middle class parents interactions with the school.   We find that middle class parents were unable to effectively activate their resources to effect change.  Our findings suggest limits to the power of middle class parents to effectively activate their social and cultural capital.  Our work also calls into question the assumptions of advocates for school choice as an effective mechanism for promoting urban school reform."
0,"In this paper, the question which macro-sociological explanations for the occurrence of supporters violence are valid is posed. By conceptualizing supporters violence as a form of collective violence, four possible explanations are proposed: unemployment, media attention, repression and aggressive play on the pitch. These explanations are tested for the occurrence of violence around soccer matches in the Netherlands during the period 2001-2005. We employ a Generalized Event Count model and demonstrate that media attention and aggressive play on the pith are significant explanatory factors for the occurrence of violence, while general levels of unemployment and police repression do not have a significant impact. These results do not validate the call for more police intervention, but instead point to the responsibility of both soccer players and journalists in fostering supporters violence."
0,"Do attaining similar levels of job authority in white collar employment equally insulate White, African American, and Latino men from perceived job insecurity?  Findings from the 2006 General Social Survey support the marginalized-work perspective, which maintains that across authority levels, employment practices associated with “modern prejudice” produce a racialized continuum in the incidence and determinants of perceived insecurity.  Specifically, Whites experience the lowest level of perceived insecurity and are susceptible to it on a relatively narrow and circumscribed basis, i.e., it is most structured by traditional stratification-based factors including human capital credentials, background socioeconomic status, and job/labor market characteristics; African Americans experience the highest level of perceived insecurity and are susceptible to it on the most broad and generalized basis, i.e.,  it is least structured by traditional stratification-based factors, and, along both issues, Latinos occupy an intermediate ground. Further, gaps in these dynamics of perceived insecurity—particularly between Whites and the two minority groups—are greater at successively higher levels of authority."
0,"It is commonly argued that social mobility rates are influenced by economic and political conditions. Nevertheless, research on this issue has tended to be hindered by two limitations that make it difficult to draw strong conclusions about contextual effects: (1) seldom have country-level and individual-level influences been tested simultaneously, and (2) only rarely have data more recent than the 1970s been employed. We improve on previous research by employing multilevel models fitted to relatively recent survey data collected from 20 modern societies by the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and national-level characteristics derived from various official sources. Our findings demonstrate systematic cross-national variation in the association between the occupational status of respondents and their fathers. Consistent with the industrialization thesis, this variation is positively associated with per-capita GDP, suggesting that more affluent nations are characterized by more open and fluid stratification structures. Our results also suggest the importance of political regimes and migration for social mobility. In contrast, economic inequality appears to explain very little of the cross-national variation in mobility rates. "
0,"Nation-building projects in Southeast Asia provide an unique opportunity to fully examine how globalizing forces in the form of immigration, communication, information, and technological flow affect the internal structure of state-society relations, which are often framed by a specific post-colonial experience. In Singapore, discursive practices have become a highly contested space for national representation and identity politics. While it might be tempting to only think of the state as the primary actor in nation-building projects, Singapores experience indicates otherwise; it involves a complex set of socio-political negotiations and economic interactions between social groups, including the development of a viable civil society and the multiple forms in which that takes place.This paper examines the unique sphere of cultural political expression where the language and representation take new forms as the states nation-building project continues paving new ways of weaving together colonialization and globalization narratives."
0,"Over the last decade, neoliberal welfare policies expanded nonprofit organizations' role in the welfare state. This change resulted in the organizational emergence of numerous ""welfare internships"" (i.e., situations where welfare recipients engage in work experiences to fulfill work requirements for little or no pay), whose existence and impacts have been understudied. Using qualitative interviews with nonprofit directors, this article explores the bureaucratic face of neoliberal welfare policies through detailing how two types of welfare internships (""intermediary internships"" and ""client internships"") develop, the motivations behind them, and the problems they present. This article examines the relevance of these impacts for the welfare-to-work and nonstandard employment literatures and describes potential implications for policymakers."
0,"Because of a lack of data, the locational attainment literature has not incorporated documentation status into models examining group differences in neighborhood quality. I fill this void by using the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, which permits the identification of undocumented respondents, allowing a reexamination of the ethnic structure of locational attainment in this important immigrant-receiving city. Results first suggest that while undocumented Latinos live in the poorest quality communities, blacks live in neighborhoods that are similar to native-born Latinos and better than foreign-born Asians and Latinos. Second, the effects of education are strongest for blacks, allowing the highly educated an opportunity to reside in communities that are of better quality than educated Latinos and Asians. Thus, undocumented Latinos replace blacks at the bottom of the locational attainment hierarchy, allowing educated blacks in Los Angeles to reside in better neighborhoods than blacks in the nation at large.

0,"Using the ASOC national telephone probability sample collected in 1995, 1998, and 2001, this study examines the effects of duration and dynamic patterns of work status on individuals mental health trajectories over time. One main aim is to examine the health divergence over the life course (cumulative advantage hypothesis) by work status measured by fulfillment and complexity of paid/unpaid primary daily activity. This study considers work status as a fundamental cause or structural condition proximal to SES and takes into account depression and anxiety to examine the health inequality in aging. Latent growth curve modeling and graphing \\\""aging vectors\\\"" deal with issues of mortality selection and confounding problem between aging process and cohort difference, which were the limitations of previous studies. Moreover, this aging-vector approach might be an alternative to study entire life-course pattern with using relatively short-term longitudinal data. In findings, persistence in work status plays important role in increasing health inequality in aging process, and rising work status gains additional benefit in mental health in spite of the lower initial work status. Higher work status as a structural condition has cumulative advantage across all the life stages, generating later-life divergence in mental health."
0,"The impact of Hurricane Katrina was especially dramatic in New Orleans, where catastrophic flooding threatened the lives of thousands of residents who did not or could not evacuate before the storm. To explain the large number of residents who did not evacuate in time, some commentators blame a lack of government aid and assistance for the poor while others fault an excessive dependence of the poor on government. Welfare dependency theorists, in particular, contend that a dependency-induced ""mentality of helplessness"" was prevalent among New Orleans' poor and helps to account for the incomplete evacuation. To gauge the plausibility of this argument, I use data from a unique survey to examine the characteristics of New Orleanians who were trapped in the flooded city. The findings indicate that, contrary to the expectations of welfare dependency theorists, more than half of the New Orleanians in question were employed full time before the storm and most displayed initiative after the disaster. Furthermore, in multivariate analyses, characteristics highlighted by dependency theorists did not predict the odds of pre-storm evacuation. Other explanations for the incomplete evacuation are explored."

Whats the influence of this travel on Mausswork and the diffusion of his work in USA?  The « Mauss » case is interesting because there is a  contact between scholars of the different disciplines, intellectual orientations and academic status.. Central to this study is the question of the international scientific relations : what is the role of Marcel Mauss during the 1920s? Ambassador or researcher ?"
0,"Why are some nations more religious than others? This article proposes a multilevel framework in which country differences in religious attendance are explained by contextual, individual, and cross-level interaction effects. Hypotheses from different theories are simultaneously tested with data from 60 nations obtained from the European/World Values Surveys. Multilevel logistic regression analyses show that religious regulation in a country diminishes religious attendance and that there are only small negative effects of people's own education and average educational level of the country. Religious attendance is strongly affected by personal and societal insecurities and by parental and national religious socialization and level of urbanization. These theories explain 75% of the cross-national variation in religious attendance."
0,"The Caribbean  both as an entire region and as a set of specific states and territories  is being re-spatialized, re-scaled and re-localized in the face of contemporary processes of neo-liberal development and global mobility. Drawing on the sociology of mobility, this paper argues that changes in the technologies and infrastructures of mobility, the discourses and cultural practices of travel, and the economic and political governance of development are contributing to the re-scaling and re-spatialization of the Caribbean. New spatial models are needed to describe the complex, polymorphic, and multiscalar geographies that constitute neo-liberalism in the urban, national, intraregional, and transnational spaces of the Caribbean. The first section offers an overview of new spatializations of Caribbean mobilities, including the liberalization of once publicly owned infrastructures of ports, airports, and telecommunications, through which tourism destinations are ever more tightly coupled with urban metropoles outside the region. The second section focuses on infrastructural developments in airports, the cruise industry, and luxury resorts that are re-making places for tourism; and the final section presents a case study of architect Zaha Hadids masterplan for a new resort on Dellis Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is shown how neo-modernist architectural theory and design strategies are playing a prominent part in new tourism developments in the region, closely linked to efforts at product differentiation, niche marketing, and spatial exclusivity."
0,"Students' social psychological adjustment to school is an important determinant of achievement growth as well as school continuation and post-secondary educational attainment. Yet many students begin high school with low levels of efficacy and self-worth, and low levels of identification with and liking of school. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that vocational education in high school provides disengaged students with an educational clean slate, leading to a recovery of engagement for at-risk students. Using propensity score models, we assess the relationship between vocational course taking and changes in effort, extracurricular participation, sense of belonging, interest in school, attitudes toward school and teachers, educational expectations, career aspirations, locus of control, and self-concept with the NELS:88 database.

0,"This paper seeks to explain the puzzling continuation of the dollar hegemony ever since the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary order in 1971. I argue that the status of the dollar, a fiat currency after 1971, as the most prominent currency in foreign exchange reserves and international transaction has been grounded on US political-military supremacy, which Washington employed effectively to preclude the rise of viable alternative currency. The lack of alternative to the dollar enabled the US to unilaterally manipulate the dollar’s value to meet the demand of its domestic economy, slowing its economic decline and maintaining the global confidence in the dollar in the last four decades. The recent economic rise of China, which has become a significant geopolitical player outside the US-centered global security umbrella originating in the Cold War, together with US’s escalating current account deficit with it, has been reducing US’s capacity in maintaining the dollar hegemony through unilateral manipulation of world currency values. The ongoing monetary conflict between the US and China will be of systemic significance, as its resolution will determine the future of the dollar’s global hegemony in the decades to come."
0,"This article uses time-series data from 1900 to 2005 to explore the effects of rivalry between labor unions as a special case of inter-organizational competition. Holding constant economic and political factors that typically account for changes in union density, we investigate how competition from rival labor federations and from independent unions affect both union density and a measure for the density of the dominant federation (AFL/AFL-CIO), adjusted for membership changes from mergers and splits. We measure competition by the number of unions and the size of rivals. While much existing literature measures state regulation with categorical coding for specific periods, we measure the effect of state enforcement directly with counts of pro-labor and pro-management unfair labor practice cases adjudicated by the National Labor Relations Board. We assess the effect of left-wing political culture using the popular vote for socialist and communist candidates in presidential elections. Both the number of members in rival unions and the total number of rival unions positively impact the rate of change in overall union density and in AFL density. The size of independent unions has a negative impact on AFL/AFL-CIO density but no effect on overall union density. Unfair labor practices cases adjudicated for employers negatively affect union density but positively affect AFL/AFL-CIO density, while cases adjudicated for unions negatively affect AFL/AFL-CIO density."
0,"The movie Carrie contains elements of the male gaze and abjection. The male gaze is the belief that when looking at blockbuster movies one can find examples of the sexual imbalance that exists in our society. Abjection refers to something which disturbs identity, systems, and order and does not respect borders, positions, and rules. Both the male gaze and abjection devalue women. The male gaze demotes the women to the role of a sexual object while making the men the hero. Abjection devalues women because the role of the woman is considered to be abject.  Elements of the male gaze and abjection are found throughout Carrie in the way the movie characterizes the female characters, and the overall message it sends about female sexuality and power."

0,"Using data collected from 5,118 Match.com Internet dating profiles, the authors conduct the first analysis of lesbians’ dating preferences, and offer a unique comparison between the preferences of lesbians and gay men. In addition to theories of assimilation, race, and intersectionality used in previous dating research, this study draws on an underutilized dimension of theories of hegemonic masculinity and femininity – namely, how these theories inform racialized, gendered ideals – to examine whether and why lesbians and gay men exclude potential dates by race-ethnicity. We find that gay men more readily conform to tenets of hegemonic masculinity than do lesbians to hegemonic femininity. Both gay men of color and lesbians of color exhibit higher rates of exclusion of one’s own race-ethnicity than do whites, however minority gay men have much higher rates of self-exclusion and prefer whites more. Lesbians of color are less likely to prefer whites than gay men of color, and are more likely than gay men to date their own racial-ethnic group and date any racial-ethnic group. Qualitative findings indicate that among the most self-exclusionary groups – blacks and Asians – these daters exclude their own racial-ethnic group when their profiles discuss ideal masculinities and femininities. While the quantitative findings show that the magnitude of the exclusion is much greater among gay men, qualitative analyses reveal that such exclusions are motivated by both racialized and gendered ideals for partners."
0,"University campuses experienced a surge in protest activity around labor issues during the late 1990s, highlighted by several high-profile graduate employee unionization campaigns. Some scholars and activists attribute these developments to notable changes in the academy, while others note that this wave of activity coincided with revitalization efforts by the broader U. S. labor movement that included reaching out to new constituencies and college students in particular. The authors advance this discussion by analyzing the factors leading to graduate employee union organizing campaigns between 1996 and 2001. They draw from social movement and labor research to suggest how shifts in the nature of academic labor markets, local resources and opportunities for activism, and increased links between organized labor and college campuses influence the timing and location of organizing campaigns. Results from an event history analysis of campaign activity largely support these claims and highlight the importance of local resources and opportunities for campus organizing."

In a sample of 583 retail food workers who regularly work nights and rotating schedules, women reported significantly more sleep disruption than men in multivariate models with extensive controls for demographics and work and family obligations.  A decomposition analysis showed that almost one-half of the gender gap in sleep disruption could be explained by gender differences in health, and work and family situations, suggesting that the remainder was attributable to gender differences in reacting to waking obligations and responsibilities.  Given the need for more research on how work-family conflict affects health and well-being, further research on sleep patterns is warranted."
0,"Previous studies on educational stratification in socialist China focused on how changing macropolitical processes and state policies affected the patterns of educational attainment, while paying less attention at the mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of educational inequality. Employing the cultural capital perspective, this article explores the relationship between cultural capital and children's educational attainment in urban China during the entire history of communist rule from 1949 to 1996. Using data from a nationally representative sample of Chinese urban adults conducted in 1996, this article addresses important issues about the social reproduction of educational inequalities in a socialist context. It finds that cultural capital has significant positive effects on children's educational attainment even after controlling for measures of family background. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that both the cultural reproduction model and the cultural mobility model have applicability to the Chinese case. Another finding is that the effects of cultural capital on educational attainment vary with the changing macropolitical processes in different historical periods in China. The results imply that the process of social stratification in socialist China has been shaped by massive state intervention."
0,"This paper reassesses Tannenbaums thesis on the differences between North American and Latin American race relations by looking to the colonial period for the origins of modern racial categories and by placing the development of free labor and ideologies of whiteness at the center of analysis.  Focusing on Virginia and Cuba, the study examines how colonial legal and social regulations, particularly those surrounding labor and sexual relations, generated distinctive systems of social stratification and novel conceptions of race in the two colonies. These disparate approaches to labor and racial classification in the colonial period shaped nineteenth century transformations in the labor regime and nation-building in Cuba and the US more broadly, as the dismantling of slavery, the rise of wage labor, and increased immigration altered discourses of race and nation. The paper argues that the way in which colonial Virginia and Cuba solved their labor problems fundamentally shaped their constructions of racial categories.  It concludes that the absence of a cross-class racial contract comparable to the one scholars like Edmund Morgan and Charles Mills have identified with the US is key to the disparate racial economies of Anglo and Iberian America."
0,"In this paper, I analyze Finnish and French local activists’ ideas of citizenship in a historically comparative perspective. I suggest that accounts of passive and active citizens, highlighted in debate concerning the current deficiencies of representative democracy, remain abstractions that fail to grasp the deeply contextual nature of the notion of citizenship. Instead, treating citizenship rather as a situated notion enables interpretations that can better reach the context-specific meanings the concept has to its subjects. I illustrate this argument by means of a comparative fieldwork and an analysis of Finnish and French activists’ interviews (N=48). The analysis shows that the Finnish activists held citizenship as a highly positive notion that stressed their belonging to, and the integration of, the society, as well as described well their own active societal role. On the contrary, the French activists saw citizenship as a problematic, state-defined concept that highlighted the current inequalities of the French society. The results of the analysis suggest that taking a minimally delimited notion of citizenship as a starting point enables sensitive, contextual analysis of the concrete developments of citizenship, instead of remaining at a level of general abstractions prone to purpose-oriented political uses."
0,"This paper represents the first installment of a book (currently 30,000 words) on Marshall Robin Ledbetter, Jr. (1969-2003), a college student who staged a peculiar “assault” on the Florida State Capitol in downtown Tallahassee during the early hours of June 14, 1991.  The book will examine the causes of Ledbetter’s deviant behavior, the events leading up to the crime, how the crime took place, how Ledbetter was apprehended, the charges levied against him, his psychological evaluations and judgments of the court, Ledbetter’s punishment and involuntary institutionalization,  and also Ledbetter’s reentry into society after his release.  An interesting Southern folktale in its own right, Ledbetter’s story offers a fascinating case study of the complex ways that society manages deviant people in real world situations. It provides insight into social confrontations with institutional power, how psychiatric labels become applied to social action, and the dominance of the medical model as explanation in explaining deviance. The case of Marshall Ledbetter should appeal to people interested in local Florida history, as well as social scientists and other readers interested in dynamics of deviance and social control in the American South.  This paper/presentation is intended to whet the appetite of the audience so that they will want to read the book."
0,"Multiracials have the flexibility to opt out of multiracial identity, to shift identities depending on context, and are characterized by in-group diversity. Given this fluid space, how do multiracials come to see themselves as a collective? This article describes an empirical example of collectivization processes at work. Specifically, the author observed the process of collective identity-building through ethnographic research in a mixed-race student-run organization. This case study indicates that group identity formation is a negotiated process involving strategies to achieve a sense of belonging and cohesion. The author shows that over time, by using experiences of social conflict to construct shared experiences, the members of this mixed-race organization developed collective identity. In so doing, their experience underscores how collective identity development is socially constructed and how micropractices are essential components of group formation."
0,National context may influence sex segregation of household tasks through both pragmatic decision making and the normative context in which decision making is embedded. This study utilizes 36 time use surveys from 19 countries (spanning 1965-2003) combined with original national-level data in multilevel models to examine household task segregation. Analyses reveal that men do less and women do more time-inflexible housework in nations where work hours and parental leave are long. Women do less of this work where there is more public child care and men are eligible to take parental leave. National context affects the character of gender inequality in the home through individual- and national-level pathways.
0,"This paper is part of a larger, on-going research project which addresses the intersection of popular culture and identity within the process of reading. The author considers several theories which inform her work on the intersection of culture, identity, and reading. Empirical research on comic book readers prompted further analysis of the ways that images and the stories within which they came to life intersected with sociological categories such as race, class, and gender. Prior work done in the field of Cultural Studies, with its focus on people's everyday lives, proved to be one of the better models for studying comic books and readers in a way that considered both the construction of meaning in everyday lives and the significance of social and individual identities within such constructions. The process of reading was ideal for the exploration of concepts of identity within theories of popular culture; theories that attempt to define what it is to be popular' or of the people'. This paper sets the groundwork for an analysis of relationships between historical definitions of popular culture, the cultural artifactual character of texts - specifically comic books, and the construction and maintenance of social identities linked to popular culture. A brief review of the debates within the studies of culture and over the term 'popular' highlight the importance of attempting to study a cultural process such as reading."
0,"This study draws on the literature on political opportunity structures to investigate the effects of local and national factors on the Zapatista cycle of protest from 1994 to 2003. A cross-sectional, timeseries, negative binomial model for event counts is used to analyze the ebb and flow of Zapatista protests across the 111 municipios ( municipalities) of Chiapas during this 10-year period. The results show that while all types of demands appear to have been significant triggers of protest activity, Zapatistas concentrated their protest events in larger and more closed localities that had a history of protest activity, stable elite alignments, and a larger military presence. Openings in the political system at the local and national levels lessened protest activity in the more democratic scenarios. These results suggest that the curvilinear relationship between the structure of political opportunities and protest mobilization posited to explain social movements in well-developed Western democracies does not explain the development of the protest cycle of a new social movement in an emerging electoral democracy."
0,"In the United States, criminal disenfranchisement is the only aspect of suffrage that continues to contract rather than expand.  Given our ever-swelling rate of incarceration and current prison population disproportionately comprised of racial minorities, the effects of reduced political participation necessarily negatively echo in other spheres of the minority social experience.  Furthermore, because voting restrictions for individuals subjected to criminal justice supervision emerged as a feature of a historically discriminatory and elitist agenda, data illustrate that although grafted from era since past, the energy motivating the enactment of the statutes persists today.  The aims of this research are to expose the historicity animating felon disenfranchisement legislation, examine the racialization of punishment and demographics of our current prison population, measure minority electoral participation in light of imposed restrictions on political agency and redress the issue of political impotence by offering solutions for a more inclusive sociopolitical agenda."
0,"Environmental justice scholars have suggested that because chemical plants and other hazardous facilities emit more pollutants where they face the least resistance, disadvantaged communities face a special health risk. In trying to determine whether race or income has the bigger impact on a neighborhood's exposure to pollution, however, scholars tend to overlook the facilities themselves and the effect of their characteristics on emissions. In particular, how do the characteristics of facilities and their surrounding communities jointly shape pollution outcomes? We propose a new line of environmental justice research that focuses on facilities and how their features combine with communities' features to create dangerous emissions. Using novel fuzzy-set analysis techniques and the EPA's newly developed Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, we test the influence of facility and community factors on chemical plants' health-threatening emissions. Contrary to the idea that community characteristics have singular, linear effects, findings show that facility and community factors combine in a variety of ways to produce risky emissions. We speculate that as chemical firms experiment with different ways of producing goods and externalizing pollution costs, new ""recipes of risk'' are likely to emerge. The question, then, will no longer be whether race or income matters most, but in which of these recipes do they matter and how."
0,"In this article we develop and test a multi-level theory of the sources of self-control among adolescents. We argue that neighborhoods are an important structural source of self-control. We test this idea using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 9,171). Results from a multilevel structural equation model indicate that neighborhood disadvantage is a significant predictor of adolescent self-control, controlling for demographics, family characteristics, and social integration. Implications for future research on the role of neighborhood context in the development of self-control among youth are discussed. In addition, we discuss the implications for policy of multilevel theorizing."
0,"Social scientists describe culture as either coherent or incoherent and political dissent as either unifying or divisive. This article moves beyond such dichotomies. Content, historical, and network analyses of public debates on how to organize four lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Washington marches provide evidence for an integrative position. Rather than just describe consistencies or contradictions, we contend that the key analytic challenge is to explain the organization of differences. We propose one way of doing this using the mechanism of a cultural anchor. Within and across marches, a small collection of ideas remains fixed in the national conversation, yet in a way that allows activists to address their internal diversity and respond to unfolding historical events. These results suggest that activists do not simply organize around their similarities but, through cultural anchors, they use their commonalities to build a thinly coherent foundation that can also support their differences. Situated at the nexus of culture, social movements, sexualities, and networks, this article demonstrates how the anchoring mechanism works in the context of LGBT political organizing."
0,"While debates on the issues regarding global climate change (GCC) have been heated, little is known about the flows of information and influence that have affected the climate policy agenda. Investigating the U.S. congressional hearings on GCC held from 1979 through 2007, the authors explicate the policy network from which Congress has differentially utilized expertise for policy making on GCC. Analyses using statistical and blockmodeling methods reveal the relationships between the sectors to which the witnesses belonged and the hearings categorized according to their objectives and target areas. The findings show that the government science (e.g., national labs) and nonprofit science (e.g., universities) sectors have been most influential and equivalent toward the hearings. The congressional hearings joined by these two sectors have focused heavily on identifying problems and searching for alternative policy options, while giving less attention to assessing negative impacts from GCC. Other sectors (i.e., government, advocacy, for-profit science, industry) have occupied unique yet marginal positions in addressing GCC issues."
0,"Despite recent emphasis on the importance of  life-long-learning for workers in a post-industrial, knowledge economy, there is considerable scepticism that such strategies hold much promise for workers who reach adulthood with low levels of educational attainment.  In this study we draw on two national surveys of adult education and training to ask whether less educated workers report similar gains from additional training as the more educated. In a perfectly competitive labour market, the expectation is that similar investments in human capital will yield similar returns with respect to wages and other desirable job outcomes. Our results indicate that less educated workers are significantly more likely to report positive labour market outcomes, suggesting that the uneven distribution of educational and training opportunities among educational groups is a result of barriers to access."
0,"We assess the impact of the welfare state on cross-national variation in the gender wage gap. Earnings inequality between men and women is conceptualized as resulting from their different locations in the class hierarchy, combined with the severity of wage differentials between and within classes. This decomposition contributes to identifying the relevant dimensions Of we are states and testing their impact on women's relative earnings. Our empirical analysis is based on income and occupation-based indicators of class and utilizes microdata for 17 post-industrial societies. We find systematic differences between welfare regimes in the components of the gender gap. The evidence supports our claim that the state molds gender inequality in labor market attainments by influencing women class positions and regulating class inequality."
0,"This paper tests Samuel and Pearl Oliner's theory that extensivity is a cause of prosocial behaviors, using data from the 1995 and 2005 waves of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey. Principal components analysis of a set of 19 questions about moral obligations supports the Oliners' contention that some individuals have a constricted moral sense, meaning that they feel stronger obligations to help family members and friends than strangers, while others have an extensive moral sense and feel obligated to help both close and distant others. Tobit regression demonstrates that people with extensive moral obligations are more likely than people with constricted obligations to engage in volunteer work and charitable giving. These results provide independent support for the Oliners' theory, and encourage further research on extensivity. "
0,"Research on cultural consumption convincingly demonstrates that the types of cultural products individuals consume have a high correlation with SES variables.  Such studies find that highly educated individuals are much more likely to consume so-called high culture such as:  opera, ballet, and fine art found in museums.  The problem is, we dont really know the ways in which education may influence cultural experiences, especially how individuals understand and make sense of their cultural consumption.   Not knowing this process means that our understanding of the relationship between culture and stratification does not rest upon data, but what may be considered elitist assumptions about necessary prerequisites to cultural consumption.  In this paper I test three common assumptions made about cultural consumption: 1) those having higher education are more likely to respond positively to high culture, 2) less educated individuals are more likely to express that they dont understand high culture, 3) that not understanding high culture results in negative reactions to it.  Data collected from two-hundred eighty-five people reacting to nine high art outdoor sculptures challenge the first and third assumptions.  Unexpectedly, I find that High School or less respondents and Post-Bachelors respondents respond quite positively to the sculptures and that not understanding a sculpture does not necessarily result in negative reactions.  The data support a relationship between education and not understanding sculpture.  The paper explains the unexpected findings by reconceptualizing the role of education in explaining arts consumption."
0,"Sociologists have investigated the importance of social capital for many outcomes, but the influence of various types of social capital-particularly intergenerational closure-on inequality in students' academic skills remains unclear. In this study, the authors draw on and extend theoretical perspectives rooted in Coleman and Bourdieu to assess the impact of both strong and weak ties on children's learning. Analyzing data on first graders from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), the authors show that multiple types of social capital are distributed unequally by social class, and that these disparities in social capital partially mediate the relationship between social class and gains in math skills. Intergenerational closure, however, does not promote learning net of other factors. Supporting primarily Bourdieu's perspective on social capital, the authors conclude that weak ties in particular are critical in explaining class inequality in learning, even during the early years of a child's education."
0,"Women have made dramatic inroads into academic posts in social sciences in the pst several decades, but their entry into academic careers in chemistry and physics has lagged behind rates for social sciences. This uneven entry of women into posts in different fields has been explained in individualistic terms or as outcomes of early life experiences. In this study we examine the variable structures of careers in academic sciences across disciplinary field. We suggest that combinations of normative and structural features of academic fields influence rates of women's entry. The interplay of networks of sponsorship and mentoring, critical selection points, and timed benchmarks, in combination, create greater barriers for women in physics and chemistry than in social scientists. Normative careers as they vary by academic discipline likely are powerful, but under-researched, factors in the differential entry rates of women scientists by field."

0,"This article explores the moral economy through which poor women apply shared understandings of what is fair, just, and appropriate to their use of nonprofit services. The findings suggest that such women perceive that others are needier than they, avoid undeserving opportunist labels (yet apply them to others), and complain that nonprofits routinely violate their moral obligations by withholding services or not affording respect. These views lead to ""conspicuous constraint,"" or service use only in the direst of circumstances, in which women claim to reject help, in part, so that needy others might receive aid. The author argues that this allows them to construct an image of themselves as self-reliant, morally empowered, benevolent actors in line with neoliberal rhetoric. Given that the public welfare system has transferred more responsibility for delivery of services to the nonprofit sector, the very sector that many poor women avoid, their well-being is of great concern."
0,"The study investigates the influences of women's attitudes about gender and couples' housework allocation patterns on women's employment status and work hours across the life course. The influence of these factors on the employment characteristics of continuously married women is investigated at four time points: 1977, 1980, 1985, and 1993. Data come from the Intergenerational Panel Study of Parents and Children and the analysis sample includes 556 continuously married women. Findings from structural equation, fixed effects, and tobit models offer consistent evidence of long-term positive influences of women's egalitarian gender ideology and men's participation in routine housework on women's labor force participation. The results provide evidence of a process of lagged adaptation through which wives' employment patterns are responsive to individual and couple characteristics over long intervals of time.

0,"This piece draws on symbolic interactionism to explain why leftist parties in Brazil first broached debates on homosexual liberation in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Electoral institutional changes and the emergence of a new generation of cadres changed left party militants audience calculations. The emergence of a youth counterculture also expanded a discursive repertoire, permitting party militants to contest meanings historically attached to the body, sexuality, the political, and everyday life. The article seeks to extend symbolic interactionisms methodological tools and insights to areas undertheorized in the paradigm, establishing a dialogue with a literature on political parties and electoral institutions."
0,"Adolescent substance use is an important area of research in sociology; however, there is a lack of research on nonmedical prescription drug use. The dearth of research on this topic is problematic given the relatively high prevalence of use among adolescents, the drastic increase in use in recent years, and the potential negative consequences from misusing prescription drugs. Using data from a national sample of adolescents, this research fills an important gap in the literature by testing one of the most prominent theories of deviance: social learning theory. Findings support variables related to social learning theory as correlates of nonmedical prescription drug use. Adolescents with definitions that are pro-substance use, whose peers use drugs, and whose parents and peers have attitudes that condone substance use are more likely to report nonmedical prescription drug use in the past year. Important implications and future research directions are discussed."
0,"Addressing the tendency to conceptualize subordination in law along a single-axis framework, I illustrate the multidimensional experience of discrimination in immigration law.  Using narrative analysis, I explain and convey the intersectional experiences of Chinese women during the Chinese Exclusion Era in American history.  My narrative focuses on how immigration laws shaped women’s experiences as potential prostitutes and as dependents on men.  My analysis indicates that the constitutive experience of law generally, and multidimensional discrimination specifically, can be conveyed through the use of narrative."
0,"As global integration increases, the implications for state boundaries and citizens' identity grow more significant. Some scholars suggest that the recognition of dual citizenship reveals the extent to which cross-national immigration requires states to formally recognize a multiplicity of national identities through dual citizenship (Aleinikoff and Klusmeyer 2002; Castles and Davidson 2000; Falk 1994). We propose that scholars need to additionally consider citizenship identity as a source of national assimilation of the international community and postnational citizenship in world culture (Brubaker 1992a; Faist 2004; Soysal 1994; Turner 2001). We use logistic regression to evaluate this argument by examining factors that lead states to enact legislation recognizing dual citizenship. The resulting analysis suggests that the recognition of dual citizenship reflects national, ex-colonial, and postnational cultural identities rather than the presence of cross-national immigration."

0,"Prior research on racial and ethnic disparities in the area of health and work are limited by the simple way functional health trajectories are conceptualized. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this project will use a novel latent class growth analysis to capture the multifaceted connections between health and work participation that transpire over the life course. By capturing the different types of functional health trajectories, this project will improve our assessment of the extent, magnitude, and cause of the racial and ethnic disparities in health and in work participation. This study will also advance core theoretical arguments concerning how social factors at the individual and community level affect racial and ethnic health/work disparities. As a result, we will gain new knowledge about how and why health limitations unequally affect the ability of minorities and whites to participate in work."
0,"Patterns of gender differences in educational outcomes among children of U.S. immigrants reflect trends of a female advantage in educational attainment and achievement that is increasingly common throughout U.S. society. However, these findings are more puzzling in the case of children of immigrants because this pattern is often such a sharp departure from that in most immigrants home countries, where women are often much less educated than men. Using data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), this study examines gender differences in grade point averages and educational expectations among middle school and high school students from several ethnic groups, including Cubans, Mexicans, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Nicaraguans, Jamaicans, Haitians, Colombians, Laotians and Dominicans. The study finds that female advantages are consistent across ethnic groups, but the magnitude of gender gaps varies. Factors both at home and at school contribute to gender disparities. Girls spend more time on homework and less time watching television and perceive that their parents have higher aspirations for them; boys, on the other hand, have more negative perceptions of the school environment and are more focused on family relationships, perhaps to the detriment of school relationships. These findings suggest that processes in families and schools early on lead to later gender differences in educational attainment among children of immigrants."

The study group includes those corporations in the Standard and Poors 500 that are required by the Environmental Protection Agency to report their toxic emissions under the agencys Toxic Release Inventory program.  A longitudinal analysis was used to examine the effects of a range of corporate characteristics on the parent companys toxic emission rates between 1994 and 2001.  The analysis shows that corporations that were politically active, had lower financial capacity, distributed a larger piece of their financial pie to shareholders, and were larger and older tended to have higher pollution rates.  Corporations with these characteristics engaged in negative externalities by externalizing their pollution costs to society."
0,"Achievement testing is the centerpiece of the state accountability systems mandated by the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).  The public attention directed towards achievement scores has largely eclipsed the crucial role that graduation rates play in NCLB accountability, at least until recently.  As a new body of research on graduation rates is gaining wider currency, we are just now coming to an uncomfortable realization  the nation appears to be facing a crisis in high school completion.  These findings have prompted much-needed investigations into several key areas:  the origins of the laws concern about graduation rates; status of graduates and dropouts for NCLB accountability; the consequences of using different ways to define and measure graduation rates; and state strategies for incorporating graduation rates into their federal accountability plans.  This paper draws on recent research and analysis in an attempt to clarify these issues and to offer a foundation upon which to ground on-going policy debates, future research into the graduation and dropout  phenomena, and the shape of the next generation of educational accountability systems."
0,"This paper examines the effects of neoliberalism on cross-national income inequality.  Neoliberalism has been the dominant development strategy since the 1980s and continues to dominate discussions of economic development.  However, the results of neoliberal reform have been mixed-at-best.  Critiques of neoliberalism highlight the importance of unique domestic contexts for understanding neoliberal failures while research on cross-national income inequality focus on the importance of domestic political arrangements.  Therefore, we propose a political contingency model and argue that political arrangements moderate the relationship between neoliberalism and inequality.  Using data from the Standardized Income Distribution Database (Babones and Alvarez-Rivadulla 2007) we use an unbalanced sample of 50 countries for the years 1975 to 1996 to examine this argument.  Results from random-effects regression models provide support for the political contingency model proposed."
0,"Research on the consequences of social movements typically aims to identify determinants of success or to draw attention to ways that social movements are able to secure new benefits for constituents by gaining concessions from political authorities. Yet social movements, even those that are ultimately defeated, may have an enduring impact on the communities in which they were once active. This impact may be far removed from the movement's stated goals and may be detrimental to constituents and to society at large. We identify an empirical relationship between Ku Klux Klan activism in the 1960s and increased numbers of homicides in southern U.S. counties in subsequent decades. We explain this finding by drawing attention to ways in which right-wing extremism can disrupt community cohesion, generate mistrust in legal authorities, and promote interpretations of conflict and conflict resolution that weaken constraints on violent behavior."
0,"Because movements face distinct challenges in different phases, we expect predominant organizational forms to shift across phases (Minkoff 1994). While all phases confront strategic dilemmas (Jasper 2004), they can be particularly acute in emergent phases when collective actors seek to initiate and accelerate opportunity spirals. Organizational innovation can be particularly important at those junctures (Clemens 1993). This research identifies the specific strategic challenges that characterize such an emergent phase and how leaders attempted to resolve them through organizational innovation  i.e. the design and promotion of a new model to facilitate movement transition. Empirically, the research presents a case study of widespread mobilization around issues of race relations during World War II, known collectively as the civic unity movement, based on the promotion of local race relations committees (RRCs) in hundreds of American cities. I trace the processes by which the RRC model was designed and promoted by a hub of movement leaders in Chicago. I identify two central strategic dilemmas that they confronted, related to compromised opportunities of the war era: first, the needs to simultaneously promote political legitimacy and political opposition; and, second, the need to cultivate state commitment while mobilizing to make claims upon it. I explain the way that the RRC model was designed to resolve those dilemmas so as to facilitate movement development and transition. Findings add to and revise our understanding of the relationship between organizational models, strategic choice, and movement development."
0,"Previous research has suggested that prisons can both reduce and increase crime. These counterbalancing effects will have different timings. Prison reduces crime by denying those currently behind bars the opportunity to commit further offenses. However, the prison experience and the stigma of an incarceration record can be criminogenic. Once released, ex-inmates might commit more crimes than they otherwise would have. Additionally, an influx of former inmates can cause social disorganization in the community at large. Unlike incapacitation, these crime-promoting effects are not limited to the present, but are based on the proportion of the population that has experienced incarceration either in the current year or in any past year. While some previous studies have recognized the counterbalancing effects, they have only considered the contemporaneous impacts. We develop a statistical model that captures the contemporaneous and lagged effects of incarceration and reentry on property and violent crime rates. State-level panel data results (1978-2003) suggest that, with the inclusion of just 5 years of lags for incarceration and prisoner societal reentry rates, any crime-reducing benefits of increased incarceration are completely eliminated by the crime-promoting effects associated with the increasing prevalence of ex-prisoners. This conclusion is robust to several alternative specifications, including one that accounts for potential reverse causality between the crime and incarceration rates. "

Our survey examined how the number of homosexual contacts respondents have affects their attitudes, beliefs, and levels of comfort towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals and the community. We found statistically significant evidence that students with close LGBTQ contacts (close friends and family) have more positive attitudes and beliefs and a higher level of comfort towards the LGBTQ community, on average than students who have no close LGBTQ contacts. We also found no evidence that levels of homophobia differ between male and female respondents at St. Olaf, which diverges from previous research. Overall, we found that St. Olaf students generally have positive attitudes, beliefs, and are comfortable with LGBTQ individuals and the community."
0,"In the last two decades, the childrens market has expanded dramatically, in terms of both direct expenditures by children, and their influence on parental purchases. This in turn has led to increased attention to children by marketers, and a process of commodification of both childhood, as a saleable cultural concept, and children themselves, who have become the objects of intense marketing activity. In this paper, I discuss three recent trends which illustrate the trend toward commodification: the rise of intrusive, naturalistic research methods to study children, the expansion of peer-to-peer and other forms of grassroots marketing using children themselves, and a new discourse of kid empowerment employed by marketers. My discussion is based on research in the advertising industry carried out during 2001 and 2002."
0,"Edelman and others have clearly demonstrated that the development of HR departments is an institutionalized organizational response to the proliferation of EEO/AA laws over the last 40 years. Thus, HR Personnel (HRPs) are key actors and HR departments the central location of an organizations response to the external pressures of employment law and key to understanding how employment law lives in organizations. Drawing primarily from an ethnography of a large HR department, the current paper argues that 1) their work is not only a symbol of compliance but that the shadow of the law (both procedurally and substantively) is evident in their decision-making, 2) this role puts them in a contradictory position with respect to the managerial goals of the organization, 3) for this and other reasons, the profession is ambivalent about its role as legal interpreter and enforcer and this is reflected in a managerial legalization of their work and rhetoric, and 4) HR departments tend to suffer from organizational containment of their functions; in the language of the profession, HR is in a perpetual struggle to get a seat at the table. Implications for understanding the life of employment law in complex organizations are discussed."
0,"Drawing on 103 in-depth interviews with middle-class blacks in the New York and Atlanta metropolitan areas, and photographs of art displayed in their homes, this paper provides the first systematic examination of black consumption of visual art and racial identity. This paper also extends theory on cultural consumption and black middle-class racial identity by showing how elite blacks use black visual art to construct specific dimensions of their racial identity. New York and Atlanta are ideal cities to explore black art consumption because of their large black middle-class populations and rich histories of black artistic production and consumption. I argue that black visual art is tied to five dimensions of black identity: self-categorization, shared fate, individual narrative, collective narrative, and ideology.   First, when middle-class blacks use black art to express that they classify themselves as black, they use visual art for self-categorization.  Second, when middle-class blacks draw on black art to express feelings of attachment to other blacks, they use visual art to articulate a sense of shared fate. Next, when middle-class blacks use black art to illustrate their individual black experiences, they use visual art to articulate personal narratives. Fourth, when middle-class blacks use black art to illustrate the shared experiences of blacks, they use visual art to articulate collective narratives. Finally, when middle-class blacks draw on  black art to articulate the group position of blacks, they use visual art to express black ideologies."
0,"We extend research on black-white gaps in the subjective quality of life by exploring recent General Social Survey data, focusing attention on Latinos, and probing the value of partial proportional odds models for ordinal quality-of-life measures. Results indicate a declining but discernable black-white gap for four measures-marital happiness, overall happiness, health status and trust-and the persistence of a gap for another-satisfaction with finances. Although Latinos as a whole have a lower quality of life than non-Latinos, significant differences between Mexican-origin Latinos and those from other countries emerge for only two quality-of-life measures, overall happiness and financial satisfaction. The partial proportional odds models overcome technical problems common to the analysis of ordinal dependent variables and establish both the magnitude and location of inequalities."
0,"Since its establishment, the government of Israel has fostered divisiveness through differential laws and practices towards the three principal religious groups of the Arab minority (Muslims, Christians, and Druze). The most favorable treatment has been accorded to the Druze, with Christians ranked second, and Muslims the least. The outcomes and the effects of these policies are to preserve separate ethnic and religious identities and to discourage an Arab collective national identity. This study examines the community of Shafa-amr, a religiously mixed city in Western Galilee. Differential policy is revealed in the community-specific housing and education projects for the Druze people. This study also reveals how the three religious groups were receptive to this differential treatment, thereby helping to sustain separate ethnic and religious identities."

0,"Suburban maintenance gardening is one service sector that has grown in the United States, and in many parts of the country it has become a gendered occupational niche for Mexican immigrant men. What is the social organization of this occupation and to what extent are Mexican immigrant gardeners following in the footsteps of Japanese gardeners, achieving socioeconomic mobility through gardening? Based on interviews conducted with 47 Mexican immigrant maintenance gardeners in Los Angeles, this article examines the occupational structure of this informal sector job, the social context in which it has developed, the mix of informal and formal economic transactions involved, and the strategic challenges that gardeners negotiate. The data show that there is occupational differentiation and mobility within the gardening occupation, and that mobility in the job remains dependent on combining both ethnic entrepreneurship and subjugated service work. Gendered social and human capital, together with financial and legal capital are necessary for occupational mobility. Jardineria, or suburban maintenance gardening, is analogous to the longstanding labor incorporation of female immigrant domestic workers into affluent households, but it is also indicative of a new trend: the proliferation of hybrid forms of entrepreneurship and service work and the incorporation of masculine ""dirty work"" service jobs into affluent households."
0,"The 2008 collapse of the world financial system, while proximately linked to the housing bubble and risk-laden mortgage backed securities, was a consequence of the financialization of the U.S. economy since the 1970s. This article examines the institutional and income dynamics associated with the financialization of the U.S. economy, advancing a sociological explanation of income shifts into the finance sector. Complementary developments include banking deregulation, finance industry concentration, increased size and scope of institutional investors, the shareholder value movement, and dominance of the neoliberal policy model. As a result, we estimate that between 5.8 and 6.6 trillion dollars were transferred to the finance sector since 1980. We conclude that understanding inequality dynamics requires attention to market institutions and politics."
0,"The organic movement is facing a challenging set of circumstances.  Organic farming practices have achieved formal government recognition through the National Organic Program and organic products now have widespread consumer appeal.  Yet the initial goals of the organic movement, the promotion of small-scale, local, environmentally sustainable production, have been undermined as large national and international corporations have entered the market.  This paper identifies the challenges faced by organic advocates and the strategies that are being utilized to revive the movement and to advance its original goals."
0,"This paper focuses on identity narratives provided by first-generation Lebanese immigrants in New York City, Montreal and Paris.  Most analyses of immigrant identities tend to think of identity as destined to either retain its original roots and strengthening forms of ethnicity, or disappear through assimilation.  However, members of the Lebanese diaspora in the three cities are constantly involved in processes of association and disassociation in both the homeland and the host society.  Identity narratives slightly varied by country of immigration, but overall, the majority of respondents narrated their identities in diasporic ways.  Ethnic identification was more prominent in Montreal and Paris  two contexts where being Lebanese particularity served the specific social and political goals that immigrants in these cities pursued.  A large group of immigrants point out that they understand their social position in multiple and sometimes contradictory ways  what I refer to as a transnational narrative. The third theme of identity narrative emphasizes cosmopolitan ways of belonging.  After highlighting the three identity narratives present in the Lebanese diaspora, the paper concludes by asserting the need to move beyond unitary understandings of immigrant identities.  Contending that negotiations and ambivalence about their position in the various societies they belong to is the overarching narrative that most of the Lebanese respondents share, diasporic identification is taken to be one of constant critique of cultural norms and social traditions as well as the creation of multiple forms of attachments and spheres of engagement."
0,"Studies of peer effects in educational settings confront two main problems. The first is the presence of endogenous sorting which confounds the effects of social influence and social selection on individual attainment. The second is how to account for the local network dependencies through which peer effects influence individual behavior. We empirically address these problems using longitudinal data on academic performance, friendship, and advice seeking relations among students in a full-time graduate academic program. We specify stochastic agent-based models that permit estimation of the interdependent contribution of social selection and social influence to individual performance. We report evidence of peer effects. Students tend to assimilate the average performance of their friends and of their advisors. At the same time, students attaining similar levels of academic performance are more likely to develop friendship and advice ties. Together, these results imply that processes of social influence and social selection are sub-components of a more general a co-evolutionary process linking network structure and individual behavior. We discuss possible points of contact between our findings and current research in the economics and sociology of education. "
0,"Empirical research based on movements in nondemocracies has underscored the “repression paradox” as a major limitation on the political opportunity structure (POS) thesis, where repression has been shown to both facilitate and discourage mobilization. Departing from current efforts to reconceptualize the POS to reconcile contrary findings, however, I argue that a movement’s internal characteristics require a central place in assessing its outcomes, particularly in relation to movement ascendance and its impact on the activation of protest cycles and on the wider polity. Analyzing the rise of a particularly militant movement that seriously contested state power during Taiwan’s transition from dictatorship from 1991 to 1992, I contend that the interplay between strategic framing and high-risk protest tactics not only enables movement survival under state repression; it also crucially mediates the movement’s capacity to develop a “master frame” that can generate a broader protest cycle in support of political change. In particular, the Taiwanese nation-building movement’s framing of antiauthoritarian resistance coupled with the activists’ willingness to die collectively in pursuit of their goals gave rise to a human rights master frame that ultimately led to the amendment of the Sedition Law and the restoration of civil liberties."
0,"The relative numbers of women and men are changing dramatically in China, but the consequences of these imbalanced sex ratios have received little empirical attention. We merge data from the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey with community-level data from Chinese censuses to examine the relationship between cohort- and community-specific sex ratios and women's partnering behavior. Consistent with demographic-opportunity theory and sociocultural theory, we find that high sex ratios (indicating more men relative to women) are associated with an increased likelihood that women marry before age 25. However, high sex ratios are also associated with an increased likelihood that women engage in premarital and extramarital sexual relationships and have more than one sexual partner, findings consistent with demographic-opportunity theory but inconsistent with sociocultural theory."
0,"This research addresses the complexity of embedded inter-firm ties. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data from field research in the computer motherboard manufacturing industry, this paper investigates the origins of close ties and committed relationships, and explores the relationships between these two dimensions of embedded inter-firm relationships. The results show that companies establish close relationships with their partners to resolve coordination uncertainty due to a high level of task interdependence in their exchanges, and that firms become more collaboratively committed when they seek to alter a disadvantaged power asymmetry. At the same time, the fieldwork found an underlying conflict between the embeddedness dimensions of closeness and commitment: too much closeness reduces a partner's commitment. These findings have significant implications for the formation of embedded corporate ties as well as the effects of embeddedness on organizations. "
0,"This article proposes that one of the ways to enrich the relationship between culture and subjectivity is through specific identification of cultural constitution of new scenarios of subjectivities that are available to individuals in everyday life. More precisely this article will seek to describe how the new cultural order in Israel invented during the first decade of the establishment of the state a new life category, ""gifted disadvantaged"", which was previously unknown in the discursive and practical fields in Israel. The final discussion includes a description of two hermeneutic understanding involved in manning the new subjectivity. Study of cultural constitution of scenarios of subjectivities thus may provide us with refined understandings of the dialectics between structure-culture-agency that are at the root of cultural sociology."

0,"We conducted a vignette survey to investigate the effects of situational factors-such as a group's size, the amount of status differentiation among its members, and the type of task on which they work-on respondents' reports of the ""fair allocation"" of resources to members of status-heterogeneous task groups. We argue that to the degree that situational factors make productivity, status and competence more relevant, allocators will increase the weight of equity compared to equality, and to the degree that they make the maintenance of positive relations among members relevant, allocators will decrease the weight of equity compared to equality. Each vignette described members of a status-unequal work group with three, four, or five members. We use status characteristics theory to calculate status inequality for each group. Groups' tasks were described as either regular or temporary, requiring either interdependent or independent relations between coworkers, and involving routine or nonroutine working conditions. Participants from the United States and from Turkey read a series of vignettes and for each wrote what they thought was the fairest salary for each group member. Using reward expectations theory, our balance model and reported allocations, we estimate empirically the weight of equity for respondents and vignettes. All of the situational factors we identify do affect the equity-equality balance, though some only in interactions. We demonstrate that our balance model of distributive justice provides a useful instrument to capture these effects. "
0,"Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (1998-1999), this study examines the impact of parental involvement on learning-related behaviors, and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems among third grade students.  To capture the many ways parents can enhance student’s behavior, measures of involvement at school and in the home were utilized.  The results indicate that students whose parents volunteer at school and attend school events, have more ties with other parents, and hold higher expectations regarding school had significantly better learning-related behaviors and fewer behavioral problems, controlling for prior behavior and family background.  Additionally, father’s involvement in homework had a positive and independent effect on student’s behavior even after using sophisticated controls.  Further, multivariate analysis suggests parent involvement mediates the relationship between family socioeconomic background, marital status and student behavior. On the other hand, parent involvement does not seem to explain the racial/ethnic gaps in student’s behavior."
0,"The debate about racial residential preferences has two open questions. First, are neighborhood racial preferences truly racial, or is race a proxy for socio-economic factors? Second, are in-group or out-group preferences more salient? Using the Houston Area Survey, we employ a factorial experiment to assess the effect of racial composition on neighborhood desirability independent of crime, school quality and property values. We survey whites, blacks and Hispanics to examine in-group vs. out-group preferences. Results show that independent of proxies, whites find neighborhoods less attractive as the proportion black or Hispanic increases; the proportion Asian has no impact. Racial composition has little effect on Hispanics' and blacks' neighborhood preferences. We find no evidence of in-group preferences; rather, results suggest that whites express negative out-group preferences toward black and Hispanic neighborhoods."
0,"Much research on human interaction focuses on the audible world, with silence sometimes only being studied as an absence.  In this formulation, to have a voice is to have power, and to mute the voices of others is to further expand that power.  However, this is not the only way silence functions.  The following explores the nature of silence through participant observation of Quaker Meetings and Buddhist meditation.  This project analyzes how the performance of silence is taught to a newcomer, illustrating tensions between speech and silence, and how different forms of silence are created in social interaction."
0,"Previous research has found religion to have primarily positive effects on marital stability and relationship quality.  Some researchers argue that church attendance is the only religious predictor of marital stability (Brown et al 2008).  The current study is a longitudinal examination of the effect of religiosity on divorce, including examining church attendance, but also examining eleven other aspects of religiosity and religious beliefs.  Data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States reveal that not only does church attendance protect against divorce ten years later, but several other aspects of one’s religiosity can protect against later divorce, as well, including identifying with one’s religious group and the importance one places on religion.  Conversely, two measures generally considered to be characteristic of more radical Christians, belief that the Bible is the actual Word of God and considering one’s self to be a “born again” Christian, do not protect against later divorce.  Findings are discussed in light of the current literature."
0,"Class mobility research has been scarce in India and moreover no previous research has analysed the mobility experience of women. In this paper we analyse patterns of marital mobility of women in India and compare those patterns to mens mobility through own employment. We specifically study the role caste plays in marital mobility. Using the 2004 National Election Study data with over 28,000 respondents, we find that rather than there being more mobility for women through marriage than for men through employment as observed in the West, in India the situation is reversed. The direct inheritance effect seen to work for men from service class, petty business and agricultural families in the West seems to hold for Indian women though not through the traditional channel of inheriting fathers occupation, but by marrying into a class similar to the fathers.  In terms of caste we see this effect to be the strongest for the higher castes that are able to maintain their privileges more for their daughters than for their sons. The possible reason for the departure of the Indian case from Western research might be due to the continued practice of arranged marriages; this possibility is discussed in detail."
0,"The rise in subprime lending and the ensuing wave of foreclosures was partly a result of market forces that have been well-identified in the literature, but it was also a highly racialized process. We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche of minority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing foreclosure actions in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling for a variety of housing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvestment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of foreclosures across U.S. metropolitan areas. To isolate subprime lending as the causal mechanism through which segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. We thus conclude that segregation was an important contributing cause of the foreclosure crisis, along with overbuilding, risky lending practices, lax regulation, and the bursting of the housing price bubble."
0,"Collective memory studies are now prominent in cultural sociology, but the emphasis on structural analyses has led to an absence of conceptual and empirical insight into the process of collective memory production.  Through a symbolic interactionist approach, I propose that actors produce collective memory at the meso-level of the family at the same time that they use collective narratives as cultural scripts to structure and give purpose to their family memories.  I analyze twenty in-depth interviews with children of Holocaust survivors I conducted in 2008, and find that the relationship between family memory and collective memory in this case is dialectical.  While collective stories certainly shape memory, family memorya type of memory many scholars overlookoperates as an influential lens through which individuals relate to popular narratives and negotiate their diffuse meanings.  As secondary witnesses, children of Holocaust survivors can help illuminate collective memory processes because their understandings about the Holocaust are always mediated by their parents, family, and community networks, and by the cultural products they consume."
0,"This study examines how the neighborhood environments experienced over multiple generations of a family influence childrens cognitive ability.  Building on recent research showing strong continuity in neighborhood environments across generations of family members, we argue for a revised perspective on neighborhood effects that considers the ways in which the neighborhood environment in one generation may have a lingering impact on the next generation.  To specify such multigenerational effects is not simply a theoretical problem, but poses considerable methodological challenges.  Instead of traditional regression techniques that may obscure multigenerational effects of neighborhood disadvantage, we utilize newly developed methods designed to generate unbiased treatment effects when treatments and confounders vary over time.  The results confirm a powerful link between neighborhoods and cognitive ability that extends across generations.  Being raised in a high-poverty neighborhood in one generation has a substantial negative effect on child cognitive ability in the next generation.  A familys exposure to neighborhood poverty across two consecutive generations reduces child cognitive ability by roughly half a standard deviation."
0,"In this paper, I examine how the construction of the expressways in 1960s~1970s South Korea was promoted by the governmental agencies. To do this, I analyze the discourse of 'Kosok Toro,' the equivalent word of 'expressway.' This will show how discourses of speed in modernization organized the belief on the construction. Second, I interpret the way how the government tried to persuade their nationals to trust the necessity of expressways. In doing so, they even devaluated the railway system by mobilizing nationalistic discourses. Finally, I focus on a novel named ""Kosok Toro [Expressway]"" which was serialized in a major newpaper. This novel shows that the expressway was received as an ethical guideline to the public at that time."
0,"Despite the large literature on the long-term effects of parental divorce, few studies have analyzed the effects of parental divorce on spouse selection behavior. However, the characteristics of one's spouse can have important effects on economic well-being and on marital success. We use discrete-time, event-history data from Finnish population registers to study the effects of parental divorce on entry into marriage with spouses who have different educational qualifications (both absolute and relative to one's own education), using conditional multinomial logistic regression models. The results show that Finnish children of divorce have lower rates of marriage than those from intact families. In particular, children of divorce have a lower likelihood of marrying spouses with secondary education or more, and especially low rates of marrying someone with a tertiary degree. The latter gap is smaller among those with tertiary education, as a result of the higher rates of homogamous marriage among the children of divorce with high education. Our findings suggest that children of divorce carry with them traits and behaviors that make them less marriageable candidates in the marriage market. We discuss the possible implications of these findings."
0,"We examine the effect of the race, age, and gender of victims of assault on the offenders' use of weapons and lethal intent. Evidence from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) suggests that offenders are particularly likely to use guns against young black men-a three-way interaction - and to kill black males and young black adults. Black offenders respond more strongly to the victim's race than do white offenders. As a result of these effects, a violent incident between two young black men is about six times more likely to involve a gun than a violent incident between two young white men. We suggest that adversary effects, i.e., an offender's tactical response to the threat posed by adversaries, help explain why violence in black communities tends to be much more serious than violence in white communities.

0,"The internal migration patterns of Latino immigrants in terms of varying levels of ethnic spatial concentration are often analyzed in the context of ethnic enclave and spatial assimilation perspectives. Assimilation trajectories of the adult children of Latino immigrants are less understood when classified into different “decimal” generations based on the age of arrival to the U.S. This paper uses data from the 2000 5% Public Use Micro Sample of the U.S. Census to examine the secondary migration patterns of foreign-born Mexicans, Cubans, and Dominicans. Immigrants are grouped into 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 generational statuses in order to investigate the relationship between stages of childhood development with future socioeconomic and acculturation outcomes. The results from this analysis demonstrate assimilation processes that could be described under both spatial and segmented perspectives. Mexicans of the 1.75 generation most closely resemble a spatial assimilation trajectory, while 1.75-generation Cubans exhibit patterns consistent with segmented assimilation theory. Dominicans may be experiencing the “spatial” element of the assimilation process without the benefits of increased human and financial capital."
0,"One shortcoming in the literature on policy framing has been the absence of analytic models through which to explicate change. This paper advances research in this area in three related ways. First, it links policy frames to the actors who employ them. Second, based upon this linkage it proposes two complementary approaches for examining longitudinal change in policy framing. an actor representation approach and a frame adoption approach. Third, it assesses the relative contribution Of each process using demographic decomposition analysis. This analytic framework is illustrated using the case of debates over welfare reform in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. The findings are consistent with expectations from the frame adoption approach, suggesting that ideational diffusion was largely responsible for changing discourse during this period."
0,"The changing demographic landscape of the United States calls for a reassessment of the societal impacts and consequences of so-called ""natural"" and technological disasters. An increasing trend towards greater demographic and socio-economic diversity (in part due to high rates of international immigration), combined with mounting disaster losses, have brought about a more serious focus among scholars on how changing population patterns shape the vulnerability and resiliency of social systems. Recent disasters, such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami (2004) and Hurricane Katrina (2005), point to the differential impacts of disasters on certain communities, particularly those that do not have the necessary resources to cope with and recover from such events. This paper interprets these impacts within the context of economic, cultural, and social capital, as well as broader human ecological forces. The paper also makes important contributions to the social science disaster research literature by examining population growth, composition, and distribution in the context of disaster risk and vulnerability. Population dynamics (e.g., population growth, migration, and urbanization) are perhaps one of the most important factors that have increased our exposure to disasters and have contributed to the devastating impacts of these events, as the case of Hurricane Katrina illustrates. Nevertheless, the scientific literature exploring these issues is quite limited. We argue that if we fail to acknowledge and act on the mounting evidence regarding population composition, migration, inequality, and disaster vulnerability, we will continue to experience disasters with greater regularity and intensity."
0,"This article presents findings from a content analysis of all 460 ""Dear Lawyer Bao"" (DLB) legal advice columns published in its ten-year history (1989-98) in the Beijing Evening News. While much sociolegal research has focused on the exercise of power in the legal process through the control of meaning in verbal, private face-to-face interactions, this article reveals similar meaning-making processes at play in publicly disseminated writing where the audience is far larger, the potential impact far wider, and the role of the state far greater. Lawyer Bao's popular image as valiant defender of ordinary people in trouble obscured and thus enhanced both the degree to which he was beholden to the state and the effectiveness with which he did the bidding of the state against the interests of the very letter-writers he purported to help. His ultimate allegiance to the state is reflected in two empirical patterns. First, the temporal distribution of problem topics featured in the DLB column corresponds less to shifts in public sentiment or objective popular needs and more to legislation, policy shifts, and political campaigns. Second, whether Lawyer Bao legitimized or delegitimized letter-writers' claims was determined primarily by the extent to which state interests were at stake in the problem at hand. Lawyer Bao tended to delegitimize labor grievances, housing demolition grievances, collective grievances of any kind, and other claims construed as potentially destabilizing or of challenge to state priorities."

I am currently following, as a practitioner and observer, a waterworks project in Honduras that is sponsored by a United States rural water association in conjunction with a Honduran agency and Cornell University engineering professors and students.  The project is to build and maintain a gravity-fed water cleaning system for a rural community of about One Hundred and Twenty Honduran families.  The Cornell group is affiliated with the student run U.S. organization, Engineers for a Sustainable World.  This project is routinely promoted and advertised by the groups involved as an example of enlightened, ethical intervention.  Analysis of claims of what the project is, what it does, and how that is known as put forth in the course of this project is instructive for considerations of ethical interventions with regard to STS and engineering."
0,"Is there an association between occupational racial composition and nonfatal workplace injuries? Guided by several labor market theories (queuing, social closure, devaluation, poor market position, and human capital), we use occupational data from the U. S. Census and Dictionary of Occupational Titles combined with individual data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to answer this question. Hierarchical generalized linear models of individuals within occupations show that there is an association between occupational racial composition and workplace injuries, but this association is only statistically significant for white men in the model controlling for relevant occupational and individual level characteristics. A 10 percent increase in the occupation percent black is associated with a 28 percent increase in injury risk. Contrary to expectations, white men have the highest adjusted odds of injury; white women and black men have significantly lower odds of injury than white men. Additionally, occupation-level environmental hazards and individual-level education, hours worked per week, jobs with insurance benefits, working in the South, and specific industries are associated with differential injury risk. These findings are consistent with labor market theories that suggest social closure, market position, and individual skills contribute to differential labor market outcomes. We demonstrate that sociological theories of labor market inequality are useful for understanding workplace injury risk, and that workplace injuries should be studied as an outcome of social inequality. Keywords: occupational racial composition, work injury, health, labor markets, and social inequality."
0,"In this paper we examine the salience and stability of ethnic boundaries in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Data are based on the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a nationally-representative cross-sectional survey of African- and European-Americans conducted before and after 9/11. We examine the effect of 9/11 on two kinds of symbolic boundaries, interethnic, or feelings of closeness between ethnic groups, and intraethnic, or feelings of closeness within ethnic groups. Findings indicate that after 9/11 African-Americans did not feel closer to other African-Americans but felt closer to other ethnic groups, especially European-Americans. In contrast, European-Americans did not feel closer to African-Americans, nor any other ethnic group. These results suggest that recognition of common obstacles and problems can be a way to building the ""bridge over the racial divide, but only in a way limited by existing ethnic relations."
0,"Evidence of normative influence on health behavior has been broadly identified; however, issues regarding the transmission and enforcement of norms remain to be understood. Drawing from Giddens’ (1984) Theory of Structuration, Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation (1983), and theory of norms, this dissertation examines the mediating role of interpersonal communication in the norms-behavior and norms-intention relations. Specifically, this study proposes that normative messages are shared through the process of interpersonal communication and norms. An online survey from various student organizations in a major university was conducted to test hypotheses. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that interpersonal communication patterns fully mediated the relationship between group norms and drinking behavior, but communication was not a significant mediator of norms-drinking intention."
0,"The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of three different modeling approaches for exploring structural theories of violence. Specifically, ordinary least squares regression, geographically weighted regression and data envelopment analysis will be utilized to evaluate violent crime. This type of analysis expands upon traditional theory testing by deepening our understanding of differences in crime generation and its underlying demographic and socio-economic stimuli via different methodological lenses. A case study for the city of Cincinnati, Ohio is presented and the results suggest that a combination of approaches is likely the best strategy for evaluating violence in urban areas. "

0,"Studies about coalitions or divisions within social movements often emphasize movement organizations' resources or ideologies.  But disagreements over policy often reflect differences across a wide array of organizational characteristics, which can be considered as ""core political competencies.""  These include the organizations ideologies and material resources but also factors such as preferred tactics or experience in designing outreach campaigns.  In New Jersey, environmental lobby organizations split with local environmental groups by arguing that the state's collaborative watershed management program distracted from its duty to enforce environmental regulations.  In this case, differences in the opposing factions' competencies based on geographic focus and experience in state-level politics determined the split, rather than differences in ideology or resources."
0,"Using data from three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 1963), we examine associations between adolescent family experiences and young adult wellbeing across a range of indicators, including schooling, substance use, and family-related transitions. We compare children living with both biological parents, but whose parents differ in how often they argue, to children in stepfather and single-mother families, and we assess the extent to which differences can be understood in terms of family income and parenting practices. Findings suggest that parental conflict is associated with children's poorer academic achievement, increased substance use, and early family formation and dissolution. Living in single-mother and stepfather families tend to be more strongly associated with our indicators of well-being, although differences between these family types and living with high conflict continuously married parents are often statistically indistinguishable. Income and parenting largely do not account for associations between adolescent family type and later life outcomes. We conclude that while children do better, on average, living with two biological married parents, the advantages of two-parent families kare not shared equally by all. "
0,"Immigration continues to change the social, economic, and political landscapes of urban America. Consequently, scholars, as well as the general public, are interested in the internal migration patterns of immigrants. In this research, we identify and explain the characteristics of metropolitan areas that have the strongest effects on the percentage change in the foreign-born population between 1990 and 2000. Using lagged independent variables and a sample of 150 metropolitan areas, we find that settlement patterns among immigrants are diverging from traditional patterns. That is, those metropolitan areas that had moderately high levels of globalization and lower costs of living as well as lower disadvantage indicators (e.g., percentage poverty) in 1990, had larger increases in percentage foreign-born between 1990 and 2000 compared to areas with lower levels of globalization and higher costs of living and disadvantage. These trends suggest the increasing importance of second-tier metropolises such as Atlanta, Phoenix, and Las Vegas in understanding where immigrants settle."
0,"In this paper, I attempt to link the cultural context, in the form of the expectations of the audience, to the content of an art work, specifically, Igor Stravinskys The Rite of Spring. I explore the musical expectations of the audience at the premiere of The Rite of Spring, as a means of explaining the riot that occurred. The Rite of Spring challenged audience expectations in a rather unique way. Using the framework of social time, I stress not the dissonant aspects of the work as a reason for the audience reaction, but rather the subversion of the audiences temporal expectations. I give a brief discussion of music theory to show how temporal expectations function in common practice tonality. Examining the work, I demonstrate several techniques that Stravinsky used to deliberately subvert the audiences temporal expectations. Finally, I attempt to locate the work historically, to show that this type of temporal subversion was foreign to the audience."
0,"A widespread approach to assess the similarity of objects is to measure the extent to which they have similar relationships to other objects or settings. For example, the notion of structural equivalence calls two persons similar if they have similar relationships to other persons. This paper generalizes this approach and views two objects similar if they have similar relationships to \emph{similar} objects or settings. After proposing a geometrical representation for this generalized approach, we reanalyze two classic datasets: the Davis et al. (1941) data on social event attendance of 18 women, and the roll-call data of the U.S. Senate. We show that the proposed representation surpasses previous models of relational data, and illustrate how it opens up new possibilities for sociologists and social scientists in general."
0,"Americans often rely on meritocratic ideologies rather than structural factors to explain unequal labor market outcomes, but we know little about how such beliefs are contingent upon individuals' social locations. Taking advantage of unique survey data, this article examines how gender inequality in professional advancement is explained among successful women professionals in science, technology, and allied fields-an employment arena potentially characterized simultaneously by potent meritocratic ideologies and persistent gendered barriers. Using multinomial logistic regressions comparing structural and meritocratic frames for explaining the paucity of women at high levels, we show how respondents in different career and family circumstances use these conflicting perceptual lenses. We find that married women, those with business education, and those in the top levels of their organizations are more likely to account for gender inequality by invoking deficiencies in women's human capital or motivation, whereas mothers, primary breadwinners, sellers of professional services, and those working in unsupportive organizations are more likely to invoke structural explanations. This research has implications for social action. Successful women's beliefs about gender inequality may influence whether they help remove structural obstacles for other women, or whether, through adherence to the meritocratic ideology, they help reconstruct the glass ceilings they have cracked."
0,"We explore the transformation of consumer credit markets in France through the twentieth-century from a case study. The local, face-to-face credit market in Lens, northern France, developed against a background of immigration and so was not based on pre-existing social networks but on the attractiveness of credit and of the goods on offer. The entrepreneurs involved innovated by connecting together the Parisian textile networks and demand from working-class Polish families. They profited from their belonging to both Jewish and Polish communities. This credit was expensive, carried no interest, was inseparable from the goods sold and the home service provided, and was not understood by the authorities, staying in a black hole of state control. Two processes put an end to it: (i) the disappearance of a way of life, of the captive customer base, complicating face-to-face identification and requiring use of the states means of identification (vital statistics records, identity cards)with the state guaranteeing the identity of those involved on the market and extending business beyond networks of acquaintancesand (ii) legislative action and reorganization of credit activities to the advantage of commercial banks. The specificity of French credit market is that this is the state which first shaped markets in a move to standardize the economy. This formalization was extended by banks that progressively provided credit regardless of any personal relations."
0,"This article analyzes how the family and the welfare state influence household income trajectories after job loss in the United States and in western Germany. Drawing on panel data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), I study the income buffering effects of the family and the welfare state in the short an in the long run after job loss. I demonstrate that household income trajectories after job loss in the two countries are similar for couple households. However, men in the United States rely relatively more on family resources to overcome income loss, whereas German men's incomes are secured mostly by the welfare state. Women's unemployment in both countries is mainly buffered by their partners' higher earnings. Because single households have no access to family support, they face much higher losses in the United States than in Germany. I also show that the more generous German welfare state triggers less private self-help in the form of increased labor force participation on the part of women when their partners lose their jobs. Over time, the family has become more important in buffering incomes after job loss in the United States which smoothed men's and roughened women's income trajectories in couple households. In Germany, worsening re-employment chances increased income losses in the long run after job loss. "
0,"This article uses Academy Award nominations for acting to explore how artistic achievement is situated within a collaborative context. Assessment of individual effort is particularly difficult in film because quality is not transparent, but the project-based nature of the field allows us to observe individuals in multiple collaborative contexts. We address these issues with analyses of the top-10 credited roles from films released in theaters between 1936 and 2005. Controlling for an actor's personal history and the basic traits of a film, we explore two predictions. First, we find that status, as measured by asymmetric centrality in the network of screen credits, is an efficient measure of star power and mediates the relationship between experience and formal artistic consecration. Second, we find that actors are most likely to be consecrated when working with elite collaborators. We conclude by arguing that selection into privileged work teams provides cumulative advantage."
0,"Both ""welfare culture"" arguments and structural explanations of poverty suggest that attitudes may have an effect on work and welfare outcomes. However, most scholars only examine objective behaviors and characteristics despite the fact that values are an underlying mechanism in explanations of the transmission of welfare and work behavior. Using data from a survey of recent welfare recipients in Louisiana and structural equation methods we analyze causal relationships among family background, socioeconomic characteristics, attitudes, and two outcomes-TANF participation and employment. We find some support for the intergenerational transmission of welfare but not through values; we find no evidence that under the TANF system, values inhibit work. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"This article explores how race and color labels are used to describe people in an Afro-Peruvian community. This article is based on analyses of 88 interviews and 18 months of fieldwork in an African-descended community in Peru. The analyses of these data reveal that, if we consider race and color to be conceptually distinct, there is no ""mulatto escape hatch,"" no social or cultural whitening, and no continuum of racial categories in the black Peruvian community under study. This article considers the implications of drawing a conceptual distinction between race and color for research on racial classifications in Latin America."
0,"This paper considers contradictions embedded in the extension of socioeconomic rights to children in South Africa during the 1990s and 2000s. After apartheid, the scale of poverty and inequality, together with the social disruption of family and kin groups placed child rights at the center of South African constitutional and public policy reform.  However the AIDS pandemic and its likely implications for children brought new dilemmas and policy considerations to the fore.  As childrens policy reform gained momentum, one of the critical dilemmas concerned the definition and legitimation of the category AIDS orphan  and the socioeconomic entitlements that persons so categorized could access.  The late 1990s also marked a retreat from redistributive economic policy to fiscally austere measures.  Child rights activists contested the narrow definition of the AIDS orphan arguing that it privileged a particular group of children while discounting the socioeconomic rights of children in poverty who were not directly affected by AIDS.  The contours of the debate showed interest groups both within state and among non-governmental agencies sympathetic to particular positions.  Building on emerging work on the sociology of  human rights (Somers and Roberts, 2008) I contend that categories such as the orphan, and the development projects that emerge to promote and reproduce these categories, are given form through negotiations among diverse parties."
0,"Sociologists have long been interested in pluralistic ignorance-situations where a majority of individuals assume that most of their peers think differently than themselves when, in fact, their attitudes are similar. Recently, sociologists have suggested that pluralistic ignorance is especially likely to occur when peers are gathered together and may explain why group members often refrain from discussing their ultimate concerns with each other. However, researchers have not indicated what factors besides physical proximity might create pluralistic ignorance. Nor have they employed methods that can specify how causal factors combine to produce multiple routes to pluralistic ignorance. To remedy this situation, this article suggests several factors that may make others' opinions more or less transparent. It also proposes an analytical strategy that can identify which combinations of these factors are associated with misperceptions and illustrates how it might be applied. Implications of this study for future research are discussed."
0,"Based on fifty two interviews, my dissertation is the first major study of how the specific occupational status of a South Asian immigrant group shapes the groups ethnic-racial identity. This group is first and second-generation Indian immigrant doctors in Southern California. As non-white immigrant professionals living and working among diverse populations, these doctors find that their occupational status and class privilege provide only partial, situational protection from racism. The first three chapters, or Part I, of my dissertation shows that outside of their clinical interactions with patients, who respect them as culturally endowed healers, Indian immigrant doctors in Southern California are subject to racist treatment from colleagues, staff, health care institutions, and the general public. In Part II, or the last three chapters, I explain that the particular forms of prejudice and discrimination they face, as well as how they interpret these instances of prejudice and discrimination in racial terms, have as much to do with their immigrant generation, their gender, and their experiences outside of the U.S., as with their professional class status. My dissertation, therefore, contributes to the fields of Asian American Studies and Immigration Studies, both of which have, thus far, focused primarily on the racial-ethnic identity formation of economically disadvantaged non-white groups, under the assumption that professional Asian immigrants class status and occupations in the sciences effectively shield them from racist harm and preclude their engagement in racial politics."

0,"The rising female advantage in postsecondary enrollment has garnered attention by academic researchers, public policy makers, and the media alike.  We argue that there are several reasons to believe that the female advantage might vary across geographic context.  We use the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) and a detailed measure of urbanicity to investigate whether the female advantage in college enrollment varies across levels of urbanicity.  We observe differences in the existence and  size of the female advantage across urban and rural contexts.  Unexpectedly, we find evidence of a female disadvantage  in four-year college-going in some areas.  Our findings ultimately highlight the importance of contextualizing gender differences in education by the places that structure labor market opportunities and circumscribe gender roles and appropriate pathways to adulthood for boys and girls."
0,"In this paper, I propose an extension of identity theory and self esteem.  I posit ethnic identity as a parallel process to identity theory and propose a model that taps into the existing identity model.  I discuss literature on ethnic identity, identity theory, and the self to both bring integration to the literature and draw attention to the unique processes and societal pressures minority individuals, primarily youth, undergo when forming identities.  I also discuss past methodological issues and suggest reliable instruments to accurately measure these issues for minority individuals."
0,"We investigate the turnover effects of an organizational innovation (ROWE-Results Only Work Environment) aimed at moving away from standard time practices to focus on results rather than time spent at work. To model rates of turnover, we draw on survey data from a sample of employees at a corporate headquarters (N = 775) and institutional records of turnover over eight months following the ROWE implementation. We find the odds of turnover are indeed lower for employees participating in the ROWE initiative, which offers employees greater work-time control and flexibility and that this is the case regardless of employees gender, age, or family life stage. ROWE also moderates the turnover effects of organizational tenure and negative home-to-work spillover, physical symptoms, and job insecurity with those in ROWE who report these situations generally less likely to leave the organization. Additionally ROWE reduces turnover intentions among those remaining with the corporation. This research moves the ""opting-out"" argument from one of private troubles to an issue of greater employee work-time control and flexibility by showing that an organizational policy initiative can reduce turnover."
0,"This paper examines the impact of market forces on the process of status attainment for college graduates in China in the 1990s. Status is indicated by the administrative level of graduates work unit. A representative sample of college graduates is analyzed and two distinct models of status attainment are identified for male and female students. For male graduates, educational attainment, key middle school attendance, enrollment categories and subject areas are key predictors of status attainment. For female graduates, educational attainment, key middle school attendance and family location are key predictors for status attainment. Changes consistent with the market reform are detected together with the persistence of old institutional barrier."
0,"Based on in-depth, life-history interviews of inter-racially married, professional Asian Americans and their spouses in Chicago, this article explores the dynamics of the making and negotiation of ethnic-racial identity/ culture among second-generation Asian Americans.  In the classic assimilationist perspective, intermarriage has been seen as a barometer of assimilation.  Through a detailed examination of how ethnic-racial identities evolve and come to matter for these Asian American “boundary crossers” as they marry and begin to raise children, this study shows that intermarriage, far from being an unproblematic indicator of assimilation, is a terrain in which complex subjective negotiations over ethnic/racial identity are waged.  A central finding of this article is that even given their embeddeness within current multicultural and color-blind discourses, particularly as members of a “model minority” group, race matters; not only are the selfhoods, intimate desires, and marital choices of the participants shaped centrally by their location within the system of racial stratification, but their long-standing ambivalence toward their ethnic identity/culture on the one hand, and toward their desire for white privilege on the other, becomes projected onto their mixed-raced children who, in their bi-raciality, come to embody and symbolize this tension, as well as hopes for overcoming such tension.   Furthermore, this paper contributes to research on the interrelationship between Asian American intermarriage, identity development, and race by comparing the perspectives and feelings of Asian Americans and their non-Asian spouses, which helps to illuminate the distinctiveness of the Asian-American experience."
0,"We investigate the association between a subjective measure of social status and the reasons for immigration among Asian immigrants in the US. We use data from the National Latino and Asian American Study to test several hypotheses about this association. Our analyses show the positive effect on perceived social standing of migrating for better education, the negative effect of migrating to seek employment, and the negative impact of refugee status. Migrating for family reunification can be associated with various circumstances, which lead to differing outcomes. The results suggest that the notion that immigrants arrive in the US with limited resources and few skills and move slowly up the socioeconomic ladder must be reassessed in light of the complex social context and factors such as ethnicity, gender, divergent immigration paths, and a range of associated circumstances.

0,"Previous studies in the market transition debate tended to focus on the returns to human capital and political capital to infer the changing stratification mechanisms. This article brings the class back into the analysis of changing order social stratification in China’s economic transition since 1978.  We develop a Chinese class schema based on the unique socialist institutions such as the household registration (hukou), the work unit (danwei), the cadre-worker distinction, and the emerging of private ownership of the means of production in China’s transition economy, which, in a neo-Marxian perspective, are associated with different forms of productive assets: labor power, organization, capital, and authority/skills. We argue that China’s momentum of changing inequality is associated with the shifting effect of the exploitative/accumulative capacity of the ownership of these four production assets. It suggests that the institutional changes from 1978 undermined the hukou and danwei distinction while strengthened the ownership of means of production and the exploitative capacity of cadres. According to the consistent statistical evidences from the national surveys conducted between 1988 and 2005, we conclude that the correspondent changes of the institutional arrangements have led to proletarianization of class structure and deterioration of class inequality in China."
0,"Using identity theory, this research focuses on the effects of reflected appraisals and self-esteem on the self-view. Reflected appraisals represent the way an individual thinks others view the self when performing an identity. This study demonstrates that ones level of self-esteem is an influential component of the perceptual lens through which reflected appraisals are incorporated into the self. Data is collected from a population of incarcerated criminal offenders with respect to the criminal identity. Analyses reveal that subjects with high self-esteem claim a non-salient criminal identity when they report reflected appraisals of their peers with whom they are incarcerated, or guards at the jail as being high for the criminal identity. Alternatively, those with low self-esteem claim a salient criminal identity when reporting that reflected appraisals of peers and guards are high for the criminal identity. This means that subjects with high self-esteem were less likely to incorporate the reflected appraisals of these others into their identity than subjects with low self-esteem. The findings suggest that the self-view is a result of both external (reflected appraisals) and internal (self-esteem) forces."
0,"From 1959 to 1965, sixteen states outside the South passed laws prohibiting discrimination in private housing markets. Why did some states pass fair housing laws earlier than other states, and why did some states fair to pass such laws altogether? This paper tests a new theory that white backlash and Republican hostility delayed the passage of fair housing laws in the late-1950s and early-1960s. Applying event-history methods to a newly assembled data set on the states, it finds modest evidence that the likelihood of passage varies directly with Republican control of state government, even while controlling for other variables associated with policy innovation. It does not appear that the likelihood of passage varies in any statistically significant way with the percent of state residents who are black. However, does appear that the mobilization of the civil rights movement does have a strong, independent, and direct effect on the chances that a state will pass fair housing legislation. The implications of the finding for theories of race and the party system are discussed. If there was a major electoral realignment in the late-1960in which Republican elites and masses grew increasingly conservative on racial issuesit did not entirely originate with the advent of affirmative action, busing, and other race-attentive policies. In the battle over state housing legislation in the North, it appears that the party  of Lincoln stood against the civil rights movement to block the extension of civil rights to African Americans."
0,"The theory of relative deprivation emphasizes that social comparisons contextualize how people experience impoverishment. An important application of this theory argues that relative deprivation that stems from unfavorable social comparisons can result in anger, normlessness and an increased likelihood of deviant behavior. We test this theory in a new societal setting-Iceland. Specifically, we test the proposition that the effects of economic deprivation on individual outcomes are contingent on: the standard of living enjoyed by the person's reference groups: Using multilevel data on 5,491 Icelandic adolescents in 83 school-communities, we find consistent support for the theory. We show that the effects of economic deprivation on adolescent anger, normlessness, delinquency, violence and subjective relative family status are weak in school-communities where economic deprivation is common, while the effects are significantly stronger in school-communities where economic deprivation is rare."
0,"In the modern global economy, firms frequently face pressures to move certain corporate functions abroad in order to take advantage of lower production costs and tap into new emerging markets for their products and services. Using data from an exploratory fieldwork in Taiwanese computer industry, this paper examines how corporate and social network changed in situations when the industry moved production processes offshore. The findings suggest that companies migrated with their suppliers and maintained a close relationship in order to cope with the uncertainty they encountered during the relocation to China. Yet a high degree of market uncertainty also motivated manufacturers to withdraw from their obligations to the suppliers and back away from exclusive partnerships. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications of the resulting closer but less committed supplier relationships after the business relocation."
0,"We evaluate the importance of judgments about work for the attainment process in the ""new economy."" Findings show continuing links between social origins and work orientations at age 21/22, as well as significant effects of work orientations on occupational outcomes at age 31/32. Higher socio-economic status background, and stronger self-perceived ability, are tied to weaker extrinsic orientations. Young women are more intrinsically oriented than young men. Stronger intrinsic orientations predict holding jobs that offer more intrinsic rewards, self-direction and security. Stronger extrinsic orientations predict higher biweekly earnings (largely via work hours), but not more prestigious, better paying or more secure jobs. Judgments about work, and especially intrinsic orientations, thus remain important precursors of occupational attainments, despite economic turbulence and change in the transition to adulthood."

0,"Military expenditures have escalated over the last three decades in both developed and less developed countries, without a corresponding expansion of military personnel. Spending has instead been directed towards hi-tech weaponry, what we refer to as the ""new"" military. We hypothesize that this new, increasingly capital-intensive military is no longer a pathway of upward mobility or employer of last resort for many uneducated, unskilled, or unemployed people, with significant consequences for those individuals and society as a whole. One such consequence, we argue, is an increase in income inequality. We test this hypothesis with cross-national panel models, estimated for 82 developed and less developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Findings indicate that military capital-intensiveness, as measured by military expenditures per soldier, exacerbates income inequality net of control variables. Neither total military expenditures/GDP nor military participation has a significant effect. It appears from these findings that today's ""new"" military establishment is abrogating its historical role as an equalizing force in society, with important policy implications. "
0,"By developing the concept of ''gastronationalism,'' this article challenges conceptions of the homogenizing forces of globalism. I analyze (1) the ways in which food production, distribution, and consumption can demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attachment and (2) how nationalist sentiments, in turn, can shape the production and marketing of food. The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics-politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case-the politics surrounding foie gras in France-demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization."
0,"This article examines why some black Southerners but not others were politically active during the early stages of the civil rights movement. Using a survey of more than 600 black Southerners in 1961, we investigate whether perceptions about opportunity and threat, politicized social capital and individual orientations toward social change shaped voting in the 1960 Presidential election. Perceptions of solidarity in the black community and repression against politically active blacks encourage voting, while the perception of white support for integration does not. Participating in civic and religious organizations and discussing politics with friends and co-workers (but not family members) increase the likelihood of voting. Our findings extend political opportunity and social capital theories in important ways while offering new insights into this historically important case of civic engagement."
0,"The university advancement rate for Japanese women rose between 1992 and 2009 from 17% to 44%.  The increase in higher education participation does not necessarily translate into women’s greater labor force attachment. The present study examines the factors related to job separation of Japanese female workers with university-level education.  Data was collected from 1,407 women aged 28 to 47 years who achieved higher education qualifications.  The focus of the study is on separation from the first job after completion of education.  Quitting the first job is an event experienced by the majority of highly-educated female workers in Japan.  In our data, 1,047 women (77.8%) have experienced a job separation.  The average duration of the first job is 4.15 years.  Our research problem is why highly educated female workers experience a job separation.  Prior research has suggested that marriage and childbirth are key factors in first job separation.  Drawing on the literature, we postulate that factors not directly related to marriage and childbirth are predictive of job separations as well.  Data analysis confirms that marriage and childbirth remain main reasons behind job separation. In addition, it finds that highly educated female workers leave their jobs because of disagreeable working conditions."
0,"In this paper, I compare the newspaper attention to social movement organizations (SMOs) during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of the last few years.   There are two main differences.   The 1930s marked a major break with previous attention to (and activity of) SMOs, as coverage and activity increased dramatically.   In our initial analyses, the period starting in 2009 also marked a break, if not as significant with previous coverage and activity.  More important, the 1930s were characterized by extensive non-right-wing movement activity, notably by the labor movement, the veterans’ movement, and the old-age pension movement, each of which made demands on the state for greater security, rights, or protection.   By contrast, the current period witnessed an upsurge of right-wing activity, as well as some increased activity by movements such as LGBT rights and the environmental movement.   Some main contrasts are between the Tea Party movement of the current period, the American Liberty League, which gained little traction in the Depression with similar backing and goals, and the Townsend Plan, which gained great traction and attention with similar patriotic themes, though attached to a program that sought greatly to expand government financial protections to the citizenry.   However, despite their great level of attention, the Tea Party movement has received far more favorable attention in the media than the Townsend Plan.  The paper addresses movement, media, and political sociology arguments surrounding economics, partisanship, organizational strength, policy choices, and the media environment to delineate and explain these differences."
0,"This research compares representations of rap music with the self-reported criminal behavior and resistant attitudes of the Musics core audience. Our database is a large sample of Toronto high school Students (n = 3,393) from which we identify a group of listeners, whose combination of musical likes and dislikes distinguish them as rap univores. W then examine the relationship between their cultural preference for rap music and involvement in a Culture of crime and their perceptions of social injustice and inequity. We find that the rap univores, also known as urban music enthusiasts, report significantly more delinquent behavior and stronger feelings of inequity and injustice than listeners with other musical tastes. However, we also find that the nature and strengths of those relationships vary according to the racial identity of different groups within urban music enthusiasts. Black and white subgroups align themselves with resistance representations while Asians do not; whites and Asians report significant involvement in crime and delinquency, while blacks do not. Finally, we discuss our findings in light of research on media effects and audience reception, youth Subcultures and post-subcultural analysis, and the sociology Of Cultural consumption."
0,"The aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework for thinking more clearly about the role of resources and resource mobilization in generating strategic capacity for social movements; i.e., the capacity to develop and utilize repertoires of collective action.  Our starting point is the observation that, despite the fundamental importance of the concept of resources in social movement theory , a lack of conceptual clarity around the concept is widely acknowledged. Our aim, therefore, is to develop a framework for conceptualizing resources and capabilities within the resource mobilization tradition within SMT.  We do so by taking up the suggestion of Davis, McAdam, Scott and Zald (2005) to look at the potential for greater dialogue between SMT and organization theory, where concerns about informal processes within organizations parallel many of the concerns of social movement theorists.  We show how Rresourve-based view (RBV) of the firm might contribute towards SMT by identifying some of the insights from RBV theory that may enrich and challenge existing approaches to the study of resources in social movements.  In particular, we elaborate how the RBV theory can shed light on the way resources relate to collective action repertoires through the creation of capabilities and strategic capacity."
0,"Religious individuals commonly make sizable monetary sacrifices by contributing to their congregations. This social action resides in the overlap of religious and economic realms of behavior, creating a certain tension. Following a Weberian approach to social inquiry, I treat religious giving as social action whereby individuals direct their value-rational and instrumental-rational behavior towards others. Using data from the American Congregational Giving Survey and the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, I test hypotheses derived from a rational choice perspective, the sense of solidarity one feels, and from the religious meaning of the giver. Rational choice hypotheses produce mixed results, the solidarity impact is confirmed, and high levels of religiosity have a strong impact on giving."
0,"Research on the emotional consequences of interactive service work remains inconclusive in large part because scholars have not analyzed the mechanisms that lead frontline employees to adopt the meanings disseminated by their employers. The authors argue that the theoretical framework best suited for remedying this situation is the negotiated order perspective. It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate-sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy-set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff. Consistent with expectations, findings show that employees can embrace the same corporate-sanctioned meaning under different sets of conditions and with different emotional consequences."
0,"Family wealth has long been recognized as a source of economic security, privilege, and socioeconomic status (SES) both at the individual and family level. In the past social stratification and inequality research, however, wealth studies have not gained as much vibrancy as labor market activities, demanding more sociological work to move beyond descriptive work on wealth and aim to measure the effect of wealth holdings on ones socioeconomic behavior. This study attempts to bridge the gap in the existing wealth literature focusing on the possible buffer effect of family wealth on its members welfare at the time of economic hardship. Employing the case of South Korea since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, we estimate a multilevel model with repeated observations on household living expenses and various household wealth measures to examine the buffer effect of family wealth on the household socioeconomic well-being under the last decade of neoliberal restructuring in South Korea. The statistical results do support the buffer effect hypothesis demonstrating the significance of household wealth to manage through the time of economic difficulties. Further implications of family wealth are discussed with policy suggestions."
0,"Previous studies suggest that there are strong differences in the rates of youth poverty across European countries. Rather surprisingly, it is found to be high in Scandinavian countries, and relatively speaking, lower in Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries. This somewhat unexpected finding prompts the question whether the incidence of poverty is an appropriate measure of youth disadvantage. Instead of considering poverty rates we consider the length of recorded poverty spells, taking into account explicitly the temporal sequencing of the episodes of poverty. Using the European Community Household Panel, individuals are classified into different groups of poverty permanence, each reflecting severity of social disadvantage. Based on these categories we implement a generalized ordinal logit model to assess the various factors associated with social disadvantage among youth. We find that cross-national patterns differ from those found in previous studies. In particular from our findings it does not result that poverty is highest among young people in Social Democratic countries. Our analysis shows important gender differences, though they are not the same across the countries included in the study. For some countries it turns out that being a woman is a protective factor against long-term poverty. As previous studies suggests, young individuals' living arrangements matter. "
0,"China's post-1978 economic reform has led to fundamental changes in its urban life. Yet little attention has been paid to the effects of this massive societal transformation on individuals' psychological well-being. Using survey data collected from a national sample of 3,443 Chinese urban residents in 2005, I examine the effects of employment conditions, political affiliation, and regional level of marketization on self-reported symptoms of psychological distress. The findings show that individuals whose personal conditions expose them more to the risks and uncertainty brought about by market reform, such as self-employed workers, are more likely to suffer from psychological distress. By contrast, residents in more marketized areas tend to feel more satisfied with their economic conditions and therefore have lower levels of distress. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduced social protection resulting from reform contributes to an elevated level of psychological distress. However, a higher perceived level of economic well-being reduces distress and partly compensates for the disruptive effects of China's market transition."

The results suggest that parents who work nonstandard evening hours spend less time in some child-related activities than their counterparts who work standard daytime hours, but spend more time and more time alone with children. Married parents who work nonstandard hours spend less time with a spouse, and all parents with nonstandard hours get less sleep and watch less television than parents with standard work days."
0,"Online teaching has grown substantially over the last decade, with further increases predicted.  Universities are pursuing online education in order to manage increasing numbers of students and to control costs.  Although the literature often suggests that learning outcomes are similar for online and traditional classes, there has been insufficient research on this point using rigorous controls, and it is also unclear as to who selects online as compared with traditional classes.  We report results from a study of two classes covering the sociology of work and family taught at NCSU in Fall 2009, where one section was taught online and the other face-to-face.  Although a few of the online students were ""non-traditional,"" the majority were traditional NCSU students needing schedule flexibility. The students also report different learning styles.  A content assessment suggested similar learning across the two sections, although grades for the online students were slightly lower than for the students who learned face-to-face."
0,"In 1995, the University of California was first prohibited from employing affirmative action principles in student admissions.  In response to this prohibition, the UC sought to pursue a number of alternative avenues for promoting the selection and retention of a diverse student body.  In this paper, we draw from textual archival records of over 750 organizational agencies and programs related to outreach efforts across the University of California system to examine the emergence of alternative rationales and strategies of identifying and recruiting a diverse student body while staying within the constraints imposed by legal mandate.  To accomplish this, we conduct a textual analysis with the application of  Galois lattice techniques and in so doing unpack a dually ordered system of identity categories and institutional practices that are embedded in the organizational texts and that form the framework for a new organizational logic of outreach."
0,"This paper examines the differential achievement of school-aged children of immigrants who arrived in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s compared with children of native parents.  The data come from the Immigrant Refresher supplement to the 1997 Panel Study of Income Dynamics and Child Development Supplement, including time diaries, for these children and their families in 1997 and 2003.  In spite of their greater socioeconomic disadvantage and their greater use of native languages at home, children of immigrant parents (first or second generation) achieve at levels at least equal to those of children of native parents.  In the case of vocabulary, they actually surpass the achievement of their third generation peers, achieving 6 points higher on the vocabulary test, an effect size of about 33%.  Children of immigrants spend more time studying and watching television, and less time playing video games and sports.  Children’s activities mediate some of the effect of generation but home language use also does not explain generational differences. Generational differences in achievement are primarily socioeconomic differences; controlling for socioeconomic status eliminates the differences across generations in reading and problem-solving but, in the case of vocabulary, results in the first and second generations achieving more than the third.  Immigrant values and beliefs remain important sources of generational achievement differences even after socioeconomic status is controlled."
0,"This study examines contemporary trends in Black Church adult participation and whether and how patterns are influenced by factors such as denomination, location, church and clergy profile, church environment, and programmatic efforts. Bivariate and ordered logit results based on Faith Factor 2000 Project data across seven denominations suggest minimal denominational influence; however, church environment, including worship features and sermonic emphasis, as well as varied programs, positively influence participation. Additionally, participation decline is apparent among rural congregations. Results help illumine profiles of Black churches most likely to experience high or low levels of participation."
0,"The inclusion of women in the US. military is generally understood as radically transforming traditional gender relations. Drawing from 38 interviews with women and men in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, I ask: how do women negotiate gender identities within the ""masculine"" military institution, and what types of transformations in their gender ideology and practices does this negotiation entail? I find that ROTC women's transformative agency is limited by the cultural imperative of performing gender. That is, because their very identities as women are called into question in the military sphere, ROTC women must privilege traditionally feminine aspects of themselves in order to maintain a coherent sense of self. Through this process, these women ultimately reproduce traditional femininity and male privilege."
0,"Based on a one-year collaborative ethnography of civil society groups in Providence, Rhode Island, a medium-size American city, we explore the landscape of new civil society organizations organized around ideas of innovation, openness, and borrowing ideas from the business world.  We focus on two organizations, Engage and Open Space and describe their practices and imaginations for a better city.  These ‘civic innovators’ seek to renew civic life and improve government functioning through technological solutions, business-like innovations (like crowd-sourcing and “killer apps”), and specific forms of civil (non-partisan and non-conflictive) participation.  We argue that while the sentiment for reform among these activists is genuine, and indeed attempts to inject transparency and openness into government, the impact of their politics lies ultimately in what they do not permit.  By drawing a line between civil and non-civil participation and by denying that there are problems beyond a technical fix, the language of civic innovation disallows discussion of power, inequality, justice, or redistribution.  We argue this is an American version of the post-political condition described for Europe by scholars like Zizek, Rancière, and Mouffe."
0,"Household wealth is extremely unequally distributed. While facts about the distribution of wealth are readily available, less is known about the family dynamics that underlie this important component of inequality. An increasing number of households are single female households (both never married and divorced), and the number of single mothers among these households has grown in recent decades. This paper explores differences in wealth by marital status, gender, and single parenthood. We focus on young baby boomers, a generation that witnessed unprecedented educational and occupational opportunities for women and that has been entering their peak wealth ownership years in recent decades. We argue that there will be minimal gender differences among never-married people in this cohort. However, we also propose that single mothers and fathers will be economically disadvantaged compared to their peers who do not have children. Our analyses provide support for these arguments. We find the greatest gap in wealth between single mothers and single females with no children. We also find that single mothers accumulate the fewest assets overall. These findings provide insight into the effect of gender and marriage on financial well-being, and they also isolate ways that adult family processes impede saving and asset accumulation."
0,"This article examines social stratification in individual health trajectories for multiple cohorts in the context of China's dramatically changing macro-social environment. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find significant socioeconomic status (SES) differences in the mean level of health and that these SES differentials generally diverge over the life course. We also find strong cohort variations in SES disparities in the mean levels of health and health trajectories. The effect of education on health slightly decreases across successive cohorts. By contrast, the income gap in health trajectories diverges for earlier cohorts but converges for most recent cohorts. Both effects are more pronounced in rural areas. Given that these cohort effects are opposite those reported in recent U.S. studies, we discuss China's unique social, economic, and political settings. We highlight the association between SES and health behaviors, China's stage of epidemiologic transition, and the changing power of the state government and its implications for health care."
0,"This study examines the extent to which geographic variation in Food Stamp Program (FSP) participation is explained by place-based factors, with special attention to the case of the three poorest regions of the United States: Central Appalachia, the Texas Borderland, and the Lower Mississippi Delta. We use descriptive statistics and regression models to assess the prevalence and correlates of county-level FSP participation circa 2005. Our findings show that the economic distress that has long characterized Appalachia, the Borderland, and the Delta clearly translates into greater reliance on the FSP relative to other areas of the country. State-level effects and local-level variations in poverty, labor market conditions, population structure, human capital, and residential context explain much of this reality. Yet, even after taking all of these factors into account, these regional geographies remain home to particularly high FSP participation. Our findings underscore the importance of considering these regions as key cases of study in the stratification of American society and hold a variety of implications for public policy. "
0,"People’s movement between social contacts throughout the day, and the ever-changing microsocial environment it creates, is fundamental to microinteractional processes like symbolic interaction as well as macrosocial phenomena such as diffusion (which is impossible without individuals’ movement between contacts). For individuals, switching behavior increases their influence over the flow of information and resources through networks, gives them opportunities to exercise and manage multiple identities, and enhances their proficiency with microinteractional strategies. Despite these implications, we know very little about the frequency with which switching behavior actually occurs, or who engages in it most often. I use nationally representative data from 85,620 respondents’ 24-hour time diaries – collected in the 2003-2008 American Time Use Surveys (ATUSs) – to examine these issues. Negative binomial regression analyses reveal that switching occurs more frequently among younger adults, people who are married, those who have children, and employed individuals. Beyond this, frequent transit and time spent away from home is central to the genesis of new interaction contexts. I discuss the implications of these findings for interactionist and social network frameworks."
0,"Some would argue that religion and peace are synonymous or that religion promotes and purports the essence of peace.  This notion, however, can be challenged when taking a closer look at the use of religion.  The view of peace and religion is more encompassing than simply believing that religion brings about peace.  Focusing on the District of Columbia, this study seeks to discover to what degree religion can be used as a peacebuilding tool, a peacekeeping tool, and whether or not residents of the District perceive interfaith dialogue to be a tool in promoting peace.  A telephone survey was conducted in 2008 of District of Columbia residents.  A slight majority of the respondents were female (52%) while 30.9% were male, a majority of the respondents were Black/African American, 54.5%, while 24.4% responded as White/European American, 4.9% responded other, and this information was missing for 16.3% of the respondents. Overwhelmingly the data have shown that religion is perceived to be a tool of peace in all three areas."
0,"This paper draws on recently developed historical GDP estimates on five centuries of European economic growth (1500-2000) to revisit the Protestant Ethic thesis. After the Reformation, Protestant regions arose from the backwaters of Europe to displace the Catholic countries as the economic powerhouses. By 1700  prior to the full-fledged industrial revolution  Protestant countries had overtaken the Catholic world in terms of income. A strong Protestant-Catholic income gap became well established over the next 250 years. There were no signs of convergence until the 1960s. This is not, however, a simple vindication of the Protestant ethic thesis. After discussing the empirical data, I explore a number of alternative hypotheses that might account for the economic dominance of Protestant Europe. They include (1) secularization  freeing the economy from religious controls; (2) the growth of education (and the Protestant emphasis on literacy  ability to read the bible); (3) the dismal consequences of the Catholic Counter-Reformation; (4) the importance of the Atlantic (slave) trade in creating an autonomous business class that would demand modernizing institutional reforms."
0,"Why have African-American private-sector unionization rates surpassed those of white workers for decades, and how has private-sector union decline exacerbated black-white wage inequality? Using data from the Current Population Survey (1973-2007), the authors show that African-Americans join unions for protection against discriminatory treatment in nonunion sectors. A model-predicted wage series also shows that, among women, black-white weekly wage gaps would be between 13% and 30% lower if union representation remained at high levels. The effect of deunionization on racial wage inequality for men is less substantial, but without deunionization, weekly wages for black men would be an estimated $49 higher. The results recast organized labor as an institution vital for its economic inclusion of African-American men and women. This study points to the need to move beyond class-based analyses of union decline to an understanding of the gendered role unions once played in mitigating racial inequality."
0,"A great deal of research has attempted to disentangle the myriad ways in which young, black men are disadvantaged in the post-industrial labor market. This scholarship has documented demand-size factors such as the growing gap between prospective workers skills and available employment, racially-segregated job networks, and differential search strategies. Recently, research has pointed to the importance of supply-side explanations, such as the spatial mismatch between inner-city job seekers and good-paying jobs, heightened and changing skill requirements, increased reliance on informal hiring strategies and face-to-face interviews, use of criminal background checks, and employer preferences for certain racial/ ethnic and gender groups in the form of statistical discrimination. Lacking in the literature is a review and analysis of the earliest stage in the hiring process - the job application - and how it can be an additional barrier to employment.  We remedy this by documenting the application procedures of 125 retailers in the Philadelphia region.  We find a large proportion of employers exclusively using electronic as opposed to traditional paper applications.  Further, nearly all electronic applications require the applicant to complete lengthy pre-employment screening questionnaires that measure hard and soft skills, past work performance, and attitudes and values, among other domains.  We contend that the increased, and presumably increasing, use of electronic applications is a further disadvantage to inner-city black males because of their lack of access to and familiarity with the computers, the increased time investment in completing such applications, and the possibility of culturally-biased items contained in pre-employment screening questionnaires."
0,"Research shows that the strength of a workers social network ties and the value of social resources accrued from those ties help explain poor job outcomes. Yet scholars have neglected to adequately examine the sex composition of the social network or the quality of jobs attained. We use a subsample of low income mothers using informal job search methods from The Philadelphia Survey of Child Care and Work to test the hypothesis that an all-female social network increases the likelihood of a service sector job. Women are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs in the service economy characterized by low pay and fewer opportunities for upward mobility. We find that all-female social networks significantly increase the probability of low-wage service work by 12%, worsening womens life chances."
0,"In this study, we investigate how structural economic changes constrain an equality project, the public-sector expansion strategy. First, we describe a three-stage process in which a growing productivity gap between the private-manufacturing and public-service sectors disrupts traditional class solidarity. We contend that emerging conflicts between private and public sectors due to public-sector expansion and a growing inter-sectoral productivity gap eventually lead to employment and budget crises, as well as the weakening of coordinated wage-setting institutions. Furthermore, political, institutional, and economic transformations originating from sectoral cleavages and imbalance lead to increased income inequality. We test this argument using an unbalanced panel dataset on 16 advanced industrial democracies from 1971 to 2003. We find that public-sector employment has a strong negative effect on income inequality when the productivity gap between sectors is low. In such situations, public-sector employment fulfills its promise of equality and full employment. However, as the inter-sectoral productivity gap increases, the negative effect of public-sector expansion on income inequality evaporates. The findings suggest that severely uneven productivity gaps due to different degrees of technological innovations significantly weaken and limit the effectiveness of left-wing governments' policy interventions through public-service expansion."
0,"In spite of the fact that more than 10 percent of Americans claim no religion, academic investigations of the ""nones"" represent an underdeveloped area in the sociology of religion. We find that people with religiously unaffiliated parents and those who attended religious services less as a child are more likely to claim no religion. In addition, we find a strong association between having a spouse and peer group that are non-religious and claiming no religion."
0,"Large corporations have incorporated progressive social ideas into their marketing, a practice scholars have amply mined.  Few though have focused on how individuals think and feel when they see their politics appropriated by corporations.  Do people appreciate seeing their grass-roots views amplified on a large scale, or do they see these corporate incarnations as crass, manipulative, and politically harmful? Do activists resent that personal ideals are being peddled to sell products, or do they think that corporations can play a positive role in the dissemination of social movement ideals?  The answers to questions such as these can help clarify how corporate appropriation of movement ideals affects political consciousness. In this paper, we focus on Unilever Corporation’s use of feminism to sell Dove brand products, drawing on focus groups with young, feminist-identified women to analyze their understandings of this campaign and its larger implications for social change-making. We frame our analysis around a key concern of the Frankfurt school theorist, Herbert Marcuse: the foreclosure of critique, which he termed the “convergence of opposites,” or the dialectical tension between social critique and capitalist incorporation, indicating both its current relevance and possibilities for extension."
0,"During the 1960s and 70s the United States environmental movement experienced dramatic growth in both absolute size and in the diversity of organizational structures and issues represented within the movement. We assess the importance Of change in movement size and compositional diversity on two important stages within the legislative process. Findings indicate that U.S. environmental movement size is positively associated with the incidence of Congressional environmental agenda-setting activities, but not the passage of environmental laws. An increased diversity of issue representation within the movement is consistently and positively associated with the incidence of agenda setting and law-passage activity. The growth of EMOs attending simultaneously to both traditional conservation and ""new"" quality of life issues, in particular, is associated with elevated rates of policy activity."
0,"This paper about the important institution of motherhood focuses on immigrant mothers and their experiences playing that role in a society foreign from the one in which they learned it. As institutions are collectively perceived and enforced, the paper discusses the macro and micro factors of immigration as they impact motherhood. It looks at the process of acculturation and the lack of support systems as relevant macro factors and also touches on micro factors like quality of marital relationship, husbands involvement, the impact of parallel socialization, language and job skills and the mental health of the mother."
0,"Recent actor-centric theory about the historical rise of capitalism emphasizes the role of the autonomous agrarian elite in fostering a sustained agricultural revolution. This revolution generated ample agrarian surplus, in the form of rural elite elevated income, to fuel a capitalist-industrial takeoff in late-eighteenth-century England. The nontransition to capitalism in eighteenth-and nineteenth-century China, despite the vast surplus generated in its advanced agrarian sector shows that high agricultural productivity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a capitalist takeoff. By comparing Qing China with eighteenth-century England, where capitalist industrialization erupted spontaneously, and nineteenth-century Japan, where capitalist industrialization succeeded under intensive state sponsorship, this article argues that a strong urban entrepreneurial elite, capable of centralizing the agrarian surplus and investing it in productive industrial innovation, were as important as the existence of the surplus itself in fomenting capitalist transition. The reproduction of the elite in eighteenth-century China was constrained, not by the anticommercial ""oriental despotic"" state as presumed in earlier literature, but by the state paternalist disposition in managing urban class conflict. Capitalist-industrial development in China was further impeded in the nineteenth century, when a nexus of local predatory-military elite emerged in response to millenarian uprisings and wasted most of the agrarian surplus in their accumulation of means of violence. The negative case of China helps us advance the actor-centric model of capitalist transition by bringing urban entrepreneurs and class politics back in."
0,"While some U.S. corporations have adopted a host of diversity management programs, many have done little or nothing. We explore the forces promoting six diversity programs in a national sample of 816 firms over 23 years. Institutional theory suggests that external pressure for innovation reinforces internal advocacy. We argue that external pressure and internal advocacy serve as alternatives, such that when external pressure is already high, increases in internal advocacy will not alter the likelihood of program adoption. Moreover, institutional theory points to functional need as a driver of innovation. We argue that in the case of innovations designed to achieve new societal goals, functional need, as defined in this case by the absence of workforce diversity or the presence of regulatory oversight, is less important than corporate culture. Our findings help explain the spotty coverage of diversity programs. Firms that lack workforce diversity are no more likely than others to adopt programs, but firms with large contingents of women managers are more likely to do so. Pro-diversity industry and corporate cultures promote diversity programs. The findings carry implications for public policy."
0,"Although a growing number of American parents work non-standard schedules, evidence on the consequences of such working patterns is inconsistent and limited to married samples. This study highlights the importance of considering potential differences between cohabiting and married parents in terms of the relationship between non-standard work schedules and parental well-being. Based on pooled data from the 1997 and 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce (n = 2346), we find that in contrast to married parents who experience some positive associations of non-standard schedules and parental well-being, cohabiting parents are more likely to experience a negative relationship between non-standard work schedules and parental well-being. Additionally, for cohabiting parents (but not married), non-standard work schedules are related to increased work-family conflict, which is in turn associated with lower levels of parental well-being.

0,"The social context in which youth come of age has changed significantly in the last few decades.  Youth of today experience longer periods of economic dependence, increased educational requirements, more family disruption, and a more extensive array of socialization agents (e.g. cable TV, the Internet).  However, it is unclear how these social changes may have affected adolescents and their effort to navigate through important identity and intimacy challenges.  There is very little, if any, in-depth longitudinal data which speak to these issues.  However, teen movies provide a unique window into the adolescent experience and how it may have changed over time.  The present study offers a qualitative analysis of the portrayal of adolescents in teen movies (twenty-four movies) over the last thirty years.  Four key issue areas are examined: adolescent/parent relationships, peer relationships, sex and romantic love, and identity development (maturity and coming of age). Results reveal that the portrayal of peer and romantic relationships has seen little change in the last three decades.  However, there were dramatic differences in the portrayal of teen/parent relationships and in the development of identity and pursuit of adult status.   These changes simultaneously present a portrait of adolescents as having more freedom and autonomy (more adult-like status) but more confused as to their identities and more hesitant to define themselves as adults"
0,"In transitional economies, the scale of economic enterprise and the allocation of property rights shape social structures and influence income distribution. In agrarian economies, where labor-intensive family enterprises dominate, political officials' income advantages decline rapidly relative to those of private entrepreneurs. Larger enterprises, however provide greater income opportunities for officials, especially when a government retains an ownership stake in the initial phases of reform. This article replicates the findings from an earlier study of rural China using comparable survey data from Vietnam. We find that during the first two decades of rural market reform in Vietnam and China, the scale and ownership of firms differed radically. Small family enterprises dominated rural development in Vietnam, whereas China development was dominated by larger firms, initially established by rural governments. Consequently, while cadre income advantages have kept pace with those of private entrepreneurs in China, they have declined rapidly in Vietnam."
0,"Although numerous studies have documented the long-term consequences of childhood victimization on various indicators of adult health, very few studies have considered the lasting effects of violence experiences in adulthood. Extending prior research, we examine the long-term effects of relationship violence in adulthood on the health of low-income urban women. Using data from the Welfare, Children, and Families project (1999, 2001), a probability sample of 2,402 low-income women with children living in low-income neighborhoods in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we predict overall psychological distress, heavy drinking, and self-rated health over two years with baseline survey responses, which include multiple measures of relationship violence, a wide range of sociodemographic characteristics, and several chronic stressors. Our results reveal three important patterns. First, psychological aggression is associated with higher levels of psychological distress two years later. Second, minor physical assault and sexual coercion predict heavier drinking two years later. Finally, relationship violence in adulthood is not associated with changes in self-rated health. In the end, our results suggest that violence experiences beyond the formative and developmental years of childhood and adolescence may have far-reaching effects on adult heath status."
0,"A growing body of literature examines whether the poor, working class, and people of color are disproportionately likely to live in environmentally hazardous neighborhoods, with mixed results.  Some researchers suggest that methodological weaknesses are to blame for inconsistent findings.  In order to address these concerns, we use individual-level data from the 1995 Community, Crime, and Health Survey (Ross and Britt, co-PIs) linked with 1990 U.S. Census data and 1995 Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) data.  Using these data we are able to test whether individual characteristics are related to hazard exposure, as population characteristics have been in many previous studies.  We also examine whether patterns of environmental inequality that exist in urban areas hold up in suburban and rural areas, using multiple measures of environmental hazards.  Being Hispanic and family income are more consistent predictors of waste exposure than race, although race also matters.  While the impacts of individuals race and family income are explained by neighborhoods characteristics, the association between being Hispanic and waste exposure is not. We find less inequality in the distribution of waste in metropolitan Chicago than in the rest of Illinois.  Income does not explain racial or ethnic inequality."
0,"This paper focuses on young men's participation in the illegal and organized car racing scenes in Northern California. Tuning cars has re-emerged as a wildly popular activity for a teeming crop of young men across various ethnic and income groups in recent years. This paper explores the complex racial and class organization this contemporary youth car culture.  Drawing from in-depth and focus group interviews, electronic bulletin boards maintained by young car enthusiasts and observations of an auto shop class, I analyze the ways cars are encoded racially and ethnically as young men struggle to find their place in a complex and hierarchical order of masculinities. I analyze the ways in which young men as they struggle to assert themselves as men, in relation to other men use the car to construct and define their ethnic-racial self in and against racial-ethnic others. Zeroing in on the emergent rivalry between the import racing scene and reigning American Muscle, I examine the ways race-car talk provides a means for young men to work through and make sense of their place in the racial realities of the ethnically diverse and increasingly global community, Silicon Valley, California."
0,"In this paper I utilize two very different (perhaps competing) theories of gender and the experience of sexuality. Through an analysis of the sexual biographies of a group of heterosexual young men and women, I try to understand their move toward increased sexual agency by integrating psychoanalytic and interactionist theoretical perspectives. The analysis utilizes the partial findings from a larger study looking at how young people negotiate sexual encounters. In this project I found a range of different sexual styles, which varied by the degree of agency evidenced. There is a discernable difference between those who actively negotiate sexual interactions and those who passively succumb to them. Of the research subjects participating in in-depth interviews for this study, approximately one fourth demonstrate considerable agency in their participation in sexual encounters, a full half choose not to act agentically and approximately one fourth of the participants demonstrate a shift between styles over several encounters in their sexual biographies. In this paper I examine the latter group, those subjects who transition from one sexual style to another."
0,"In her analysis of the dialectical structure of reproductive consciousness, Mary OBrien argued that the physical labor involved in womens reproductive experiences affirms womens connections with their children and integration into the human species, whereas mens discontinuous experiences negate such connections and integration.  Patriarchy enables the reconciliation of this negation for men, by allowing them to claim ownership of the products of womens reproductive labor.  Drawing on interview data with 18 postpartum women, this paper re-examines OBriens central argument in conjunction with empirical data.  The findings support OBriens assertions that (1) work is viewed by some women as an essential component of childbearing, and (2) childbearing results in a sense of greater connectedness and integration into the human species for some women.  However, women also emphasized the importance of another element of childbearing  an indescribable, in-comprehensible, experiential component  that is missing from OBriens analysis and much feminist literature on reproduction.  It is argued that placing this experiential element of childbearing at the center of feminist work can further our understanding of reproductive experiences and enhance current debates over the appropriate role of men in childbearing."
0,"There is dissension in the literature on the measurement of attribution of responsibility.  Sociologists, psychologists, and criminologists use attribution of responsibility but its dimensionality has not been established.  The present study was designed to test if attribution of responsibility is a multidimensional or unidimensional concept.  Data were collected from 201 undergraduate students enrolled in Introduction to Sociology courses at a large Midwestern University to examine whether attribution of responsibility is a unidimensional or multidimensional concept.    Results indicate that there are four separate factors associated with attribution of responsibility, causality, knowledge, intentionality, and moral wrongfulness, which supports the contention that attribution of responsibility is a multidimensional concept.  Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed."

Muslim women's organizations are playing an important role in how the Indonesian nation-state is being re-imagined for the 21(st) century. Muslim women's groups are incubators for women's diverse political activism. The increasing role of Islam in the public sphere provides religious women with an important platform, facilitating their involvement in national debates over issues such as Shariah law, abortion and pornography. Such public sphere debates enfold significant struggles over the relationship between religion and the state. Through their involvement in these debates, Muslim women activists should be seen as participants in the renegotiation of the Indonesian nation-state."
0,"Marriage has been described as “greedy” when it comes to intergenerational ties, but little is known about the impact of marriage on civic ties. Using two waves of panel data from the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 8,053), this study examines whether marital status continuity and transitions affect involvement in secular and religious forms of civic engagement for both men and women. The findings suggest that marriage is associated with increases in both men’s and women’s religious civic engagement. This study also suggests that marriage helps to structure adult patterns of civic engagement, and it provides some evidence that marriage is greedier for women than men when it comes to secular civic engagement."
0,"Numerous researchers discuss the solidarity-producing effects of crime, natural disasters and mass tragedies; however, there is much we do not understand about the processes involved in the phenomena. We specify the social relationships that generate and sustain solidarity by building on Hunter's descriptions of the private, parochial and public spheres of community. We argue that event-specific parochial and event-specific public activities generate solidarity after heinous crimes. However, general parochial activities, such as attending local organizational meetings and frequenting local businesses, sustain solidarity. Using longitudinal data collected after the mass murder of 27 students and 5 faculty members on Virginia Tech's campus in 2007, a repeated measures analysis predicting levels of solidarity 5, 9 and 13 months after the tragedy supports our hypotheses."
0,"In a groundbreaking study, Christakis and Fowler (2010) showed that the friends of a random sample of Harvard students contracted the flu an average of two weeks before the random sample itself.  These findings provide direct evidence that people’s friends tend to get the flu before they do, and they also   show that the friends of a random sample can be effective advanced sensors for a population.  However, we discuss several reasons why individuals chosen only because they are central in networks may be highly unrepresentative and misleading as advanced sensors.  In particular, we suggest that the disease experience of many friends of a large random sample are likely to be indicative of spread within different clusters at different times, while the experiences of the most central individuals may not be."
0,"The events of Hurricane Katrina were associated with serious immediate and long-term health problems for people who remained in the area and those who were displaced from the area.  In the months following Katrina it was evident that mental health problems after a disaster experience can be especially long-lasting.  In this paper we discuss three sociological perspectives on health consequences of events surrounding Hurricane Katrina.  First, in comparative perspective, research indicates commonalities in mental health outcomes for people impacted by disasters, but individual and community mental health responses have also been found to vary significantly as a function of influences from social structure and cultural factors.  Second, from a health policy perspective, events surrounding Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath highlighted the need for health care system changes that are viewed as essential for public health preparedness.  Finally, the Katrina catastrophe must be viewed from a sociological model of health and illness, in which social conditionsespecially the intersection of race, class, and povertyserve as fundamental determinants of health."
0,"The article analyzes differences between realist and pragmatist conceptions of evolutionary approaches to the social sciences. In particular, the realist view where Darwinism is understood as an ontological basis of social sciences is contrasted with a pragmatist evolutionary approach. To promote empirical analysis of social life, the realists ontology of sui generis society and causally powerful mental entities need to be replaced by a Deweyan operational methodology concentrating on the actors point of view. While realists believe that each of the social sciences have its own realm of reality to study, for pragmatists the social sciences differ from each other simply on the basis of their varying ways of setting and framing research questions. A pragmatist methodology, operational and relational as it is, emphasizes the role of strictly defined case studies, which have nothing to do with estimating how accurately scientific concepts represent the entities of reality or reflect their ultimate essences."
0,"Publicly traded firms in the U.S. typically determine C.E.O. compensation by benchmarking the pay of their C.E.O.s against the pay of C.E.O.s in “peer” firms.  The naming of particular peer companies by individual firms constitutes a supra-firm relational structure (network) in which an individual firm’s executive pay setting is embedded.  As such, the compensation structure and level for any one executive at any one firm is influenced not only by firm-level characteristics, but also by the selection and actions of the firm’s immediate peers, and by the structure of the executive compensation network overall.   Using data that we collected from FY 2007 proxy filings about 16,000 C.E.O. compensation peer choices made by 1,466 public companies, we find that while the typical peer is from a firm similar in size and industry, deviations from this norm are common, especially for larger firms with better compensated CEOs. When companies go outside this ""natural"" peer population, their choice is structured: they tend to choose peers larger than themselves.  As a consequence, we find that the actual peers chosen by firms produce median pay benchmark values 15% to 20% greater than those produced by the full choice set of similar firms."
0,"This paper reveals insights into how different players in the field of U.S. healthcare utilize the Internet to present certain conceptions about health to the public.  I examine three websites sponsored by three different types of health actors.  I find that the websites all present messages that on the one hand, advance the neo-liberal agenda by advocating individuals to take active control over their health, and on the other, proclaim the continued relevance and importance of mainstream western medicine as a primary distributor of care.  Additionally, depending on the type of health actor operating the website the websites health messages reflected different agendas.  This provides evidence that while operating within a cultural script there is room for actors to advance messages that promote their individual goals."

These levels reflect access to and diffusion of technologies, proficiency in Internet usage, and propensity to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by information and communication technologies for assistance in daily life. We assess the utility of this approach for studying digital inequality across rural, suburban, and urban counties. Based on data from a 2005 nationally representative random sample telephone survey of 2,185 adults, the results provide mixed support for using this approach to studying digital inequality. In particular, we find that rural residents use Internet technologies less for assistance in helping with economics and other daily activities when compared with individuals from suburban and urban areas; however, our results suggest that this relationship is the product of the slow diffusion of advanced technologies to rural areas. The implications of these findings for understanding this under-theorized form of inequality are discussed, and we make contributions to this literature through empirically addressing issues of digital capital."
0,"Recruitment plays a significant role in understanding sex-based employment inequality; however, agricultural workers have been historically excluded from these analyses.  This study explores recruitment as a mechanism influencing agricultural work, using the 1989-2009 National Agricultural Workers Survey.  The results show that both male and female Latina/o farmworkers largely use personal contact referrals to obtain agricultural jobs, and characteristics indicative of increased familiarity with the U.S. labor market tend to significantly reduce the odds of using personal contact referrals.  Also, in terms of employment outcomes, recruitment partially mediates the relationship between sex and hourly wages.  However, when tested in separate models, for women, recruitment has no effect on hourly wages when individual and employment-related characteristics are included in the model, and for men, only recruitment by a farm labor contractor has a negative effect on hourly wages when individual and employment-related characteristics are introduced into the model."
0,"Fischer (2009) argues that our estimates of confidant network size in the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS), and therefore the trend in confidant network size from 1985 to 2004, are implausible because they are (1) inconsistent with other data and (2) contain internal anomalies that call the data into question. In this note, we assess the evidence for a decrease in confidant network size from 1985 to 2004 in the GSS data. We conclude that any plausible modeling of the data shows a decided trend downward in confidant network size from 1985 to 2004. The features that Fischer calls anomalies are exactly the characteristics described by our models (Table 5) in the original article."
0,"The Chinese cultural feature, known as guanxi, has been pegged as the reason strong ties, and not weak ties, are instrumental for the job matching process in Chinese society.  Interviews with human resource managers in Taipei show that invoking guanxi, to match a candidate with a position, is overwhelmingly a unidirectional process. Managers used guanxi to target specific candidates, but when the managers themselves were targeted by less-than-qualified job seekers, they usually refused to make the hire. Job seekers preferred to search through strong, guanxi ties because such ties allowed them to obtain privileged information about a prospective company; then, once hired, allowed them to have power and influence on the job.  For low-level positions, using guanxi through the firms other employees helped managers to quickly fill a large number of positions and trust that operations would run smoothly.  For high-level positions, managers used their own guanxi to secure highly demanded, qualified candidates, who could be trusted.  In both cases, managers additionally noted that using guanxi was less expensive compared with other formal search methods.  For middle-level positions, however, this paper asserts that hiring through guanxi is de-emphasized, as managers expressed that strongly tied, middle-level employees can informally unite in practices, which are counterproductive to management objectives."
0,"The Hispanic population of the United States has grown dramatically over the past few decades, becoming the largest U.S. minority group as of 2000. The large influx of a phenotypically, linguistically, and culturally distinct population has resulted in an increase of anti-Hispanic and anti-immigrant sentiment. Economic threat theories posit that these negative attitudes stem from perceived (or real) economic competition, while prejudice-based theories claim that they stem from ingrained stereotypes and prejudices. Utilizing data from the 1996, 2000, and 2004 waves of the National Election Study, this analysis attempts to determine whether economic threat or prejudices drive opinions on border control, immigration policy, and beliefs about whether immigrants take jobs. Preliminary results indicate that neither theory adequately accounts for the opinion patterns found in the data."
0,"This study examined the relationship between sexual experience and risky levels of alcohol consumption among a sample of 550 incoming first-year college females. As predicted, compared to their sexually inexperienced peers, sexually experienced women were more likely to endorse drinking motives and expectancies, consumed more alcohol, and encountered greater alcohol-related nonsexual consequences over and above alcohol consumption. Moreover, coping motives appeared to moderate the relationship between sexual status and alcohol-related consequences, such that coping induced drinking was found to be most hazardous for sexually experienced women. Implications for early intervention and preventative efforts targeted toward at-risk college students are discussed."
0,"This paper provides new estimates of Hispanic-white residential segregation in new destinations and established Hispanic places. New Hispanic destinations are defined broadly to include metropolitan Cities, Suburban places, and rural communities with unusually rapid Hispanic growth rates. The analysis is framed with the spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives and is based on block data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses. The analysis confirms our basic hypothesis - that Hispanics are highly segregated in new Hispanic destinations. often at levels greatly exceeding those in established places. Hispanic suburbanization or exurbanization into new destinations is no marker of spatial assimilation. Consistent with the place stratification perspective, differences in Hispanic-white segregation between new destinations and established Hispanic areas cannot be explained by place-to-place differences in ecological location, Population composition, economic growth, employment, or Hispanic-white income inequality. Hispanic segregation in new destinations is especially sensitive to the size of the foreign-born Population and to preexisting ""minority threats"" in communities with large black populations. Segregation levels in new destinations also are less responsive to income disparities between Hispanics and whites; economic assimilation does not insure Hispanic spatial assimilation. Understanding how newcomers are spatially incorporated in new destinations will be a continuing challenge for scholars concerned about the spatial diffusion and apparent geographic balkanization of America's growing Hispanic Population.

0,"While work experience is generally seen as an indicator of human capital, it may also reflect the accumulation of social capital. This study examines how work experience facilitates informal access to employment that is, being matched with a new employer through an informal search or informal recruitment through the non-search process (without engaging in a job search). Results from fixed effects regression on panel data from the NLSY show that experience is related to informal entry into new jobs, though in a very specific way. The odds of being informally recruited into a new job improve as work experience in related occupations rises, but this relationship holds only among men. These findings highlight the social benefits of occupation-specific work experience that accrue to men but not to women, suggesting an alternative explanation for the gender disparity in wage returns to experience.

0,"Over the past four decades a growing body of research has documented the negative social psychological and health-related consequences of racism and experiences with discrimination for the well-being and quality of life of African-Americans. As a result of research that gained impetus in the 1990s, it is now well-established that experiences with discrimination adversely affect the physical and mental health of members of racial minorities. For instance, experiences with discrimination have been linked to poor physical health outcomes and risk factors such as hypertension, cardiovascular dysfunction, breast cancer, obesity, poor subjective health status, and addiction. Similarly, perceptions of unfair treatment have been found to be related to a variety of poor mental health outcomes including depression, psychological distress, and anxiety. Largely absent from this literature, however, are studies that focus on the potentially deleterious impact of discriminatory experiences in the workplace. This is a curious omission in light of the fact that, arguably, it is in the workplace where discrimination is manifested most obviously and directly. Indeed, it has been suggested that job and workplace discrimination are the most common forms of experiences with discrimination among employed persons. In this study we address this possibility by deriving and testing a model of the impact of current and past experiences with job discrimination on the work-related affect and quality of worklife of employed African-Americans. We find that workplace discrimination is a strong predictor of worker affect."
0,"Focusing on processes of historical change, this paper contrasts the ontological premises, theories of motivations and causal models of two approaches which their proponents portray as standing far apart: the Theory of Practice and Rational Choice. I argue that this theoretical antinomy loses much of its edge when we try to specify in theoretical terms how, and in which conditions, historical actors enact and endorse shifts in patterns of relations as well as shifts in the symbolic and cognitive categories that make these relations significant. I substantiate this argument in light of the distinction between two temporalities of historical change: first the long waves of gradual change and, second, the short waves of moments of breaks and ruptures."

How does use the organization use gender in constructing collective identity?  How do these multiple constructions vary by intended audience or with changes in the political environment?

0,"From 1879-1882 Ireland underwent a revolutionary process, the Irish Land War. Begun as an agarian agitation in the face of economic crisis, the land movement grew into the pivotal nineteenth-century nationalist campaign against British domination. Through what I term ""the network of ritualization"" virtually all the Irish had become movement participants  by 1880 and Ireland was in the throes of intense discursive struggle and cultural crisis. While Irish narratives of conquest, confiscation, famine, repression and exile formed a significant basis for the formulation of counter hegemony, the Irish transformed a key symbolic code of British political culture and hegemony - the meaning of constitutional, integrated it into the movement discourse and ideology, and effectively used it to delegitimate British rule. This paper examines this process of symbolic appropriation during cultural crisis through the discursive practices of political actors."
0,"This study revisits and extends a classic question in sociology and tests three competing hypotheses about the effects of intragenerational social class mobility on distress and psychological well-being at midlife. Prior research on this topic investigated the effects of intergenerational mobility, but did not look at how mobility during adulthood (intragenerational mobility) affects psychological distress and well-being. Previous literature is also limited by methodological problems that make it difficult to estimate the separate effects of prior social class, current social class, and social mobility. This study overcomes this methodological problem using a novel approach that breaks the linear dependence between prior class, current class, and intragenerational mobility. After accounting for prior and current class, I find that social mobility is not associated with psychological distress and self-acceptance. Instead, mobile individuals come to resemble their nonmobile counterparts in their current class on the outcomes of study. "
0,"We construct a dynamic racial residential history typology and examine its association with self-rated health and mortality among black and white adults. Data are from a national survey of U.S. adults, combined with census tract data from 1970-1990. Results show that racial disparities in health and mortality are explained by both neighborhood contextual and individual socioeconomic factors. Results suggest that living in an established black neighborhood or in an established interracial neighborhood may actually be protective of health, once neighborhood poverty is controlled. Examining the dynamic nature of neighborhoods contributes to an understanding of health disparities."
0,"How do social policies shape life courses, and which consequences do different life course patterns hold for individuals? This article engages the example of retirement in Germany and Britain to analyze life course patterns and their consequences for income inequality. Sequence analysis is used to measure retirement trajectories. The liberal welfare state in Britain generates more unstable retirement trajectories (differentiated) that are more dissimilar across the population (de-standardized) than the conservative-corporatist welfare state in Germany. Contrary to common conjectures, this is not associated with higher income inequality among retirees in Britain. This study concludes that there is no simple straightforward link between life course patterns and income inequality."
0,"In this paper, I describe and analyze anti-torture work in the US, offering a pro-litigation, anti-populist yet progressive-minded argument to focus on challenges to American torture in the post-9/11 “war on terror.” The argument and the evidence that supports it cuts against the grain of socio-legal literature on litigation and progressive causes. Anti-torture litigation is not one of many or the best of several tactical options, nor does opting for litigation risk compromising social movement goals and agendas because there is no anti-torture social movement in the US. There is an anti-torture campaign, however, composed of lawyers and intellectuals—elites who have the requisite knowledge to comprehend and criticize the government’s interpretations of Constitutional, military, federal and international laws that led to the official authorization of torture. Courts have been the main sites of contention in this anti-torture campaign."
0,"Despite some promising steps in the right direction, organizational analysis has yet to exploit fully the theoretical and empirical possibilities inherent in the writings of Pierre Bourdieu.  To be sure, certain concepts associated with his thought, such as field and capital, two of the cornerstones of his sociology, are already widely known in the organizational literature.  However, the specific ways in which these terms are being used (or mis-used) provide ample evidence that the full significance of his relational mode of thought has yet to be sufficiently apprehended.  Moreover, the almost complete inattention to habitus, the third of Bourdieus major concepts, without which the concepts of field and capital (at least as he deployed them) make no sense, further attests to the misappropriation of his ideas and to the lack of appreciation of their potential usefulness.  It is our aim in this paper, by contrast, to set forth a more informed and comprehensive account of what a relationaland in particular, a Bourdieu-inspiredagenda for organizational research might look like.  Drawing in part on as-yet-untranslated work by Bourdieu in the areas of organizational and economic sociology, we systematically examine the implications of his theoretical framework for interorganizational relations as well as for organizations themselves analyzed as fields.  The primary advantage of such an approach, we argue, is the central place accorded therein to the social conditions under which inter- and intraorganizational power relations are produced, reproduced, and contested."
0,"Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1) social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed.

0,"This study examines the effect of the state on participation in human rights international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) from 1966 through 2006, using random effects negative binomial models. Civic participation in human rights INGOs is not responsive to human rights abuses of the state, but is affected by the institutional environment provided by the state. Two intertwined dimensions within the state, democracy and state capacity, are found to be important in explaining cross-national variation in this participation. Strong state capacity magnifies the effect of democracy. A strong democratic state generates the most favorable condition. A strong but authoritarian state, however, is the most unfavorable, because it has both the motive and the capacity to restrain its citizens' global civic engagement. In contrast, an authoritarian but weak state lacks adequate capacity to intervene, and thus tolerates more participation than its strong counterpart. Over time differential participation across different types of states has not been diminished. This study reveals the role of the state in mediating between local citizens and global civil society, and develops a state-centered explanation for unequal participation in human rights INGOs across countries.

0,"Using terms like free spaces and havens, conventional wisdom views social ties by subordinate groups to dominant group members as hindering protest participation. In contrast, we draw on ethnic resiliency and social capital perspectives and argue that there are mobilization benefits to having dominant group members as friends. We offer a unique statistical test by examining the effect of white social ties on Mexican American participation in cultural and political protest. Using survey data, bivariate and multivariate results demonstrate that social connections to whites promote Mexican American activism. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings can be reconciled with previous scholarship."
0,"This paper explores imprisoned women’s place in the liberal democracy of the United States within a discussion of the public sphere; that is, I investigate the notion of “publics” as articulated by contemporary elaborations of the Habermasian concept “the public” within the context of fieldwork in a female prison in California.  Intellectual contributions on “publics” and “counterpublics” by Michael Warner and Nancy Fraser, as well as Lauren Berlant’s notion of an “intimate public” of “women’s culture” are reviewed in terms of the sphere imprisoned women inhabit.  Berlant’s notion of “women’s culture” resonates with female inmates’ experiences but, to some degree, imprisoned women represent no identifiable “public” and are, according to activist and scholar Dylan Rodriguez, civically and juridically “dead.”  I argue that imprisoned women constitute a kind of secret “public” that incorporates the conceptions of counterpublics, “women’s culture,” and existences of oppression and resistance and which is sequestered from the general, complying public by a liberal state using the disciplinary logic of mass incarceration to protect and ensure the sanctity of the official “public.”"
0,"Work represents a primary sphere of social and economic life wherein stratification arrangements are created and reproduced. Stratification research has delineated how racial inequality within and across labor markets has resulted in wage, unemployment, and mobility inequalities. Less explicit has been the micro-mediational and interactional dynamics that are shaping these inequalities. Similarly, research on minority well-being has documented the relationship between race, discrimination, and mental health. However, research in this tradition has been less successful in identifying the processes that underlie this relationship. Scholars in both traditions have stressed the importance in examining the linkages between discrimination and inequality, however, limitations in available data precludes their ability to do so. In this paper I explore the relationship between discrimination across the labor market on the psychological well-being of individuals. Few studies to date have examined this relationship and those that have explored the link between discrimination and psychological functioning were limited to the use of perceived discrimination rather than actual instances of discrimination. Drawing from a unique data set of approximately 400 verified workplace discrimination charges filed with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, my research shows how it is likely that discrimination across industrial sectors shapes mental health outcomes. The qualitative immersion uncovered certain mechanisms, specifically the role of harassment, which may be central to understanding the link between discrimination and other outcomes such as psychological distress and depression. This is the first study of its kind exploring verified discrimination and consequences that seem to follow."
0,"Students at a mid-size state university in the Southeast were surveyed to examine religion, race, social class, and gender differences in dating and hooking up.  Our analyses revealed that dating and hooking up coexist on campus and most students defined hooking up as a sexual encounter.  Race impacted dating but other demographics, social class, and gender were not significant for either dating or hooking up. Conservative Protestants hooked up less than Catholics and other Protestants.  Seniors have dated and hooked up more than other students especially freshmen.  How students define hooking up impacts their probability of hooking up and their feelings after hooking up also have effect."
0,"In the United States, racial disparities in incarceration and their consequences are widely discussed and debated. Previous research suggests that perceptions of crime and the operations of the criminal justice system play an important role in shaping how Americans think about race. This study extends the conversation by exploring whether being incarcerated affects how individuals perceive their own race as well as how they are perceived by others, using unique longitudinal data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Results show that respondents who have been incarcerated are more likely to identify and be seen as black, and less likely to identify and be seen as white, regardless of how they were perceived or identified previously. This suggests that race is not a fixed characteristic of individuals but is flexible and continually negotiated in everyday interactions."
0,"This paper proposes a formal model aimed at the explanation and prediction of intentional human behavior, i.e. action. The purpose is to make a contribution towards providing social scientists with psychologically more defensible, yet precise assumptions on individual behavior and cognition, and thereby to facilitate a further development of social theory based on microfoundations. Most importantly, the model accounts for experience-based behavior and challenges Rational Choice. It embraces an interdisciplinary perspective and accommodates a number of more specialized prior approaches. Attractiveness, activation and associative value of a behavioral option are posited as the minimal factors determining the process of choice. The model is suited for applications in qualitative theorizing and research as well as for analytical deductions and predictive simulations."

A unique Swedish population-level database of university applications and individuals' ranking of different programs is used to analyze class differences in preferences for different program characteristics. Compared to individuals from service class backgrounds, individuals from manual labor class backgrounds choose programs of shorter duration with lower grade point requirements located closer to their parents' home. Children from the service class instead prefer programs with higher earnings risk and avoid nontraditional institutions. Taken together, the differences in degree choice lead to substantial differences in expected earnings levels and expected unemployment risks."
0,"Based on ethnographic research of welfare reform implementation practices in the United States and the Netherlands, I argue that citizenship should be understood not simply as the outcome of rights granted or withheld but as that aspect of ones sense of self constructed in the context of multi-layered state bureaucracies.  I look at welfare reform adopted in 1996 in both the United States and the Netherlands as an example of such a process of subject-formation.  In particular, I turn to implementation practices as a site in which the subjectivity of welfare-reliant women is defined.  In this paper, I analyze how welfare-reliant womens interactions with representatives of the welfare state and their understandings of welfare reform and welfare receipt influenced their understandings of self.  These understandings of self, I argue, show that the construction of citizenship is a relational project, predicated on particular, institutional practices of recognition."
0,"This article investigates the determinants of orgasm and sexual enjoyment in hookup and relationship sex among heterosexual college women and seeks to explain why relationship sex is better for women in terms of orgasm and sexual enjoyment. We use data from women respondents to a large online survey of undergraduates at 21 U.S. colleges and universities and from 85 in-depth interviews at two universities. We identify four general views of the sources of orgasm and sexual enjoyment-technically competent genital stimulation, partner-specific learning, commitment, and gender equality. We find that women have orgasms more often in relationships than in hookups. Regression analyses reveal that specific sexual practices, experience with a particular partner, and commitment all predict women's orgasm and sexual enjoyment. The presence of more sexual practices conducive to women's orgasm in relationship sex explains some of why orgasm is more common in relationships. Qualitative analysis suggests a double standard also contributes to why relationship sex is better for women: both men and women question women's (but not men's) entitlement to pleasure in hookups but believe strongly in women's (as well as men's) entitlement to pleasure in relationships. More attention is thus given to producing female orgasm in relationships."

A longstanding debate has existed in both the Political Science and Sociology literature as to how influential social movement lobbying activities and public opinion are on legislative outcomes.  While some theories of democracy state that public sentiment and interest group activity should be significant drivers of legislative behavior few empirical studies have attempted to examine this relationship closely.  The present study uses indicators of social movement activity, public opinion, partisanship and other important factors to determine the impact they may have on legislative voting."
0,"Abrams methodological insights have fueled much of the de-centred scholarship on state-formation. Still, fiction, veil, and fetish notwithstanding, sociologists continue to know the state when they see it thus giving the state empirically bounded reality. What Philip Abrams essay suggesting the analysis of politically organised subjection meant to me was that I ought to be prepared to be doing an ethnography of the developmental state when I least expected that I was looking at the state or development (1988). My ethnographic analysis of rural political theatre studies the relationship between everyday performativity (Butler 1990) and staged performativity (Dolan 2005) to ask whether theatre makes history, state, or structure by rendering such structures a matter of process in time (Abrams 1982: xv)."
0,"In their concerted efforts to unpack the microprocesses that transform repeated exchanges into an exchange relation, exchange theorists have paid little attention to how actors perceive changes and dynamics in exchanges over time. We help fill this gap by studying how temporal patterns of exchange affect the development of cohesion. Some exchange relations develop gradually as actors hedge their bets, making incremental commitments to ""test the water"" and manage the risks of exchange (incremental exchange). Other relations settle quickly into full commitment as actors take ""leaps of faith"" in each other (constant exchange). Do these patterns result in different levels of bonding? We examined this question across a series of two laboratory studies and a vignette survey that manipulated two dimensions of repeated exchange: resource level (how much actors exchange in each interaction) and frequency (how often actors exchange). In each study, participants played or imagined a series of social exchange tasks with a fixed partner. Results show that exchanging incrementally in resource level promotes cohesion, but exchanging incrementally in frequency undermines it. These findings affirm the importance of exchange frequency for cohesion, but demonstrate an opposite effect of resource level: compared to exchanging constant and full levels, exchanging incremental levels of resources creates more cohesion, even while resulting in lower instrumental benefits."
0,"Reports from academic and media sources assert that many young people substitute non-vaginal sexual activities for vaginal intercourse in order to maintain what could be called ""technical virginity."" Explanations for technical virginity, however, are based on weak empirical evidence and considerable speculation. Using a sample of 15-19-year-olds from Cycle 6 of the National Survey of Family Growth, we examine technical virginity and its motivations. The results suggest that religious adolescents are less likely than less-religious ones to opt for non-vaginal sex over total abstinence. Abstinence pledgers who are virgins are neither more nor less likely than nonpledgers who are virgins to substitute non-vaginal sex for intercourse. Moreover, religion and morality are actually the weakest motivators of sexual substitution among adolescents who have not had vaginal sex. Preserving technical virginity is instead more common among virgins who are driven by a desire to avoid potential life-altering consequences, like pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.

0,"Utilizing interviews with 37 law students and 42 business students, I examine the expectations and strategies of elite professional students to dilemmas posed by the balance of work and family. Most of these men and women want children, and support a strong family-oriented gender ideology in which students claim that family is more important than career. Moreover, many also subscribe to what Hays refers to as intensive mothering  a belief that parents should spend an enormous amount of time, physical and emotional energy, and money raising their children. However, the reality of the lives of these students questions the possibility of such a commitment to family and children. The respondents plan for careers with greedy institutions with long hours, commutes, and travel. Although women spend more time thinking and talking about these decisions than male students do, neither men nor women engage in strategies directed at accomplishing them (for example, by discussing these with prospective spouses, negotiating with current partners, querying companies about family-friendly policies, etc.). I conclude by explaining how preexisting gender and social class ideologies are altered by elite professional schooling, which reinforce work-oriented schemas but do nothing to reinforce a family schema."
0,"An important consideration in understanding family formation is the parent’s expectation about the companionship and assistance he/she will receive in later life from children. In this study, we explore the patterns of investment made by parents in their children and the support and contact they receive in return. We use data from a survey of older adults in Ismailia, Egypt, a setting in which fertility is rapidly changing but not enough is known about the patterns of support between parents and adult children. We consider parents’ investments in: childbearing; children’s education and marriage; ongoing transfers to adult children in terms of housing, childcare, gifts, and money; and the possibility of bequests. The returns from children are economic assistance, instrumental support with chores, errands, and activities of daily living, and visits. We find that, controlling for the parent’s personal characteristics and resources, in terms of assistance in old age, the investment that gives parents the most return is having more children.  Subsequent investments in these children are not associated with assistance received by parents. We also find that assistance to parents is gendered, with different types of returns from sons and daughters: sons provide economic transfers, while daughters provide instrumental assistance."
0,"Despite having closed the gap with Asians and whites with regards to accessing algebra I and geometry, Latinos graduate from high school without taking advanced math courses such as algebra II, trigonometry, pre-calculus and calculus in similar proportions.  Such underrepresentation in advanced math curriculum has serious implications for Latinos' postsecondary opportunities as well as careers in math and science-based fields.  This paper explores access to advanced math courses among 1992 Latino high school graduates.  More specifically, this study builds upon theoretical debates within the sociology of education literature by considering several independent variables that have not been included in traditional quantitative models of tracking and coursework completion.  Using the National Longitudinal Education Survey of 1988, I consider four factors that may explain Latino underrepresentation in advanced math courses:  1) a late start in taking gate keeping math courses such as algebra I and geometry, 2) grades earned in geometry, 3) lack of knowledge regarding the importance of advanced math for college bound students and 4) relationships with teachers.   The results show that Latinos get a late start at taking gate keeping math courses such as algebra I and geometry.  As ninth graders, they were more likely to take pre-algebra, basic, or vocational math courses compared to white students.  In addition, both the grade-level students were at when they took geometry and the grades they earned in geometry explain a significant amount of the variance in advanced math coursetaking between Latinos and whites.  The results of this study suggest Latinos face significant disadvantages during the transition from middle to high school.  In turn, such disadvantage impacts prospects for taking advanced math courses before graduating from high school.  These findings call into question the equality of opportunities for learning among students of different racial-ethnic groups with similar social and academic backgrounds."

0,"School sector and educational context seem to make a difference in civic socialization. There is limited knowledge, however, of the mechanisms through which socialization may occur in public and private schools, and the extent to which they have any lasting effect. Does the private school effect on civic socialization persist into young adulthood, and if it does, what explains the effect? Analyzing data from NELS:88 using HLM, the results of this study show that, net of background controls, there is a private school effect on civic participation in young adulthood, but it is mediated through contextual factors in the family and school-such as parent-school involvement, intergenerational closure, student-teacher relationships and prior participation that seem to account for the effect on adult civic behavior."
0,"We propose that a psychological mechanism, referred to as the social exchange heuristic (SEH), can explain the consistent finding of cooperation in a one-shot Prisoners Dilemma game and that the SEH is used by individuals in social exchange to manage errors. Further, the SEH produces certain cognitive biases that affect how individuals manage these errors. Specifically, the cognitive biases produced by the SEH reduce the probability of committing Type I errors in social exchange (believing that undetected/unpunished free-riding is possible when it is not), at the cost of increasing the probability of committing Type II errors (believing that free-riding is not possible when it is). We predict that the SEH would remain dormant in individuals who fail to realize that they are in a situation that involve social exchange. In the first experiment (n = 78), PD players who had a chance to think both about the nature of the game they were playing and about their partners choice were less cooperative compared to players of the standard one-shot PDG. In the second experiment (n = 105), PD players were again less cooperative when they made their decision before they were matched with a particular partner rather than after they had been matched with a partner. Results strongly suggest the operation of a SEH. From the current findings, we suggest combining the SEH account of cooperation with a social value orientation."
0,"While numerous studies discuss the political implications of class divisions among African-Americans, few analyze gender differences in political participation. This study assesses the extent to which church activity similarly facilitates men's and women's political participation. Employing data from a national cross-sectional survey of 1,205 adult African-American respondents from the 1993 National Black Politics Study, the authors conclude that black church involvement more highly facilitates the political participation of black men than black women. Increasing levels of individual black church involvement and political activity on the part of black churches increases the gender gap in political participation and creates a gender participation gap for some political activities. These findings suggest that while institutional engagement increases political participation, the gendered nature of the institutional context also influences political engagement outcomes."
0,"Despite radically different government institutions and political cultures, Massachusetts and Prussia both produced pioneering child labor laws at roughly the same time. In 1836, Massachusetts became the first American state to regulate child labor when it required children working in “manufacturing establishments” to attend school for at least three months per year. Six years later, it restricted the working hours of children under age twelve to ten per day. In 1839, Prussia became the first continental European state to intervene in children’s factory employment conditions by enacting educational requirements, setting the minimum employment age at nine, and prohibiting children under 16 from working more than ten hours per day. This paper explains the ideational motivations underlying these reforms and the institutional conditions and political opportunities which made them possible. Four commonalities emerge to help explain the similar timing and content of child labor regulations in Prussia and Massachusetts: (1) the similar timing of early industrialization; (2) a shared commitment to public education; (3) a common political opportunity created by elite fear of social disorder and revolution; and (4) the emergence of policy entrepreneurs who connected social unrest with child labor, took advantage of political opportunities, and successfully navigated institutional decision-making structures."
0,"This presentation, which stems from a larger project on the experiences of gay and lesbian teachers, focuses on this process of constructing gay and lesbian identities in the educational context.  I argue here that sexual identities as a whole are shaped through the teaching profession.  Specifically, perceived pressures to keep sexuality—queer sexualities in particular—out of schools results in a “splitting” of self for gay and lesbian teachers, which aids in the erasure of queer visibility in the educational context. Insofar as gay/lesbian sexualities are becoming permissible in some places, there is yet another tier of expectations that ""out"" teachers must manage.  In this presentation, I outline the pervading pressures gay and lesbian teachers experienced that encourage them to maintain a split between their “public” lives as teachers and their “private” lives as gays and lesbians.  I then explain how the constructions of the “acceptable gay” and “unacceptable gay” that emerged from the interviews further constrain the kinds of queer representations that are allowed to emerge in the school context and how these impact queer pedagogical opportunities.  These boundaries that develop in the construction of classroom gay identities prevent the possibility of developing “queer friendly schools” and ultimate support the systems of privilege that many hoped would be challenged by gay and lesbian visibility."
0,"The increasing manipulations of the human genome to predict human risk of disease may have profound implications on how we understand health and illness, as well as our biological and social relatedness to others. However, unlike the growing number of genetic tests available to determine the risk of disease in individuals and families, diseases with limited genetic predictability must rely on other forms of information to interpret disease risk. For autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the interpretation of risk becomes further complicated due to the nuanced and varied symptoms of ASD that rely on behavioral and psychological characteristics, rather then specific biological markers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the biological and social understanding of autism based on experiences of adults on the autism spectrum and to address their understanding and opinions of research on the genetics of autism. Based on 18 in-depth interviews with adults diagnosed or identified with ASD, this paper will explore different forms of biosociality that exist based on experiences of everyday lives and generations of different traits that run in the family, rather than genetic information alone. It will also offer advice to researchers studying autism from the perspective of those living and experiencing autism in their daily lives."
0,"This dissertation investigates the role of early time use socialization on social class reproduction and status attainment.  The first part focuses on the relationship between parents’ class position and children’s early (ages 6-12) time use patterns.  The second part looks at the relationship between early time use socialization and later academic outcomes.  Using a nationally representative dataset from the U.S. (the Panel Study of Income Dynamics), I aim to integrate literatures on the sociology of time use, sociology of education, and social stratification as they apply to children and the family."
0,"In this paper I will present a conflict model of professionalism on the basis of the game model ""Battle of the Sexes"". On the basis of the conflict model ""Battle of the Sexes"" we can conceptualize the conflict of professionalism as a conflict of individual autonomy, reflexivity, and dynamics versus social regulation, formalization, and social closure. The crucial aspect of this model is to present conflict as an essentially dilemmatic situation without a once and for all solution. Thus, it takes account of the inherently ambivalent dynamics of conflict either leading to an upgrading circulus virtuosus or a downgrading circulus vitiosus. In the case of professionalism an upgrading circle would enhance a dynamic stability between individual reflexivity and collective regulation, while a downgrading circle would combine a façade culture of hypocrisy with the anomie of social struggles. We can relate this model to the question of culture. While the market-oriented culture of Anglo-American professionalism rather stresses the side of individual autonomy and reflexivity, the state-centered culture of Continental Europe rather emphasizes the side of collective regulation and security. The final and yet open question will be, if both models of professionalism, i.e. actor-centered professionalism and formal professionalization, can survive the multiple new pressures summarized under the label of globalization."
0,"Many doctors consider Chronic Fatigue Syndrome to be caused by mental issues, a clinical diagnosis that patients have struggled against.  Patients have argued that the causal factor of CFS is physical malfunction, possibly viral infection.  But after the recent publication of scientific articles which show new biological findings regarding Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), the situation has been changing for CFS patients.  The recent biological findings provide patients some supportive evidence.  CFS patients are fighting against existing medical knowledge, existing medical services, and the existing social system by using this new scientific knowledge.  Can this phenomenon be considered medicalization, specifically biomedicalization, or, rather, a Health Social Movement?  This study addresses this question by exploring the activities of CFS patient support groups, activists, and professionals based on field work and research both in the US and Japan.  Through examining the differences and similarities of the activities of CFS support groups, I will analyze the socio-cultural characteristics of both countries and their relevant contexts."
0,"This study explores the role of shame, assignment of reasonability, knowledge of HIV and degree of religiosity, in stigmatizing people living with HIV/AIDS.  The sample consisted of 501 undergraduate students (251 males and 250 females) who attended a large public university in Yemen.  The results show that AIDS-related shame is a powerful predictor of stigma attached to people with HIV/AIDS followed by attribution of responsibility. Knowledge of HIV and religiosity, however, were not important in predicting stigma attached to HIV-positive people."
0,"This article is based on a study on a random sample of 108 internally displaced persons (IDP) camps – one in eight in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area – conducted during July-August, 2010. This article discusses how international development agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) failed to secure the human rights to water and health for all of Haiti’s 1.5 million IDPs. Among other indicators, 30 percent of IDP camps had no toilets, and 40 percent had no access to water. This lack of sanitation services created a prime breeding ground for cholera, killing over 2,700 people two months following its initial outbreak."
0,"How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time. In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white protest events to be policed. While there is support for a ''Protesting While Black'' phenomenon, it is not invariant across the entire period of inquiry."
0,"Over the past decade we have been witnessing an international trend towards the increased use of risk assessment information in criminal proceedings.  This trend is particularly notable in the US, Canada and the UK where risk technologies are invoked both overtly and indirectly within the courtroom.  While ample theoretical knowledge about risk exists, there are noticeably fewer empirical studies of how risk frameworks (re)shape and (re)organize local institutional decision-making practices and the socio-political effects of these processes.  Drawing on interviews, case law review and analyses of risk assessment documents, this article considers the implications of using risk assessments in the preparation of pre-investigation reports (PSIs)."
0,"The effects of segregation on college GPA are estimated with longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF).  Whereas theories suggesting that males from segregated communities form street orientations relative to female home orientations imply male susceptibility to exposure to violence and social disorder, this analysis suggests that among elite college students females experience the negative effects of segregation relative to their male counterparts in ways unexplained by family SES, prior school quality, and environmental factors.  While the gender difference in segregation effects is driven entirely by black females, those females nonetheless continue to outperform males in college, further complicating the puzzle of minority achievement."
0,"This paper offers a descriptive study of information networks among homeless men in a private New York City shelter. Based on ethnographic fieldwork at All Angels&#8217; Church on West 80th Street in Manhattan, I examine how homeless men exchange mental-health information. I employ the theoretical perspective or approach of social network analysis (SNA) to investigate these information networks. The approach originated with British anthropologist J.A. Barnes who found, in the early 1950s, that structural functionalism could not explain certain aspects of social interaction in urban settings. J. Clyde Mitchell introduced concepts of what occurs in networks: information, transactions, and expectations. The research will show four things. First, information exchange, particularly mental-health information exchange, occurs among homeless men in New York City through places and people. Some of these people include specific social actors known as &#8220;brokers&#8221; or &#8220;street lawyers.&#8221; Second, this exchange takes place in an overt, named &#8220;network.&#8221; Third, this information network has a horizontal organization. Finally, these aspects of the network produce mixed results in the quality of mental health care received by homeless men."
0,"Theorists in the sociology of culture have addressed the process through which cultural objects come to have meaning; and how they succeed or fail in a marketplace of potentially resonant ideas. The recent controversy around the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana's mascot provides a good site to examine such theoretical questions. Since 1989, their Indian-themed mascot, Chief Illiniwek, has become the epicenter of local, state, and national attention about the meaning and appropriate uses of race-related symbols. Analyzing Chief Illiniwek from Griswold's cultural diamond perspective, I examine how two groups of cultural receivers constructed and forwarded meanings of the symbol-as either an honored tradition or legacy of cultural oppression-to rally support for their position to keep or retire the Chief."
0,"In this paper, we consider the following question for the analysis of data obtained in longitudinal panel designs: How should repeated-measures data be modeled and interpreted when the outcome or dependent variable is dichotomous and the objective is to determine whether the within-person rate of change over time varies across levels of one or more between-person factors? Standard approaches address this issue by means of generalized estimating equations or generalized linear mixed models with logistic links. Using an empirical example and simulated data, we show (1) that cross-level product terms from these models can produce misleading results with respect to whether the within-person rate of change varies across levels of a dichotomous between-person factor; and (2) that subgroup differences in the rate of change should be assessed on an additive scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the probability of disease) rather than on a multiplicative scale (using group differences in the effects of predictors on the odds of disease). Because usual approaches do not provide a significance test for whether the rate of additive change varies across levels of a between-person factor. sample differences in the rate of additive change may be due to sampling error. We illustrate how standard software can be used to estimate and test whether additive changes vary across levels of a between-person factor. "
0,"Research on human trafficking conducted to date reveals certain limitations. First, little research, if any, exists that focuses specifically on analyzing occurrences of human trafficking incidents resulting in arrests and/or prosecutions. This suggests that the primary concern of previous research is not focused on understanding the trafficking event through analysis of the event in and of itself. Rather, previous research focuses primarily on discussions of various components of human trafficking without analyzing actual trafficking events. The importance of research focusing of incidents of human trafficking arrests and prosecutions is found in the ability for this type of research to better understand and predict precisely what occurs within the event, including the types of individuals involved. Additionally, this type of research allows for discussions of the modalities utilized by law enforcement in detecting human trafficking. Second, very few human trafficking studies break away from the traditional male/female dichotomy in order to understand the actors involved in the act. In particular, it is tremendously important to understand the actors not by their gender, but by their actions, pathways and networks that determine their inclusion in underground trafficking and smuggling economies. Essentially, both are elements of globalization and transnational migration, and should be assessed as such. My intention with this paper is not to irreverently stir the pot, but to illustrate the issues pertinent to human trafficking scholarship. The grey area is far too large for the continuance of calls to curb trafficking without understanding the logistics and rationale behind the action."
0,"The census tract-based residential segregation literature rests on problematic assumptions about geographic scale and proximity. We pursue a new tract-free approach that combines explicitly spatial concepts and methods to examine racial segregation across egocentric local environments of varying size. Using 2000 Census data for the 100 largest US. metropolitan areas, we compute a spatially modified version of the information theory index H to describe patterns of Black-White, Hispanic-White, Asian-White, and multigroup segregation at different scales. We identify the metropolitan structural characteristics that best distinguish micro-segregation from macro-segregation for each group combination, and we decompose their effects into portions due to racial variation occurring over short and long distances. A comparison of our results with those from tract-based analyses confirms the value of the new approach."
0,"Face transplantation, the surgical replantation of a donor’s face onto a recipient’s skull for the treatment of severe “disfigurement,” has simultaneously been celebrated as the most promising mode of reconstructive surgery and demonized as an innovation which calls primary tenets of modern medicine into question.  In this paper, I analyze a 2004 issue of The American Journal of Bioethics in which experts—including medical researchers, surgeons, bioethicists, and psychologists—considered the issue of face transplantation.  Through content analysis of the AJOB exchange, I highlight the terms of contestation and demonstrate that each position is structured by varying claims about risk, the conception of what constitutes a “vital” intervention, and the relationship between aesthetics and life itself.  Ultimately, I situate then the debate about the risks and benefits of face transplantation into a larger context of bioethics and ask about the consequences of conceptualizing interventions on appearance as life saving work."
0,"How well is the ?Washington Consensus? surviving local politics in the long run?  When it comes to structural reform, how predictable are the proponents and opponents of privatization?  Using Venezuela as a case study, this paper examines the relationship between the trajectory of neoliberalism and local processes of implementation.  More specifically, it explores one aspect affecting neoliberalism?s trajectory, public opinion, as a causal variable to explain outcomes of one type of neoliberal structural reform, privatization.  This paper analyzes this relationship in the specific context of efforts to privatize state-owned aluminum and steel assets in Ciudad Guayana, Venezuela.  Despite strong unions in these industries and a locally economy entirely dependent on these state-owned industries, there was little opposition to privatization, only concern about its local effects.  After reviewing the privatization process at a national level and recounting the tension between local aspirations for privatization and the global structures constraining them, I present results from long-term content analysis, in-depth interviews as well as original survey data to show that despite a willingness among the population to face the risks of privatization, local groups also worked to have their interests represented in sale contracts.  Even though local preferences in the non-core region were successfully articulated as part of sales contracts, long-term global price declines along with a global oversupply of steel and aluminum as well as steel and aluminum companies ultimately constrained the extent to which these provisions protecting workers and the local economy were fulfilled."
0,"Americans are increasingly forming intimate relations outside the purview of traditional social controls, such as the institution of marriage and networks of kin.  These changes raise questions about the organization of intimacy in contemporary relationships.  This research examines the manner in which members of an intimate partnership adopt a variety of dyadic and extradyadic practices, or cohesive practices, that are typically associated with the signaling of commitment.  Drawing on the 1995-1997 Chicago Health and Social Life Survey, a latent class model of patterns of cohesive practices shows three distinct types: tight-knit, loosely coupled, and detached intimate ties.  While the tight-knit class corresponds with a companionate model of intimate relations, the other two represent alternatives associated with lower levels of relationship commitment.  Loosely coupled relationships are generally nonexclusive yet still involve a degree of dyadic attachment.  Conversely, detached relationships are exclusive, like tight-knit relationships, but incorporate little emotional attachment.  Analyses of the determinants show that membership in the loosely coupled and the detached alternatives are organized, to some extent, by differences in attitudes, social opportunities, relationship characteristics, and race/ethnicity.  This research demonstrates the significance of the social organization of intimacy by traditional social structures, like marriage and social networks, and by the structure of cohesive practices."
0,"Does the race of inter-viewers introduce a bias in estimating the test score gap between blacks and whites in the United States? To answer this question, I use an adult sample from the General Social Survey (GSS) in which vocabulary testing involves face-to-face and one-on-one interaction between the respondent and the interviewer, I find that black respondents perform better when tested by a black interviewer as opposed to a white interviewer. For white respondents, however, the race of the interviewer does not have a significant impact on test performance. Because most black respondents are tested by white interviewers in the GSS, the test performance of black respondents is downward biased, and the black-white test score gap is overestimated. "
0,"Longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are used to examine patterns and determinants of migration into neighborhoods of varying racial and ethnic composition. Consistent with spatial assimilation theory, higher income and education facilitate moving into neighborhoods containing proportionally more non-Hispanic whites and, among Latinos, the native-born move to ""More Anglo"" neighborhoods than immigrants. Consistent with place stratification theory, blacks move to neighborhoods with significantly fewer Anglos than do comparable Latinos, and the effect of income on migration into more Anglo neighborhoods is stronger for most minority groups than for Anglos. Latinos differ only slightly from Anglos in their migration into neighborhoods with large black populations, and blacks do not differ from Anglos in their migration into neighborhoods with large Latino populations."
0,"Recasting Durkheim's ""community of saints"" thesis, the authors argue that the severity of punishment is predicted in part by the prevalence of the deviant behavior of which the deviant stands accused. Although there is some curvilinearity at low levels of prevalence, the relationship is generally negative. Thus, all else equal, where a particular crime is frequent, any punishment applied to it is likely to be mild; conversely, where a crime is infrequent, its punishment ought to be severe. Using hierarchical regression models, the authors support this hypothesis with 1988 homicide conviction and imprisonment decisions in 32 U. S. counties."
0,"Race and social class have persisted in shaping the academic opportunities of US young people as they progress through the educational system, and the mechanisms of the process have largely defied explanation.  This paper investigates a key mechanism, second generation segregation or the effects of within school segregation according to race in core academic courses on students academic achievement and the race gap in achievement at the end of high school.  Newly available nationally representative longitudinal data from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement study, which augments the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) with students high school transcripts.  The effects of school segregation on how far students progress in math and science courses, and on whether they graduate from high school are estimated.  Results indicate that course segregation along racial lines within schools, is associated with lower achievement of minority student and with an larger race gap in academic outcomes in those schools.  Implications and future research areas are discussed."

0,"Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, Waves 1 and 2, this analysis explores the relationship between the presence of a child with a disability and subsequent fertility decisions. Raising a child with a disability can be costly in both economic and emotional terms. It is reasonable, then, to expect that parents of a child with a disability will decide not to have additional children, thus allowing them to dedicate family resources to meeting the needs of that child. A series of regression analyses offer some support for this perspective, though a lack of statistical significance leaves the issue unresolved."
0,"Gender differences in mathematics achievement have important implications for the underrepresentation of women in science. Typically, gender differences in mathematics achievement are thought to emerge at the end of middle school and beginning of high school, yet some studies find differences among younger children. This paper utilizes data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 to analyze differences in a nationally representative sample of kindergartners as they progress from kindergarten to fifth grade. Using quantile regression models to examine gender differences across the distribution, differences are found among students as early as kindergarten. Initially boys are found to do better at the top of the distribution and worse at the bottom, but by third grade boys do as well or better than girls throughout the distribution. The male advantage at the top of the distribution among entering kindergartners is largest among families with high parental education, suggesting that gender dynamics in middle and upper class families have important implications for continuing gender segregation in science occupations. Gender differences for entering kindergartners also vary across race, with Asians exhibiting the largest male advantage at the top of the distribution. In contrast to the overall pattern, among Latino kindergartners girls have an advantage over boys at the top of the distribution. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"In 2005, the American Psychological Association (APA) issued an official brief on lesbian and gay parenting. This brief included the assertion: ""Not a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents"" (p. 15). The present article closely examines this assertion and the 59 published studies cited by the APA to support it. Seven central questions address: (1) homogeneous sampling, (2) absence of comparison groups, (3) comparison group characteristics, (4) contradictory data, (5) the limited scope of children's outcomes studied, (6) paucity of long-term outcome data, and (7) lack of APA-urged statistical power. The conclusion is that strong assertions, including those made by the APA, were not empirically warranted. Recommendations for future research are offered. "
0,"According to both the sociological literature and the child development literature, parenting styles differ by class, including differences in goals and understandings of good parenting, as well as different understandings of unacceptable parenting practices. There are also differences in child maltreatment rates by class, with poor children experiencing higher likelihoods of abuse and neglect.  However, there is disagreement amongst researchers regarding whether these differences in child maltreatment rates reflect relatively benign class-based cultural differences, versus differences in real harm and deprivation related to the stresses of poverty and life in poor neighborhoods.  This paper addresses these questions by looking in depth at parents conceptions of good and bad parenting, and the relationships between understandings and actual tendencies for abuse and neglect.  Based in in-depth interviews with poor and middle-class parents, it finds that cultural comprehensions of bad parenting practices appear to be influenced by education and support services, regardless of parents socioeconomic status, personal histories, or community context.  However, findings also suggest that cultural stances alone cannot fully overcome the dangers and deprivations associated with parenting under conditions of poverty and emotional distress."
0,"This paper discusses the use of popular genre fiction in transforming American comic books.  Since the early nineteen eighties, both mainstream and independent publishers have published comic books designed to reach a broader and supposedly more mature and sophisticated audience than readers of the dominant superhero genre.  From the very beginning, however, this interpretive community has confronted the low status accorded comic books, by what John Fiske calls official culture, as a juvenile and superficial adolescent-male fantasy world.  The general attempt to legitimize comic books generates a tension between a commitment to popular culture and the quest for full legitimacy as an art form.  I explore Alan Moores Watchmen as an ideal type in legitimating comic books through a popular-genre strategy.  The paper also looks at how the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieus concepts of strategic positioning and artistic trajectory might help in understanding the social context of this narrative strategy in the interpretive community of adult and alternative comic books."
0,"This paper combines theories of racial stratification and intergenerational transmissions of (dis)advanges wtith insights from developmental psychology to test hypotheses about how family and inequality in neighborhoods, schools, and peers explains the black-white achievement gap among children at varying developmental stages.  Prior research has found that family socioeconomic status and home environment account for racial achievement gaps among very young children. However, the same set of covariates cannot explain the achievement gaps among adolescents in junior and senior high schools.  We investigate the large unexplained racial achievement gap among these older children by focusing on several additional important clusters of factors: intergenerational resources such as grandparents' education, wealth, and neighborhood characteristics and characteristics of children's neighborhoods, schools, and peers.  We draw data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and its Child Development Supplements (PSID-CDS), the U.S. Census, the Common Core of Data on schools, and the Private School Survey.  We conducted OLS and Oaxaca decomposition analyses. Our results show that these characteristics, when combined with home environment, can statistically explain the differences in the black-white achievement gaps among adolescents.  Different sets of factors are important for explaining gaps among children and youth at different developmental stages."
0,"The prevailing explanatory approach in the sociology of culture is an Archimedean one: it purports to stand outside the substance or content of culture; it claims to be normatively neutral; it looks at its object from the point of view of no-one in particular. By contrast, I argue that a satisfactory scientific explanation of cultural objects, knowledge claims, or systems of ideas may require a normative assessment of the worth of these objects. That an idea is crazy rather than reasonable, a scientific theory true rather than false, a story plausible rather than implausible, an ethical judgment discriminatory rather than fair, are pieces of information about the explananda that one may need to take into account. In turn, this necessitates that one temporarily situates oneself within the universe of discourse under study and conscientiously grapple with the substance or content of culture. In the second section of the paper, I consider in some more detail the special case of the explanation of peoples moral views."
0,"In opposition to the argument that pain is private, personal and unsharable, I propose that the intersubjectivity of pain is fundamental to it.  Using the case of phantom limb, I show how a specific language of pain emerged and became concertized in the US circa 1975 with the advent of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ).  Through widespread use of the MPQ, a language of pain materialized, one that was commonly used to describe the qualitative dimensions of phantom limb.  After 1975, the terminology used within the medical literature was overwhelmingly consonant with the set of descriptors advanced by the MPQ.  The utilization of a pain questionnaire to assess the qualitative dimensions of phantom limb effectively accentuated pain, and by 1980, what was once considered relatively rare became a common sequela of phantom manifestation."
0,"A large body of research has established that combat has negative effects on the mental health of soldiers, resulting in PTSD and a wide range of related mental health problems. However, very little research examines what effects non-combat military service may have on the mental health of men. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) we show that men who serve on active duty, and do not see combat, are less likely to experience depressive symptoms than their nonveteran and reserve duty counterparts, although this effect tends to dissipate after discharge from the military. We suggest several mechanisms through which active duty military service may act to reduce the likelihood of developing depressive symptoms. "
0,"This paper examines the role of collective identity, diffusion, and transnationalism in campus Muslim sectarian politics in the United States.  The city of Springfield has a significant Shi’a Muslim presence, but Sunni Muslims lead the Muslim organization at the local university.  In 2005, a Shi’a organization emerged on this campus.  Why did the Shi’a organization emerge in 2005 and not earlier, given Shi’a students’ numerical majority and strong local institutions?  Does the salience of sects in Springfield have anything to do with sectarian violence in Iraq? Interviews were conducted with Sunni and Shi’a students who were on campus at some point over the period of the mid-1990s-2007.  The birth of the Shi’a organization in 2005 may appear to have happened “late” when considering the demographics of the community.  Interview data indicate, however, that the construction and mobilization of ethno-religious identities, the diffusion of the national Shi’a organization’s model, and the increased media discourse on Muslim sects explain the transition on campus from a time in the mid-1990s in which sectarian issues were not salient to one in which they were very salient."
0,"The U.S. Latino population has grown rapidly over the last two decades. The pace of population growth, and the fact that Latino communities have sprung up in many states and regions without a prior history of significant Latino presence, has brought increased attention to the group. There has been speculation about the effects of growing populations that are neither black nor white, and Latinos in particular, on racial status hierarchies in the United States. Some predict a growing Latino population reduces racial polarization, while others, notably, Herbert Gans, argue that instead this will cause a shift in the axis of race relations, from a dominant white/non-white divide, to a black/non-black divide. These arguments are yet to be evaluated empirically. This paper seeks to fill that gap. It studies the frames and discourse of newspaper coverage of Latinos over a decade and a half of rapid Latino population growth. The paper identifies and gives a precise analysis of the status of Latinos in the cultural grid that defines race in the contemporary U.S."
0,"This paper studies the influence of state, workplace, and family support on the working hours of employed mothers and how these different support sources interact. Data taken from the European Social Survey 2004/2005 as well as country-specific information were used to estimate several hierarchical models. We find evidence that the availability of supportive workplace arrangements and family support positively impact the working hours of employed mothers and that state policies facilitating the traditional family have a negative effect. There is weak support for a positive relationship between state policies facilitating the dual-earner family and working hours of employed mothers. In addition, most of the sources of support appear to be complementary. Supportive family role models and supportive workplace arrangements have a reinforcing relationship, as do publicly funded child care and supportive workplace arrangements. "
0,"This research examines two factors that have an impact on the self-esteem of African Americans and whites: religion and socioeconomic status (SES). Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, we find that for whites, belief in the Bible (i.e., that it is the literal word of God) and self-identifying as fundamentalist were significant predictors of self-esteem. For African Americans, belief in the Bible and being Catholic were significant predictors of self-esteem. However, the association between belief in the Bible and self-esteem was stronger for African Americans than whites. SES was positively associated with self-esteem for both groups. The interactions between SES and the measures of religiosity reveal a greater impact on self-esteem for lower SES respondents. This was especially true for African Americans. These findings are discussed in light of the resource compensation hypothesis."
0,"This study is an ethnographic exploration of how African American teenagers at an inner city summer camp construct masculinity and femininity. The inner city program provides a context in which gender is particularly salient. Analysis is based on observations of 65 boys and girls and interviews with 20 boys and girls. Building off of Connell and Ridgeway and Corrells gender theories, the author finds a divide in masculinity practices between older and younger boys not addressed in previous research. The author also identifies three distinct types of femininity practices: one that is acquiescent to male privilege, one that is resistant in order to protect girls from potential abuse, and one in which girls attempt to establish power by negotiating within their heterosexual relationships."
0,"Accumulating evidence from behavioral genetics suggests that the vast majority of individual-level outcomes of abiding sociological interest are genetically influenced to a substantial degree. This raises the question of the place of genetics in social science explanations. Genomic causation is described from a counterfactualist perspective, which makes its complexity plain and highlights the distinction between identifying causes and substantiating explanations. For explanation, genomic causes must be understood as strictly mediated by the body. One implication is that the challenge of behavioral genetics for sociology is much more a challenge from psychology than biology, and a main role for genetics is as a placeholder for ignorance of more proximate influences of psychological and other embodied variation. Social scientists should not take this challenge from psychology as suggesting any especially fundamental explanatory place for either it or genetics, but the contingent importance of genetic and psychological characteristics is itself available for sociological investigation."
0,"In this paper we address a puzzle in contemporary income inequality – a reverse long-term trend toward a decline in labor's share of national income and a rise in the capitalists’ profits share.  As a first step towards unraveling this puzzle, we provide a first detailed description of labor’s share in U.S. industries over the postwar period, revealing a large decline in core industries (i.e., construction, manufacturing, and transportation) since the early 1970s, with a small rise in labor's share within FIRE and services industries.  The downward trend in some industries and the upward trend in others sums up to a decline of “only” six percentage points in the overall distribution of labor’s share.  We further show that the decline in labor’s share was largely due to a decline within industries, while changes in the sectorial composition of output played only a minor role.  Our aim in the core part of this paper is to explain the dynamics of labor's share within industries.  For that purpose we develop a theoretical framework that draws links between workers' relative bargaining power, technological change, and income distribution.  We then combine data drawn from the BEA Industry Economic Accounts, Annual Survey of Manufactures, the Census of Manufactures, and CPS to provide a first rigorous test for the independent effects of computer technology, unionization, capital concentration, import penetration, and unemployment on changes in labor’s share within 46 private industries and 458 manufacturing industries between 1968 and 2002."
0,"Efforts to develop a unified model of collective violence have been limited by the diverse array of events analyzed, from terrorist attacks to riots. This article seeks to develop a more inclusive theoretical and analytic framework by exploring the targets of violence, something that has received little disaggregated attention. We argue that consideration of who or what is targeted during the course of an event, together with collectivity size and the conditional role it may play, offers new theoretical insight into collective violence dynamics. Our analysis draws from newspaper records on a diverse range of collectivities, from parties to rallies to riots. We find that in many contexts, collectivity size increases the likelihood of violence against some targets, notably state actors, while reducing attacks on others. These findings provide the basis for a broader discussion of why unpacking targets is so critical to understanding the dynamics of collective violence."
0,"Women have made significant inroads into management in recent decades, yet remain underrepresented in leadership positions in large firms. In this article, I assess the critical but seldom analyzed role that widespread corporate restructuring may play in generating these inequalities. I build on social-cognitive research and the opportunity structure for discrimination framework to develop contrasting predictions of the effects from two forms of restructuring-reductions in force and reorganization of human resource management systems-on sex differences in managerial promotion. Analyses of longitudinal personnel records from a Fortune 500 manufacturing firm-a firm that restructured multiple times over the period examined-are consistent with the opportunity structure for discrimination framework and suggest that the firm responded to gender equity pressures to promote women when afforded the opportunity to do so. Women promotion rates were higher than men during restructuring, relative to previous years, with a greater difference at higher-status job levels. Importantly, however few women transitioned into upper management positions in the firm during the restructuring period because (1) reductions in force slowed promotion rates for all managers, (2) women began their careers in lower-status jobs to begin with, relative to men, and (3) women promotion advantages were often short-lived. I conclude by discussing implications of my findings for research on organizational dynamics and gender inequality."
0,"Humor is a significant weapon in interpersonal and intergroup conflict and competition. Over the centuries, males have used humor and jokes to create and perpetuate patriarchal ideals, relationships, and structures. Today, feminists and other proponents of gender equality use humor to deconstruct patriarchal ideologies and sexist stereotypes. This exploratory study analyzes a collection of over 1,700 jokes identified as feminist and women's humor to discover what these jokes suggest with regard to the male-dominant structure in society and how these jokes are subversive in attempting to disrupt gender stereotypes and roles. We find that the humor of women and feminists seeks, in part, to discredit assumptions of males' superiority, masterfulness, sexual prowess, and extraordinary value to women and society. These jokes may, however, also work to reinforce stereotypes associated with men and women:"
0,"This study examines the relationship between students’ college readiness and how their high school experiences contribute to their college plans. An increasing percentage of students expect to attend college, but many lack the abilities and characteristics to make the transition successfully. Using preliminary data from a quasi-experimental intervention study in urban and rural high schools in Michigan, this study looks at the alignment of college preparedness and college ambitions among entering high school seniors. Among 352 sampled high school seniors, half expect to attend a four-year college, but do not exhibit the academic abilities found among successful college students. The alignment of ambitions also differs significantly by gender and school geography. These findings and the negative implications of selling unprepared students the dream of college provide the impetus for implementation and evaluation of the College Ambition Program, an evidence-based college access and preparation intervention model."
0,"The concept of generations can be employed quite effectively in immigrant acculturation research, especially when it incorporates key insights from life course theory. This is evidenced in theoretical and empirical studies of intergenerational and life course processes. In this paper, I consider linkages between theories of generations and of the life course, with the aim of developing a firm conceptualization and operationalization of generations for use in my dissertation research on mechanisms of intergenerational cultural and religious transmission in Palestinian Muslim American immigrant families."
0,"The question of the extent to which Durkheim's argument in Division of Labor in Society is continuous with or radically departs from the work of Herbert Spencer has been the subject of a long-standing debate. In this article, the author revisits this issue in light of recent scholarship that points to the pervasive role of the notions of ""representation"" and ""dualism"" in Durkheim's overall thought. The analysis shows that Durkheim's conception of the rise of individualism is significantly different from that of Spencer, precisely because it is based on idiosyncratic concepts with no analogue in Spencer's system. Because of this difference, Durkheim's critique of Spencer largely misses the mark and in fact requires an ambiguous projection of Durkheim's own theory-laden notion of individualism toward Spencer, in order to suggest that Spencer begs the question. The author concludes that Durkheim and Spencer had largely incommensurable ideas as to the primary consequence of the division of labor: the rise of ""individualism."" This necessitates the analytical distinction between the two conceptions of "" the individual,"" which I label the ""bio-psychological"" and the ""sociological."""
0,"The present study applies social disorganization theory to examine the community context of social control and adolescent delinquency in Iceland. Application of this theory has been limited outside of United States and Britain. In addition to clarifying the cross-cultural validity of this approach, the study contributes to research on the mechanisms through which community structure influences adolescent delinquency, focusing on interlocking networks, adolescent normlessness, and unstructured peer activity. Multi-level analysis of 6402 adolescents in 68 communities (schools) reveals a contextual influence of community social instability (residential instability and family disruption) on adolescent property crime, an effect moderated by the community socioeconomic status. Moreover, both interlocking networks and adolescent normlessness help to account for a part of these effects. Finally, interlocking networks moderate the influence of unstructured peer activity on property crime, underscoring the contingent effects of routine activity patterns on opportunity and motivation for offending. These findings are strengthened by the fact that we are able to control for prior community rates of offending. In conclusion, the study lends support the cross-cultural validity of social disorganization theory, while underscoring that its theoretical implications are sensitive to societal context."
0,"We replicate and extend John Shelton Reed's classic work on regional identification by examining and modeling the prevalence of the words ""Dixie"" and ""Southern"" in business names across 100 cities and four decades. We find that the instances of ""Dixie"" have dropped precipitously, although identification with the word ""Southern"" has remained more constant, providing evidence of a trend we term re-southernization. We also find that the relative number of blacks in the population provides the most consistent explanation of regional identity. Population density has also emerged as a significant predictor of regional identification in more recent time periods. These findings contribute to the literature on regional identification, the politics of naming and the sociology of the South."
0,"AIDS media lead unexpected lives once distributed through urban space: billboards fade, posters go missing, bumper stickers travel to other cities. The materiality of AIDS campaign objects and of the urban settings in which they are displayed structures how the public interprets their messages. Ethnographic observation of AIDS media in situ and interview data reveal how the materiality of objects and places shapes the availability of AIDS knowledge in Accra, Ghana. Significantly for AIDS organizations, these material conditions often systematically obstruct access to AIDS knowledge for particular groups. Attending to materiality rethinks how scholars assess the cultural power of media."
0,"Previous studies have shown that as the percent black or percent Hispanic grows, that group's residential segregation from whites tends to increase as well. Typically, these findings are explained in terms of white discriminatory reaction to the perceived threat associated with minority population growth. The present analysis examines whether these racial threat effects depend on the extent of racial and ethnic diversity in an area. This possibility is tested by estimating otherwise standard models of black-white and Hispanic-white segregation using metropolitan area data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. censuses. Results from robust regression analyses strongly support the prediction for each of the white-minority pairs: the racial threat effect is significantly diminished in areas with greater multi-ethnic diversity."
0,"In an increasingly knowledge-based global environment, American-style economics may be an especially important form of expertise to understand. Existing studies of the discipline present something of a paradox, however, as some suggest that economic discourse is a logically unified and powerful promarket ideology, while others indicate that in practice it is quite fragmented and constrained. Aseries of 52 interviews with economists working in various jobs is used to reveal a possible way out of this paradox by highlighting three basic features of economic expertise: cognitive and practical framing via a ""core"" of relatively simple ideas and techniques, great flexibility in results due to various available ""subframes,"" and dependence of the selection of subframes on local institutional contexts. These underlying features potentially explain how the unified academic discourse of economics produces a variety of outcomes and maybe even plays a range of quite different social roles in different situations."
0,"Much has been written about modern Cuba's problems, but little about what it means to be part of a society that believes in ""the Revolution"" and the possibility of a new order. The challenge is not only to understand why some Cubans do not believe but to also recognize the commitment of those who do. Based on how they identify key events in Cuban history, we focus on two distinct generations of Cuban women: an older ""Revolution"" generation and a younger ""Special Period"" generation. Analyzing transcripts from in-depth focus group conversations and face-to-face interviews, we argue that depending on their historical location, Cuban women differ both within and between generations in terms of their sociopolitical world views, especially in how they conceptualize their place in the Revolution and in their strategies of resistance throughout Cuba's current economic crisis, a period known by Cubans as the Special Period. Their words describe in detail what their beliefs mean to them, and how they live them."
0,"This study theorizes and analyzes how shareholder power manifests in an organizational field of the largest U.S. firms by observing dismissal events of CEO (chief executive officer) in 1985-2007. Building on neoinstitutional theory, I argue that institutional logics define a category of corporate practices with normative imperative status and that CEOs are enforced to implement these practices through the negative sanction of dismissal. In the context of the rise of shareholder power, this research hypothesizes the dismissal of underperforming CEOs as a result of organizational misalignment with the shareholder value logic that institutional investors came up with in the field over the course of the 1980s hostile takeover wave. As expected, the results show that CEOs promoting a set of corporate refocusing practices in allegiance to the shareholder value logic have been better able to avoid dismissal when firm performance deteriorates. But they do not support previous studies predicting that institutional ownership concentration and board independence will increase the effect of firm performance on the likelihood of CEO dismissal. In conclusion, this study reveals the political-cultural mechanism through which shareholder power manifests at organizational field-level. That is, institutional investors have controlled corporate management by embodying their ideal of the efficient firm (i.e., shareholder value logic) in the power relations among field players."
0,"Researchers have argued for longitudinal studies that focus more attention on how religious attitudes and behaviors change during adolescence and, especially, as adolescents make the transition to young adulthood. Therefore, the authors use growth curve modeling to examine the influence of parents and peers on adolescent religious service attendance and belief in the importance of religion using five waves (eight years) of the National Youth Survey (1979-1987). The results suggest adolescents who live with both of their biological parents have higher initial levels of religious service attendance, but their religious service attendance decreases more rapidly over time. The pattern of results for peer attachment is similar. Compared to adolescents with low peer attachment, adolescents with high peer attachment are more likely to attend religious services initially and to believe that religion is important, but their religious service attendance and belief in the importance of religion decreases more rapidly over time."
0,"This paper examines how members of a southeastern Metropolitan Community Church constructed an inclusive congregational identity.  Data are taken from 150 hours of participant observation, informal interviews, and organizational documents gathered in the field.  I identify four processes of congregational identity construction: (1) adopting denominational frames of inclusion; (2) staging the church setting as symbolically inclusive; (3) scripting formal rules and rituals to signify inclusion; and (4) enacting inclusion via informal interaction rituals.  This paper contributes to the sociology of religion by demonstrating the usefulness of an identity work perspective to the study of congregations."
0,"Retrospective narratives of change consistently emphasize the importance of religious devotion and spirituality in initiating sustained behavioral change, but little is known about the process by which religion and spirituality promote desistance from crime. The current project is designed to add to the knowledge of the relationship between religion/spirituality and behavioral change by systematically investigating the ways that men residing in a halfway house define the role of religion/spirituality as an emotion-coping mechanism in their desistance efforts. The qualitative data reveal that religion/spirituality is primarily used by these men currently undergoing behavioral change as a form of emotional comfort, a distraction from current stressors, and as factor demarcating the transition from deviance to a more conventional life. Suggestions for religious programming designed to stimulate behavioral changes are discussed."
0,"What led modern colonizers to treat their subject populations in radically differing ways, ranging from genocide to efforts to ""salvage"" precolonial cultures? In Southwest Africa, Germany massacred the Ovaherero and Witbooi; in Samoa, Germany pursued a program of cultural retraditionalization; and in the Chinese leasehold colony of Qingdao/Kiaochow. the Germans moved from policies of racialized segregation to a respectful civilizational exchange. Bourdieu is not generally seen as a theorist of empire, despite the partial genesis of his lifelong research program in the late colonial crucible of French Algeria (Bourdieu 1958; Yacine 2004). Nonetheless, Bourdieu theoretical work-most notably his conceptions of field and capital-helps solve the main riddle of the colonial state. Different European social groups competed inside the colonial state field for a specific form of symbolic capital: ethnographic capital. This involved exhibiting an alleged talent for judging the culture and character of the colonized, a gift for understanding ""the natives."" Competitive dynamics among the colonial rulers decisively shaped the ongoing production of native policies. Policy formation was also influenced by geopolitical and economic interests, responses by the colonized, and the metropolitan government final authority in appointing and dismissing colonial officials. The effects of these additional mechanisms were typically mediated by the internal dynamics of the semi-autonomous colonial state."
0,"This article examines the neighborhood characteristics that affect bias crime and compares bias crime to other kinds of criminal offending. Two frequently asserted arguments are tested. The first argument is that bias crime is like other criminal offenses in that it is more likely to occur in communities with high levels of social disorganization. The second argument is that bias crime is unique in that it occurs as a defense against neighborhood in-migration of ethnic ""others""-the so-called ""defended neighborhoods"" argument. Findings show that accounting for the spatial distribution of bias crime requires both perspectives. Bias crime, like robbery, assault, and vandalism, is more likely to occur in neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage and residential turnover, two of the three factors identified in social disorganization research. However, unlike other kinds of crime, holding constant attributes of disorganization, the effect of nonwhite in-migration on bias crime is greater in neighborhoods with a high percentage of white residents than communities with a low percentage of white residents. This confirms the central empirical implication of the defended neighborhoods perspective. Additional analyses show that these effects hold in analyses of specifically anti-black bias crimes and violent bias crimes. The conclusion suggests that research on social problems like bias crime should balance the emphasis on the unique features of the problem with attention to the common generative processes that the problem shares with a wider set of behaviors and outcomes."
0,"This article moves beyond current controversies on the nature of money by suggesting that a general social process allows different kinds of organizations and networks-from states to banks to local communities-to produce currencies: that is, the articulation of criteria of creditworthiness, or what I call the exercise of moral authority. Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is contested, challenging groups must articulate alternative criteria of creditworthiness for their currencies to become stable and acceptable. I illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum United States, which I use to discuss why the federal government failed to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral authority, which have made the local level a springboard for destabilizing financial innovations."
0,"As the financial economy has expanded since 1980, it has done so in part by selling more products to individuals and households, such as mortgages, second mortgages, mutual funds, student loans, car loans, insurance, and various forms of retirement products. This has allowed households access to new forms of assets and debts and new ways to fund their lifestyles. This giant expansion of the financial services sector occurred at the same time that income inequality and job insecurity increased dramatically in the U.S. This paper seeks to tease out empirically the relationship between these trends by examining data on the activities of households in the past 30 years. There are two views, one that focuses on how households reacted defensively to preserve their lifestyles and the other which focuses on households developing a more financial mindset to the management of their assets, debt, and consumption and thereby using the new opportunities to invest and borrow money to increase their consumption. At its core, this project seeks to understand a) how different types of households came to adopt this new financial culture during the past 30 years, and b) how these patterns of change in consumption, debt, and assets were related to the changing structure of economic inequality."
0,"Using national data of the male population (a total of 715,000 observations) in Taiwan, this study finds a significant association between LBW and the probability of committing crime appears exclusively among those born to mothers under 18 or over 40 at the time of childbearing. Moreover, this association occurs particularly in violent crime. The interaction between biological and demographic factors suggests that being born to very old or young mothers and LBW together may create a double hazard of biological disadvantage, leading to higher risk of committing violent crime later. The other side of the coin is that, regarding to violent crime, being born low birth weight may not be a disadvantage unless it is triggered by certain adversity. "
0,"The research presented here weighs the ability of two major explanations of social inequality-Massey and Denton's racial segregation explanation and Wilson's emphasis on economic deprivation (concentrated poverty)-to predict environmental inequality. Two sets of logistic regression analyses are used to predict the location of Superfund sites in Portland, Oregon and Detroit, Michigan providing a conditional understanding of environmental inequality within a larger sociological context. The analysis includes a general examination of the two theories in all census tracts in both cities and a set of analyses focusing upon Black neighborhoods in Detroit. The findings indicate that there is support for explanations of environmental inequality that include both racial segregation and economic deprivation, but that the more powerful of the two is economic deprivation. The results suggest that even though African-American neighborhoods disproportionately house Superfund sites, these facilities are more likely to be located in Black neighborhoods that are economically deprived.

0,"Recent increases in births to unmarried parents, and the instability surrounding these relationships, have raised concerns about the possible health effects associated with changes in family structure. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (N = 2,448), this article examines trajectories of maternal mental and physical health. We specifically focus on mothers' transitions into and out of residential relationships with a child biological father during the first five years after birth. We find that continuously married mothers are in better mental and physical health than unmarried mothers one year after birth, but the disparity does not increase over time. This finding provides little support for the resource model. Consistent with the crisis model, exiting a marital or cohabiting union increases mental health problems and decreases self-rated health. These effects appear to be relatively short-lived, though, and they are stronger for mental health than for self-rated health. The results also suggest that union dissolution may be selective of less healthy mothers, whereas union formation does not appear to be selective of healthier mothers."
0,"In this paper, I make a case for the importance of social movement sequencing and of the unintended consequences of a social movement in the Eastern European transitions of 1989. I show that the Esperanto movement, the most important transnational social movement in Eastern Europe in the 1980s in terms of number of organizations, served as a primer in creating a widespread cosmopolitan disposition among Eastern Europeans in the years preceding 1989. I speculate that such a cosmopolitan disposition made Eastern Europeans more likely to engage in the protest events of 1989 and favor democratization. I develop a comparative design and present evidence from various sources, including a longitudinal dataset on transnational social movement organizations around the world, the World Value Survey, data on movement membership and reach, and semi-structured interviews with members of the Esperanto movement in four Eastern European countries."
0,"While individuals returning from prison face many barriers to successful re-entry, among the most serious are the challenges they face in securing housing. Housing has long been recognized as a prerequisite for stable employment, access to social services, and other aspects of individual and family functioning. The formerly incarcerated face several administrative and de facto restrictions on their housing options; however, little is known about the unique instabilities that they face. We use a longitudinal survey of urban families to examine housing insecurity among nearly 3000 urban men, including over 1000 with incarceration histories. We find that men recently incarcerated face greater housing insecurity, including both serious hardships such as homelessness, and precursors to homelessness such as residential turnover and relying on others for housing expenses. Their increased risk is tied both to diminished annual earnings and other factors, including, potentially, evictions from public housing supported by Federal ""one-strike"" policies. "
0,"This article uses the puzzle of Christian success in Korea to develop a model for understanding religious diffusion beyond national borders. The authors argue that the microlevel network explanations that dominate the research on conversion cannot by themselves account for the unusual success of Protestantism in Korea. Instead, events in East Asia in macrolevel, geopolitical networks provoked nationalist rituals that altered the stakes of conversion to either promote or retard conversion network growth. At the turn of the 20th century, unequal treaties both opened this region to missionaries and provoked nationalist rituals. In China and Japan, these rituals generated patriotic identities by attacking Christianity, and network growth slowed or reversed. In Korea, Christianity became compatible with these rituals, and conversion networks grew. This example highlights the greater explanatory power of nested networks for understanding international religious diffusion, relative to microlevel accounts alone."
0,"Despite the scale, reach, and global impact of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), its study has remained largely at the purview of various micro-level analyses (e.g., <link rid=""b28"">Gutmann 2007; <link rid=""b38"">Levi and Vitoria 2002). However, differences in prevalence rates at the national level suggest that other forces might be at work. Following the work of <link rid=""b45"">McIntosh and Thomas (2004), the only cross-national study of HIV/AIDS published to our knowledge, we conduct a cross-national analysis that examines world polity ideas that higher levels of health and women's non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should be associated with lower levels of HIV prevalence. Initially, we find no support for these hypotheses. However, we respecify our models to test a political opportunity structure hypothesis that democracy enhances the ability of health and women's NGOs to deal with HIV. We test this line of reasoning by including an interaction term between democracy and the health and women's NGO variables. In doing so, we find that health and women's NGOs are associated with lower levels of HIV prevalence in democratic rather than repressive nations."
0,"In the era of consumer capitalism, is there any such thing as music that is produced outside of the culture industry?  The distinction between mass culture and local or independently made culture is central to musicians evaluations of their craft and to sociologists analyses of music making. This paper questions the salience of this distinction.  It is an ethnographic project on the music scene of a small college town that has lofty aims as the self-proclaimed center of the musical universe.  Its thriving local scene is generated in large part by the financial and social capital of a group of local rock musicians and entrepreneurs who have gained national fame in the music industry.  These men have invested their capital back into the local economy, tying their businesses to the citys experiments in new urbanism.   At the same time, other music businesses and organizations form to resist the monopoly these men have on the scene.  I argue that the tension between local monopoly and local resistance generates important resources for rock musicians and young college alumni entering into culture industry professions.  Yet at the same time, those who play other genres such as metal, hip-hop and Latin music are sidelined within the local economy.  As cultural resources are becoming synonymous with economic resources, access to making local culture is a new indicator of existing social inequalities in urban spaces."
0,"This article examines the process through which the state nurtured urban middle-class formation during the Park Chung Hee regime in South Korea. While existing studies have focused on the size and characteristics of the middle class, few studies explore the political process or mechanisms through which the middle class was on the rise as a mainstream force. This article argues that urban middle-class formation was a politicalideological project of the authoritarian state to reconstruct the nation and strengthen the regimes political legitimacy. In particular, this article explores the two concurrent processes of urban middle-class formation in Korea: one is the growth of the middle class in an objective sense, as a result of state-directed economic development; and the other is the production of urban middle-class norms. Drawing on the discourses of the Korean government and the media disseminated during from 1961 to 1979, I trace how the formation of the middle class in Korea was intertwined with modernity and nationalism in order to consolidate state power."
0,"Using data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada Wave One, this paper compares the labor market outcomes of recently-arrived immigrant engineers by the region of their highest education obtained abroad.  The data suggest that immigrants who obtained education in the countries that have agreements with Canada on the accreditation of engineering degree are more likely to work in engineering or managerial occupations, and earn higher weekly wages when other factors are not controlled.  In contrast, most of the internationally-educated engineers, particularly individuals educated in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, are in lower skill occupations and fare less well.  However, once other factors such as language of instruction and presence of job arrangement are controlled, the effects of place of education on occupations become insignificant.  In addition, the effects of place of education on earnings turn insignificant or barely significant once current occupations are controlled.  Factors that may explain these findings include: devaluation of foreign credentials because of the language of instruction; systemic barriers that devalue education from particular regions; and limited access to highly-paid jobs."
0,"Researchers claim that increasing economic inequality in the United States is associated with increasing economic insecurity for workers and families. We propose a model of family economic insecurity, borrowing statistics for financial risk. With longitudinal data on family incomes, we estimate a regression on panel data for realized variances, a longitudinal measure of volatility that separates positive and negative shifts in a time series. Analyzing SIPP data we find that large negative shifts are most common in single-earners, and single-parent families."
0,"In this article, the authors examine participation in protests about homelessness by an unlikely set of participants-the homeless themselves. Through an analysis of data derived from 400 structured interviews with homeless individuals in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Tucson, the authors examine why and to what extent some homeless individuals, and not others, participate in movement-sponsored protest activities. In addition, the authors assess the degree to which the factors that affect participation in this population align with previous research on participation in social movements generally. They find that certain characteristics of the homeless population reduce the importance of social ties with other homeless individuals in the recruitment process and that, contrary to what much past work would lead one to expect, homeless individuals who are less biographically available are more likely to engage in protest activity. In addition, strain, which is often not a significant predictor of engagement in other populations, is an important predictor of differential participation among the homeless. This study highlights features of the homeless population that yield somewhat different correlates of participation than found in most movement participation studies and, in turn, cautions against presuming an overall model of participation that explains the engagement of all groups in the same way."
0,"As survey response rates decline, correlates of survey participation may also be changing. Panel studies provide an opportunity to study a rich set of correlates of panel attrition over time. We look at changes in attrition rates in the American National Election Studies from 1964 to 2004, a repeated panel survey with a two-wave pre-post election design implemented over multiple decades. We examine changes in attrition rates by three groups of variables: sociodemographic and ecological characteristics of the respondent and household, party affiliation and political and social attitudes recorded at the first interview, and paradata about the first wave interview. We find relatively little overall change in the pre-post election panel attrition rates, but important changes in demographic correlates of panel attrition over time. We also examine contact and cooperation rates from 1988 to 2004. "
0,"There exists a well-established relationship between sexual minority status and worse mental health. This literature, however, is largely based on cross-sectional, clinical and community samples.  Furthermore, it often fails to incorporate differential sexual identity developmental trajectories into its models.  This paper addresses these limitations by using a large, longitudinal nationally representative sample to examine how the timing and patterns of sexual minority status identification influences both self-reported depression and suicidal thoughts.  I find that those female respondents who delay sexual minority status identification experience increased suicidal thought as adolescents as well as young adults, while those individuals who transition out of sexual minority status experience no future adverse mental health outcomes. Among boys, in adolescents, identifying as a sexual minority, whether they transition in or out of this status is associated with increased suicidal thoughts.  In adulthood, however, only those who delay have increased risk.  These findings highlight the importance of including the timing and pattern of sexual identity development as an important mechanism through which mental health can be improved.  Public policies should not only focus on helping those individuals who have already identified sexual minorities access and utilize mental health resources, but ensure that resources are in place to help facilitate the coming out process for sexual minorities who are beginning or wish to identify as sexual minorities."
0,"The segregation of jobs is a key contributor to demographic wage inequality, and is an issue of concern to any organization working to comply with equal employment opportunity guidelines.  Recommendations to organizations for reducing job segregation have focused on personnel decisions regarding hiring, promotion, and turnover.  This focus on personnel decisions starting at application ignores the role organizations play in generating their applicants via referrals.  Referrals often comprise as much as 50% of applicants, and organizations influence the degree to which this form of recruitment is encouraged. Still, referral processes have been neglected as an opportunity for organizations to reduce job segregation.  This paper builds upon a uniquely detailed empirical dataset to construct a series of virtual experiments using a computationally simulated job pipeline.  We investigate the components of referral processes over which organizations have influence, and evaluate their relative contribution to job segregation outcomes.  We find that under a wide range of reasonable scenarios, referral processes not only are important contributors to job segregation, but can exceed the segregating impact of subjective biases in personnel decisions.  In fact, even absent any demographic biases in personnel decisions, referral processes can perpetuate and even exacerbate the segregation of a job."
0,"Multi-level analyses of data on 18,519 families with opposite sex children from NFHS-3 are used to test the impact of maternal son preference and context on the gender differential in education in India. The results show that girls are at a greater educational disadvantage compared to their brothers in families with maternal son preference. Mother's education is shown to reduce the effect of son preference and to reduce the bias against daughters. Additionally, there is more gender inequality in education in communities with high levels of maternal son preference and low women's status. Importantly, a family's location in a community or region with higher women's status explains much of the effect of maternal son preference on the gender disparity. The importance of context is further solidified by significant interaction effects showing that the negative effect of mother's education is modified by context."
0,"After reaching their highest levels of the 20th century, homicide rates ill the United States declined precipitously in the early 1990s. This study examines a number of factors that might have contributed to both the sharp increase and decline in homicide rates. We Use a pooled cross-sectional time series model to assess the relationship between changes in structural conditions and the change in homicide rates over four decennial time points (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000). We assess the extent to which structural covariates associated with social, economic and political conditions commonly used in homicide research (e.g., urban decay, poverty, and the weakening of family and social bonds) are related to the change in homicide rates. Along with these classic covariates, we incorporate some contemporary explanations (e.g., imprisonment rates and drug trafficking) that have been proposed to address the recent decline in urban homicide rates. Our results indicate that both classic and contemporary explanations are related to homicide trends over the last three decades of the 20th century. Specifically, changes in resource deprivation and in the relative size of the youth population are associated with changes in the homicide rate across these time points. Increased imprisonment is also significantly related to homicide changes. These findings lead US to Conclude that efforts to understand the changing nature of homicide will require serious consideration, if not integration, of classic and contemporary explanations. "
0,"To better understand persistent racial inequality in occupational mobility, we examine the influence of race and social capital on the promotions of 320 assistant college football coaches. The results from quantitative analyses demonstrate that social capital matters a great deal for promotions, but its impact is contingent on the race of the respondent. Specifically, network connections to heterogeneous contacts (racially heterophilous ties, weak ties, and high-status ties) appear to be more effective for black coaches than for white coaches. The findings underscore the importance and complexity of the relationships between race, social capital, and occupational mobility."
0,"This article describes both sociological and genetic theories of illness causation and derives propositions expected under each and under a transdisciplinary theoretical frame. The authors draw propositions from three theories-fundamental causes, social stress processes, and social safety net theories-and tailor hypotheses to the case of alcohol dependence. Analyses of a later wave of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism reveal a complex interplay of the GABRA2 gene with social structural factors to produce cases meeting DSM/ICD diagnoses. Only modest evidence suggests that genetic influence works through social conditions and experiences. Further, women are largely unaffected in their risk for alcohol dependence by allele status at this candidate gene; family support attenuates genetic influence; and childhood deprivation exacerbates genetic predispositions. These findings highlight the essential intradisciplinary tension in the role of proximal and distal influences in social processes and point to the promise of focusing directly on dynamic, networked sequences that produce different pathways to health and illness."
0,"Despite decades of research on the benefits of educational expectations, researchers have failed to show that unrealized plans are consequential for mental health, as self-discrepancy and other social psychological theories would predict. This article uses two national longitudinal studies of youth to test whether unrealized educational expectations are associated with depression in adulthood. Negative binomial regression analyses show that unmet expectations are associated with a greater risk of depression among young adults who share similar educational expectations. The apparent consequences of aiming high and falling short result, however, from lower attainment, not the gap between plans and attainment. Results indicate almost no long-term emotional costs of ""shooting for the stars'' rather than planning for the probable, once educational attainment is taken into account. This lack of association also holds after accounting for early mental health, the magnitude of the shortfall, the stability of expectations, and college-related resources, and it is robust across two distinct cohorts of high school students. We develop a theory of ""adaptive resilience'' to account for these findings and, because aiming high and failing are not consequential for mental health, conclude that society should not dissuade unpromising students from dreams of college."
0,"In this paper we examine whether racial and ethnic stereotypes and attitudes are associated with views toward drug addiction.  Using data from the General Social Survey (1990 and 2000) and utilizing logistic regression analysis, our results show that such stereotypes are related to attitudes toward spending on drug addiction.  Specifically, our results show that the perceived violence proneness of Blacks and of Latinos, but not of Whites, is associated with an increased likelihood of saying that spending on drug addiction is inadequate.  People who have exposure to Blacks (i.e., Blacks reside in their neighborhoods) are less likely to say too little is spent.  Furthermore, these findings are robust even when taking into account more traditional forms of prejudice, other spending attitudes and a host of control variables.  This suggests that drug addiction is color coded as a Black and Latino phenomenon."
0,"I designed an experiment to test predictions, derived from expectation states theories, that the unequal allocation Of social rewards among collective task-focused actors will affect the actors' rates of power and prestige behavior. Past research shows that allocations Of exchangeable resources can have these effects. The prediction, however, is general and applies to groups where distributed rewards possess only status value. Consistent with predictions, participants who received a fictitious title and a special certificate inviting them to attend an ""exclusive private reception"" as an honored guest resisted influence more and evaluated themselves as more capable compared to participants whose partners received the title, certificate and invitation. I discuss implications of this research for status construction theories, which invoke the processes I examine to describe how new status characteristics could emerge in a society."
0,"Given the significant increase in the number of women and girls participating in sport, it is now a commonly held belief that girls have ample opportunities to participate in sport and, consequently, that girls who do not participate choose to do so because they simply lack interest in sport. Using qualitative methodologies and the sociology of accounts, the author examines a recreational sport program for low-income minority girls in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Applying Giddens's theory of structuration to emergent themes from participant observations and interviews, the findings illustrate how structures, as they are embodied through the everyday interactions of their participants, simultaneously constrain certain forms of agency while enabling other forms. This study advances sociology's disciplinary understanding of social construction by illustrating how social structure and cultural discourses interact in shaping everyday social interactions."
0,"This paper addresses the problem of rising Black/White disparities in imprisonment. Annual state imprisonment rates for 1983-1999 are calculated from the Correctional Populations of the United States (CPUS) and National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) data.  Dependent variables are the Black and White rates of being ""in-prison"" (CPUS) and of sentences to prison, disaggregated by offense group.  Multivariate pooled time-series analysis using panel-corrected standard errors is employed to identify the correlates of Black and White imprisonment rates with and without a control for the lagged dependent variable and, for Blacks, with and without a control for the White imprisonment rate.  The most consistent predictor of the level and growth in Black imprisonment is the Black/White poverty ratio, not the absolute level of Black poverty (which is negatively related).  Percent Black in the state's population is negatively related to the level of a state's Black imprisonment, but has weak effects on growth in Black imprisonment.  Crime rates have illogical and inconsistent effects.  Imprisonment is discussed as a political phenomenon that integrates economic and racial dynamics."
0,"As its most basic, this paper argues that the work of Antonio Negri and other contemporary Marxist philosophers who draw from the work of Spinoza, hold great theoretical import not only for Marxist sociology, but also for re-conceiving sociology's role, scope and function during the public university's imminent corporatization in the era of a post-Fordist economy.  Using the past 40th anniversary of George C. Homans as inspiration, this paper celebrates Homans' spirit of critique, yet ultimately find the romance of a humanistic subject as the locus of political agency and change unsatisfying as the traditional, rather convenient, dichotomies between civil society/market, citizen/consumer, person/collectivity, and the one Spinoza tells us to discontinue, mind/body, no longer hold.  Of course, this rejection of the mind/body dichotomy completely undermine Homans notion of man, but still locates blood in the materialist potential (and only potential) of the multitudes.  It is precisely this under-explored theme of temporality in sociology that I believe holds so much potential for revitalizing Marxist sociology today. This paper concludes by reviewing current literature in the field, from the sociology of emotions, economic sociology, and the growing sociology of networks, to argue that much of that research buttresses the argument that the concept of multitudes, although not an analytic concept, is still a useful sociological, and not merely ontological, concept."
0,"Over the last two decades, the way doctors and patients interact has changed. There has been a shift away from what Talcott Parsons described as a paternalistic model of interaction to a more collaborative, participatory, patient-centered model of interaction. Yet not all interactions between doctors and patients are collaborative. Using status characteristics theory, the authors hypothesized that medical encounters are more likely to be physician dominated when the status differences between doctors and patients are higher. They tested hypotheses about race, gender, and socioeconomic status differences between doctors and patients. The authors found support for the hypotheses, especially regarding status differences for race and gender. Doctor-patient interactions were most physician-centered when doctors had higher status than patients on race (white versus non-white) and gender (male versus female)."
0,"This article uses the concept of habitus to address the puzzle of past-in-present racial formations. Although formal ideologies of white supremacy may be suddenly overturned, the embodied dispositions of the habitus should prove durable and may even improvise new practices that transpose old racial schemata into new settings. Evidence for these propositions derives from an ethnography of marketing practices inside a leisure firm in post-apartheid South Africa. In the organizational backstage, veteran white managers routinely categorize consumers as desired ""whities"" versus denigrated ""darkies."" But a second discourse of marketing, found in the frontstage, uses survey data to divide the market into ""blue-collar"" and ""jazz"" types. By structuring marketing strategy to attract the former and repel the latter, managers exclude black consumers and euphemize such exclusion vis-a-vis the state and other public audiences. Findings extend not only racial formation theory, but also U.S.-based understandings of discrimination."
0,"To what extent did the increase in wage inequality among men in the United States over the past three decades result from job loss and/or employment instability We propose a simple method for decomposing the change in wage inequality into components due to upward and downward between-employer mobility and within-employer wage changes using data on men's wages and job mobility from the 1977-2005 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics We find that downward employer mobility a proxy for job displacement based on movement to a lower paid job with a new employer has the largest effect on inequality over a two-year period. However, the effect of job displacement declines with time. We find that the effect of job loss accounts for 39 percent of the increase in wage inequality during the average eight-year period from 1977 through 2005, compared to 52 percent that is attributable to wage changes for workers who stay with the same employer."
0,"Literature examining political framing generally focuses on the way that shared framing leads to cohesive actions and policy outcomes. Using a case study of San Francisco's homeless policy field, this article shows that shared framings among the majority of actors in the policy field did not lead to cooperative alliance among those actors nor to coherent policy based on their shared framing. To understand why shared framing failed, I examine the complex interaction between frames, influence, and material resources. While the center and the left of the policy field shared common diagnostic framings and solution-oriented prognostic framings of homelessness, the right possessed far superior material resources and political influence compared to the left. The center and left divided over different tactical prognostic framings about how to politically relate to the resources and influence of the right. These internal dynamics of the field were further amplified by the field's local institutional and national policy-making contexts. This article adds to understandings of how to map political fields, how ideas shape policy outcomes, and how meaning and materiality interact in the process of politics. Keywords: framing, policy, fields, networks, homelessness."
0,"This article is a qualitative examination of the impact of consumerism on pedagogical relationships and, in turn, its subsequent significance for standards of excellence in higher education. Based on seventy-five in-depth interviews, students' ratings of faculty are found to be normative assessments of a professor's conformity with students' pedagogical role expectations that have been derived from a market ideology and framed by a transmission model of education embedded in the rating form. When transformed into numbers, student ratings become misconstrued as quantified measures of teaching excellence that institutionally serve to provide an illusion of objectivity and penalize faculty who adhere to an alternative critical model of pedagogy. Through the use of rating forms, academic control and professional authority are transferred from faculty to students, who, as discriminating consumers, are granted the power to further their own interests and, consequently, shape the nature and form of higher education that serves them."
0,"In the last few decades school violence has been a widely researched and discussed topic.  Similarly, fear of crime has also received a lot of attention.  The consequences of these serious social problems for adolescents, particularly the latter, however, have been largely overlooked.  This study focuses specifically on adolescent fear of crime, avoidance as a coping mechanism, and the affects on academic success through secondary data analysis of the 2003 National Crime Victimization Surveys School Crime Supplement.  Based on stress process theory, it is hypothesized that students in fear are more likely to both display avoidance behaviors and have greater academic difficulty compared to those not in fear.  It is also hypothesized that avoidance mediates the relationship between fear and academic difficulty.  Regression results generally supported the hypotheses.  Students in fear are, in fact, more likely to display avoidance behaviors and to experience academic difficulty.  Avoidance, however, only partially mediates the relationship between fear and academic difficulty.  Overall, the results suggest that adolescent fear of crime has serious consequences that need to be examined further."
0,"Self-efficacy is a social psychological construct that is conceptualized from an agentic perspective and refers to the motivation to perceive oneself as a causal agent.  A recent work place intervention within a division of a large Australian retail organization was designed to empower workers through the 4 sources of self-efficacy information: enactive attainment, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion and emotional arousal.   This information was delivered via a Forum Theatre setting, a technique traditionally used as a catalyst for political action amongst oppressed groups.  Preliminary results suggest the interventions format has lead to an increase in employee self-efficacy, empowerment and engagement as well as improved organizational performance.  This paper describes the theoretical nexus between self-efficacy, work motivation and employee engagement and outlines a research program utilizing Forum Theatre as a vehicle to shift power to workers while concurrently meeting organizational objectives.  The use of Forum Theatre suggests that another world is indeed possible for disengaged and alienated workers, a world where they are empowered."
0,"We use nationally representative data to examine immigrant children’s risk for special education placement with a learning disability (LD) over the elementary and middle school years. We find that children of immigrant parents are less likely than third-plus generation children to be diagnosed with LD and placed in special education during the first years of schooling, but significantly more likely to be placed in special education in the later grades. This temporal pattern is explained by immigrant children’s high levels of participation in English as a second language (ESL) programs in kindergarten and first grade. ESL service receipt strongly reduces children’s odds of participating in special education during the early grades, though ESL recipients are overrepresented in special education in later years. Implications for special education’s equity and effectiveness are discussed."
0,"When North American slavery was established in the 1600s, an interpretive perspective was developed that sought to justify the institution of African American slavery. This composite perspective, a ""white racial frame,"" was later extended by whites to other racial groups such as Latinos/as. This racial frame, which has become white ""common sense,"" includes important racial stereotypes, understandings, images, and inclinations to act. Various forms of this racial framing exist among different U.S. racial groups, but a strong white racial frame has prevailed because whites have long had the power and the resources to impose this reality. A hegemonic situation occurs when people of color consent in various ways to this white racial framing and common sense. This acceptance varies. We discuss four forms of consent to white racial framing that appear in our in-depth interviews in a national sample of Latinos/as. Three forms reference Latinos: acceptance of elements of the racial frame, active enactment of the racial frame, and internalized violence. The fourth use of racial framing is directed by Latinos at African Americans."
0,"The division of labor is one of the most pervasive and defining social forces in modern society yet it is largely taken-for-granted.  In sociology, the division of knowledge power  that is, who defines, produces and consumes what knowledge where and how  is routinely assumed more than problematized.  This paper argues for a public sociology which works for a more democratic division of knowledge power, and particularly for bridging the yawning gap that exists between sociologists and larger, uninterested publics.  The paper ends with proposals to build a more public sociology, including, among other things, reform in tenure requirements and graduate training, and the development of visual sociology, deliberative democracy, and a popular magazine Sociology Today."
0,"This study examines the impact of age, period, and birth cohorts on two types of voting behavior: voter turnout and vote choice in U.S. presidential elections.  Using data from the 1952-2004 National Election Study surveys and utilizing random effects hierarchical age, period, and cohort models, I provide better estimates of how these three factors affect voting behavior than in subsequent studies.  The results show that age, period, and birth cohorts have significant effects on voting behavior.  However, the effect of birth cohorts on voter turnout is only marginally significant.  Cohorts from the 19th Century through the early 1920s tend to vote in presidential elections.  This tendency decreases dramatically after the 1925-1929 cohort.  Subsequent cohorts tend not to vote in presidential elections until the 1970s and 1980s when the trend reverses itself.  Support for Republicans is high among cohorts born before 1900.  After 1900, there is a strong tendency among cohorts to vote for Democratic candidates.  This trend continues unabated (except for the 1935-1939 cohort) until 1954.  Starting with the 1955-1959 cohort, the trend line indicates continuous support for Republican candidates until a temporary shift in support for Democratic candidates with the 1975-1979 cohort.  Age increases the probability of voting until age 63, and afterwards the probability of voting decreases.  Also, as one ages the likelihood of voting for a Democratic presidential candidate decreases.  Given the significant effect of age on voting behavior, I argue that age should be viewed as a social cleavage."
0,"Social exclusion is considered one of the biggest problems facing those with mental health problems. It places mental health sufferers into a position of social conflict with the rest of ‘healthy’ society and its norms. In this context, individualisation and subjectivisation of religiosity mirrors wider social processes of the changing place and role of religion in modern society. This paper examines the relationship between religion and mental illness in the secularising Irish context. It is claimed that neo-secularisation theory helps to understand not only the declining influence of religion, religious communities, and religious organisations but also the changing position, influence and role of the religious authority structures. It is argued that the non-denominational peer-led, voluntary group GROW acts as an alternative (religious) authority system in the context of mental health support. The study was conducted throughout the months of October 2007 till March 2008 where ten interviews were completed, twelve GROW meetings were observed and the main GROW text was examined. For the purposes of this paper, findings from the semi-structured in-depth interviews will be discussed. Our findings suggest that the effects of neo-secularisation processes have contributed to the relocation of authority structures from religious to seemingly non-religious venues and thereby have been able to reinforce social inclusion and minimise the effects of social conflict with ‘healthy’ society."
0,"Testing the notion that global economic forces are pervasive in their effects on individual industrial sectors, I examine whether or not the case holds for one metropolitan areas funeral homes. This qualitative research program supports the conclusion that funeral directors and mortuary school students are all affected by the industry-wide shifts that have taken place in the need to sustain revenues and that these changes are indeed embedded in global factors. Respondents suggest that branding, niche marketing, subcontracting, and new forms of vertical integration are ubiquitous and predict a transformation of the funeral industry. In the first third of this paper I provide some background into some of the macro-structural economic trends that are shaping the funeral industry. In the final two-thirds, interview data attest to the evolving roles funeral professionals play in a market that is broadening its service options while simultaneously increasing its occupational-role specialization. Work in the funeral industry is becoming increasingly rationalized which sets the present generation of workers apart from their predecessors. The resulting strain for economic actors in the funeral trade has implications for both the way death is celebrated and the body is ritualized."
0,"In this study we bring together two sociological traditions: experimental research on how different forms of exchange affect attachments to partners and relationships, and organizational research in natural settings on how embeddedness contributes to social capital. We conceptualize embeddedness in terms of the underlying forms of exchange-negotiated and reciprocal-that are associated with economic exchanges and the social relationships in which they are embedded. Building upon the reciprocity theory of social exchange, we test predictions of how relationship histories (i.e., different sequences of the two forms of exchange) and relationship contexts (i.e., embedding one form of exchange within an ongoing relation of the other form) modify effects of each form in isolation. Results from two experiments show that the reciprocal form of exchange, independent of close ties or personal associations, is critical for producing the strong trust and affective bonds typically associated with embedded relationships. A history or context of reciprocal exchange significantly boosts integrative bonds for negotiated exchange, whereas a history or context of negotiated exchange dampens integrative bonds for reciprocal exchange only moderately. The relative effects of history and context vary by actors' positions of power."
0,"Men and women engage with reproductive technologies in various roles: as physicians and patients, spouses and partners, donors and recipients. Yet, one particular role and relationship – the gamete donor’s spouse -- has been consistently overlooked. In this chapter, I turn the focus on how a donor’s spouse may be involved in gamete donation in the United States. Some countries explicitly involve a donor’s spouse by legally requiring their consent to the donation (e.g., France and Australia) (Pennings 1996; Robertson 1988), but this is not the case for the U.S. In the absence of formal regulation, what are the informal expectations for spousal involvement? Do these differ for egg and sperm donation? Conducting a content analysis of donation program materials, I found more frequent, explicit expectations for spousal involvement in egg donation and egg donor’s spouses and partners were also expected to be involved in ways that were not evident for sperm donation: to participate in medical or psychological screening; to verify the donor application; and to act as a party in agreements between the donor and the program and the donor and recipient(s). While these informal practices may be professionally justified in terms of procedural risks and the relative legal uncertainty of egg donation, they also create double standards for egg and sperm donors, which other scholars have also observed (Haimes 1993; Braverman 1993; Almeling 2007). Furthermore, I argue that they contribute to existing controversies about navigating boundaries between intimate relationships and women’s medical and reproductive autonomy."
0,"Young American workers typically change employers many times in the course of establishing their careers. This article examines the consequences of this mobility for wage inequalities between and among men and women. Using multilevel modeling and data from the 1979 to 2002 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), I disentangle the various ways in which mobility shapes the trajectories of wage growth. Findings caution against accepting the adequacy of prevalent economic models of mobility-models that tend to isolate individual workers' moves from broader patterns of work history and that treat mobility as a decontextualized individual choice. Although workers who frequently switch employers generally end up earning less than their more-stable counterparts, the type, timing, and relative level of changes strongly affect the ultimate wage differential. Differences in the degree,of men and women labor-force attachment and family circumstances are also influential. Workers who are less attached to the labor force benefit less from changing employers, and women who are married or have children also tend to experience less-favorable mobility-wage outcomes."
0,"In this paper, we examine how unmarried parents past fertility is associated with their relationship stability from pregnancy to approximately 2 ½ years after the childs birth.  We hypothesize that multiple partner fertility (MPF) predicts relationship instability and that single partner fertility predicts stability, net of other factors.  We use data from a prospective, longitudinal study of inner-city, low-income women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania among whom multiple partner fertility is common.  We use multinomial logit regression to examine the associations between multiple partner fertility and single partner fertility with relationship stability.  We find a negative association between womens cohabitation or marriage to men with children from multiple partners, taking demographic and socioeconomic characteristics into account.  We found the same negative association for mothers multiple partner fertility with cohabitation and marriage with the father of the focal child, although this relationship was not statistically significant when we adjusted for maternal and paternal characteristics.  Consistent with much (but not all) of the prior literature, MPF  particularly male MPF  may inhibit union formation."
0,"Based on both archival research and two and a half years of ethnographic fieldwork in an Argentine shantytown with high levels of air water and ground contamination, this article examines the social production of environmental uncertainty. First, we dissect residents' perceptions of contamination, finding widespread doubts and mistakes about the polluted habitat. Second, we provide a sociologically informed account of uncertainty and the erroneous perceptions that underlie it. Along with inherent ambiguity surrounding toxic contamination, the generalized confusion about sources and effects of pollution is the result of two factors: (1) the ""relational anchoring"" of risk perceptions and (2) the ""labor of confusion"" generated by powerful outside actors. We derive two implications from this ethnographic case study: (1) Cognitive psychology and organizational sociology can travel beyond the boundaries of self-bounded communities and laboratory settings to understand and explain the collective production and reproduction of ignorance, uncertainty, and error (2) Research on inequality and marginality in general, and in Latin America in particular should pay close attention to the contaminated spaces where the urban poor live."
0,"We examine victims' dissatisfaction with the police and the courts as a function of their gender, their relationship to the offender, and whether they were physically or sexually assaulted. Analyses of the National Violence Against Women (and Men) Survey reveal that victims are more dissatisfied with the police when the offender is someone they know than when the offender is a stranger, regardless of gender and regardless of whether the offender is a family member or intimate partner. Victims who know the offender are more likely to complain that the police were too lenient and that the police did not believe them. Victims of sexual assault are more likely than victims of physical assault to be dissatisfied with the police and the courts. They complain more about police insensitivity, but they are not more likely to complain about leniency, skepticism, of their charges or not being taken seriously. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"The landmark 1996 reform to Aid with Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) provides an opportunity to study processes of welfare reform in the United States.  A potential factor behind the transformation of AFDC is public opinion, possibly in the form of changes in attitudes among politically relevant groups.  This study will evaluate this thesis, focusing on attitudinal changes between partisan identifiers.  Most data suggests the American public may have been critical of welfare programs prior to the 1996 reform.  However, the extent of these criticisms generally varies depending on who is asked, how questions are worded and the type of program.  Using GSS data, I analyze trends in public opinion among political identifiers and evaluate the process through which the 1996 reform was enacted."
0,"Although prior work has demonstrated that economic actors who fail to conform to prevailing logics—such as the categorical structure of markets—garner less attention and perform poorly, evidence also suggests that some non-conforming actors can elicit considerable attention and thrive. In this paper, I propose a new model for better understanding when conformity and non-conformity have favorable effects on certain economic outcomes. Analyzing the association between organizational conformity, returns, and capital flows in the context of the hedge fund industry, I find that investors allocate capital more readily into non-conforming hedge funds following periods of short-term positive performance. Non-conforming funds are also less severely penalized for recent poor performance. Both effects persist despite strong steady-state normative pressures towards conformity. Deciphering this outcome and exploring what it means for theories relating to organizational identity, legitimacy, and isomorphism in markets, are the aims of this paper. Legitimacy-seeking processes are ultimately reinterpreted probabilistically according to the following simple intuition: whereas winning alone is rewarded, losing in a pack is penalized."
0,"Previous research argues that political brokers between rival factions play a critical role in state centralization because they help national state builders to undermine local autonomy. In contrast, this article demonstrates how coordinator elites who forge relationships within communal networks act as a counterweight to more cosmopolitan brokers, representing local interests. Evidence from new archival data on credit networks and political mobilization in Revolutionary Vermont shows that such local powerholders used their strategic position in economic networks to gain influential political offices. Moreover, coordinators strengthened local political factions that linked to national politics without eroding the interests of local communities."
0,"Findings of home-country ties abound in the international migration literature, and many scholars herald a new form of immigrant adaption that is broadly described as ""transnational."" In contrast, recent work shows that these ties are surprisingly short lived and often superficial in nature. To assess the durability and strength of transnational attachments, using evidence that can improve on the shortcomings of previous work, this paper draws on the public use data set produced by the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey. Remittances, travel, and emotional as well as political ties to sending and recieving states are examined and are found to vary strongly by generation and linguistic capability."
0,"This paper traces key features of recent state reorganization by examining the discourse of personal responsibility permeating the American welfare and penal systems.  Existing accounts of the state focus primarily on changes in state regulation of labor markets in identifying features of neoliberal governance in the reorganization of the state.  Though feminist scholars have shown that independence has long been a goal of state policy, we argue this has been conceptualized as participation in the labor market.  In contrast, our discursive analysis of the language of personal responsibility suggests that participation in nuclear family units underpins the ability of poor women to meet the expectations of the state. Thus the family is increasingly being viewed by state actors as a means through which poor women can attain personal responsibility.  As personal responsibility has come to replace the rehabilitative ideal, therapeutic strategies have been reframed in terms of personal culpability and transformation. This has been accomplished through the devolution of state activities to non-state actors such as non-profit organizations, and especially faith-based organizations.  Changes in the both the agents and means of governance have produced an institutional framework within which the discourse linking family to personal responsibility is strengthened."
0,"Bridging the areas of political-economic sociology, the sociology of agriculture, and environmental sociology, this study tests two hypotheses derived from a refined theory of foreign investment dependence.  The hypotheses state that foreign investment dependence in the primary sector is positively associated with pesticide and fertilizer use intensity in less-developed countries.  The use of both inputs in agriculture production is known to contribute to a variety of human health and environmental problems.  Findings for random effects panel regression analyses of 36 less-developed countries confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the transnational organization and the relative scale of production in different sectors."
0,"This study uses an affect theory of social exchange (Lawler 2001) to investigate how and when network structures generate ""micro social orders."" Micro social order entails recurrent interactions, emotional reactions, perceptions of a group, and affective sentiments. The core theoretical argument is that micro orders, involving behavioral, cognitive, and affective dimensions, develop and are stronger to the degree that (1) actors engage in highly joint tasks or activities and (2) these tasks generate a sense of shared responsibility for the interaction outcomes. A laboratory experiment varies different forms of social exchange-negotiated, reciprocal, generalized, and productive within a network structure, and offers strong support for the core expectation that productive forms of exchange generate the strongest micro order Conversely, generalized exchange generates the weakest order with negotiated and reciprocal forms in between. In general, productive exchange bolsters more exchange behavior more positive feelings, perceptions of cohesion at the network level, and affective attachments to the network as a social unit. This research has broad implications for the conditions under which task activity promotes micro social orders that involve strong person-to-group ties (as opposed to person-to-person ties) and affective sentiments regarding the social unit."
0,"Within the paradigm of tourist studies there has recently been an acceptance of the democratization of tourism and consumption. Missing from the notion of the democratization of tourism is the role of status building through the creation of cultural capital enhancing experiences. While tourist spaces may be becoming democratized, the relationships between tourists within those spaces are not. Increasingly tourists are relying on the performance and presence of other tourists who have similar interests and motives, what we call the role of the co-tourist, to facilitate the tourist experience. This paper addresses the importance of recognizing status and consumption for the study of tourism, posits the notion of a co-tourist, and ends with some reflections on the co-tourist in Santa Barbara, California."
0,"This article examines employers' perceptions, attitudes, and preferences regarding native black and immigrant Latina/o workers in the Los Angeles hotel industry. We find that the employers in this industry almost universally prefer immigrant Latina/o workers over native blacks for entry-level, hotel maid jobs. Moreover, we find that employers stress soft skills (attitude, work ethic, interaction skills) to frame their hiring decisions for entry-level jobs when in fact these preferences appear to speak more to tractability. Thus, we caution researchers about the coded meanings of the soft skills concept and about uncritically classifying employer talk about attitudes, motivation, and work ethic as indicators of soft skills when these preferences appear to speak more to immigrant Latina/o vulnerabilities in shaping employer hiring decisions. Keywords: race, soft skills, immigrant Latino and native black workers, employer discrimination, hotel industry."
0,"The nation-state ideal of a homogenous population was made possible by the social scientific work of ethnic categorization. A case study of the nomadic “Lapps” (today’s Sámi) shows how Swedish scientists defined the nation in territorial and ethnic terms that shifted according to geopolitical status, successfully developing internationally-adopted scientific techniques and concepts. This case reveals the reflexive process by which a) the content of ethnoracial population categories reflects contemporary geopolitical priorities of nation-states, b) shifts in these political priorities spark methodological innovations to redefine the population category, leading to c) the durability of population categories despite paradigm shifts within social science, a key arena in the co-production of state and society."
0,"In this study we focus on the relationship between ethnic diversity and informal social capital. As this refers to rather strong social ties in the intimate domain, it is a strict test of Putnam's claim that ethnic diversity would decrease social capital. In order to explain these relationships, we derived mediating mechanisms from conflict and contact theory. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002/2003), we applied multilevel analyses considering three levels: individuals, regions and countries. Our results revealed a direct positive effect of ethnic diversity at the country level on informal helping, yet no indirect effect via the mediating variables. At the regional level, we only found an indirect effect of ethnic diversity. Here, ethnic diversity increases the likelihood of intergroup contact that in turn is positively related to both informal social meeting and helping. Perceived ethnic threat turned out to have a negative effect on informal social meeting. "
0,"This article examines national identification from a comparative and multilevel perspective. Building on the identity, nationalism, and prejudice literatures, I analyze relationships between societies' economic, political, and cultural characteristics (e.g., development, globalization, democratic governance, militarism, and religious and linguistic diversity), individual characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status and minority status), and preferences for the content of national identities. I also examine relationships between national identity content and public policy preferences toward immigration, citizenship, assimilation, and foreign policy, generally. I use confirmatory factor analysis and multilevel modeling to analyze country-level data and survey data from 31 countries (from the International Social Survey Program 2003 National Identity II Module). Results suggest that individual and country characteristics help account for the variable and contested nature of national identification. Moreover the content of national identity categories has implications for public policy and intergroup relations."
0,"This article uses extensive ethnographic data on the U. S. white power movement ( WPM) to describe the interactional aspects of managing activist stigma in everyday settings. We describe their stigma management as a form of everyday resistance. In the face of strong cultural codes against extreme racism, they conceal their Aryan identity to avoid the constant ire, indignation, and conflict they face from others. But, concealing their activist identity creates dissonance, which they work out by exploiting opportunities to selectively disclose features of their racist self. Disclosing aspects of their Aryan self while covering the more extreme aspects creates some expressive balance, which activists experience as resistance to social constraints on identity and self-expression that they perceive. We explain variances in the degree to which WPM members conceal and disclose their identity by focusing on structural differences in the common, everyday settings of family, work, school, and other public contexts."
0,"Social scientists generally seek to explain welfare-related behaviors in terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories. Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that, compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy implications-implications we outline in our conclusion."
0,"This paper extends work on corporate philanthropy by arguing that we need to look not only at legal and institutional factors that shape corporate philanthropic activity but also at the ecology of the ""consuming"" organizations toward which philanthropic activity is directed. We examine the forces that shape the philanthropic practices of corporations, focusing our analysis on corporate giving to local schools. The analysis draws upon a survey of the philanthropic practices of a representative sample of 2776 corporations in the United States in 2002. Two significant findings emerge: first, higher levels of state corporate taxation are associated with greater levels of giving to local schools. This finding fits well with established arguments about the relationship between tax write-offs and charitable giving-higher taxes provide greater incentives for increasing philanthropic activity. Second the proportion of private schools in a given state is inversely related to philanthropic giving to local schools. We argue that the ecology of the receiving organizations in this area shape the perceptions of need among corporate givers. Corporations that are in states that have more competition between schools and a healthier ""market"" for education demonstrate less commitment supporting the provision of social services in this area.

0,"Protest policing scholars have theorized a general decline in more coercive police tactics since the 1960s. Unfortunately, few studies directly examine the evolution of protest control to gauge the empirical support for this pattern. To address this gap in the literature, we use semiparametric logistic regression analysis to examine patterns in police presence, the use of arrests, and the use of force at over 15,000 protests covered by the New York Times between 1960 and 1995. Using a nonparametric operationalization of time, we systematically assess how protest policing has changed, and whether the trends we observe are similar across each of the tactics we examine. While our results confirm that there has been an absolute decline in more heavy-handed policing, there are different evolutionary logics for each police tactic we investigate. In addition, our results raise the possibility that an overall decrease in more coercive protest control may simply be a function of lower levels of police presence at protest events, and not necessarily due to the development of a more amicable protest management strategy."
0,"We use data from the 2006 American Community Survey to examine race and ethnic differences in the effects of marital status and co-residence of the middle generation on the likelihood of poverty among grandfathers who have primary responsibility for co-resident grandchildren (N = 3,379). Logistic regression results indicate that race/ethnicity and household composition are significant predictors of poverty for grandfather caregivers: non-Hispanic white grandfathers, those who are married, and those with a co-resident middle generation are the least likely to be poor. The effects of race/ethnicity, marital status, and the presence of a middle generation are, however, contingent upon one another. Specifically, the negative effect of being married is lower among grandfathers who are Hispanic, African American, non-Hispanic, and non-Hispanics of other race/ethnic groups compared to whites. In addition, having a middle generation in the home has a larger negative effect on poverty for race/ethnic minority grandfathers than for non-Hispanic whites. Finally, the combined effects of marriage and a middle generation vary across race/ethnic group and are associated with lower chances of poverty among some groups compared with others. We use the theory of cumulative disadvantage to interpret these findings and suggest that race/ethnicity and household composition are synergistically related to economic resources for grandfather caregivers."
0,"Using longitudinal data from 769 white adolescents in the Midwest, this research applies a social structure and personality perspective to examine variation in self-esteem and mastery trajectories by gender and SES across the high school years. Analyses reveal that high SES adolescents experience significantly steeper gains in self-esteem and mastery compared to low SES adolescents, resulting in the reversal of SES differences in self-esteem and the emergence of significant SES differences in mastery. Pre-existing gender differences in self-esteem narrow between the 9th and 12th grade because self-esteem increases at a faster rate among girls than boys during high school. These SES and gender differences in self-concept growth are explained by changes in parent-adolescent relationship quality and stress exposure. Specifically, boys and adolescents with lower SES backgrounds experienced steeper declines in parent-adolescent relationship quality and steeper gains in chronic work strain compared to girls and low SES adolescents, respectively.

0,"An important aspect of postindustrial cities has been the development of large nighttime economies as downtown regeneration strategies.  With this has come a shift in how urban nighttime spaces are regulated.  This paper uses the case of the Lower East Side of Manhattans nightscape to examine this shift in nightlife regulation.  The nightscape first developed through a deregulation of liquor licensing that permitted a dense concentration of bars resulting in economic growth for as well as negative quality of life conditions within the area such as noise and litter.  Rather than deal with these disorderly conditions as other forms of broken-windows-style urban regulation do, the new flexible nightlife regulation permits and effectively co-opts them as integral aspects of nightscapes and contemporary urban culture.  In this paper I examine how the Lower East Sides nightscape was constructed through deregulation and how its current conditions are shaped by flexible regulation.  The new nightlife regulation serves as a window for understanding the complex ways in which cities construct nightscapes and provides a new insight into the regulation of public space."
0,"The authors describe a common but largely unrecognized mechanism that produces and exacerbates intergroup inequality: the diffusion of valuable practices with positive network externalities through social networks whose members differentially possess characteristics associated with adoption. The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages."
0,"Even though serial cohabitation is on the rise, it has not been integrated into recent family research. We analyze the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) cycle 6 to explore the relationship context of serial cohabitation for women throughout emerging adulthood (N = 3397). We provide a relationship context for serial cohabitation by examining the age at first cohabitation, duration of cohabiting unions, marital expectations and transitions, as well as premarital sexual histories. Furthermore, we examine the change in these relationship indicators across women's birth cohorts. We find that serial cohabitors' co-residential unions are about the same duration as single-instance cohabiting unions. Serial cohabitors start cohabiting younger, report lower marital expectations than single-instance cohabitors and a smaller proportion marry before age 30. Women who have more premarital sex partners have significantly greater odds of serial cohabiting. These findings indicate that women face increasingly complex relationship trajectories during emerging adulthood. "
0,"This article examines how social constraint affects the rate of reciprocal exchange among actors in a network.  Using panel data on venture capital (VC) firms joint investments in start-ups from 1975 through 2001, we develop and test claims related to the hazard that a lead VC (A) after bringing a follower VC (B) into its syndicate, is subsequently granted membership in a syndicate headed by the follower.  Our hypotheses are twofold: After A has given to B, As constraint of B raises the rate at which B reciprocates; and the effect of As constraint of B drops with turnover in their shared network of contacts.  We test these hypotheses by modeling the hazard that B invites A to co-invest in a start-up, after A has done so for B.  We find that the probability that B returns an investment opportunity to A rises with the extent to which A constrains B in the network of co-investments. Underpinning our conception of constraint is the earlier work of Burt (1992), and related research on tie strength: A constrains B insofar as B has relatively strong connections to third parties who in turn have relatively strong connections to A, thus amplifying the costs of Bs failure to give back.  Consistent with Colemans (1990) work on the destruction of social capital, we also find that temporal stability in the network preserves constraints effect (and thus As social capital with respect to B), or equivalently, that constraint ceases to matter in turbulent networks."
0,"Many believe that black under-achievement results from a burden of acting white. Although previous research attempts to establish this burden, these studies confound adolescents opportunities for friendship with their friendship choices. In this paper, I model adolescents friendship group choices. Using data from Add Health and discrete-choice analysis, I estimate the effect of racial and academic friendship group composition on individuals probabilities of choosing friendship groups. I further show how individuals race and academic achievement interact with friendship group characteristics to affect their friendship choices. I find that high and non-high-achieving blacks have similarly high probabilities of choosing friendship groups with a majority of black students, and that high-achieving black students prefer high-achieving friendship groups while non-high-achieving blacks are equally likely to choose high- and low-high-achieving friendship groups. These results support the conclusion that high-achieving black students are rejecting their non-high-achieving black peers, rather than the other way around as the acting white hypothesis suggests."
0,"Building on the work of Pierre Bourdieu, we look at the question of whether extracurricular activities at the undergraduate level have an impact on American medical students' habitus, which we operationalize as a sense of inclusion, belonging. Using a national sample of 375 medical students and controlling for relevant variables, we find that for students from high-prestige backgrounds, being white is the major influence on sense of belonging. For students from low-prestige backgrounds, being white, multiple school acceptances, and participation in cultural activities as undergraduates are directly related to sense of belonging. The effect of participation in undergraduate cultural activities on sense of belonging illustrates the hysteresis effect. We discuss the consequences of cultural omnivorousness with its implications for a broad symbolic touch including the ability to decode a wide range of cultural texts in physician-patient communication in the context of a diverse population."
0,"To what extent do household structures vary with ethnicity of the householder? In the last two decades there has been considerable interest in the rising number of families in which children are cared for by their grandparents. Much of the past research assumes that such household structures are atypical. I propose that cultural differences in household formation explain some of the variance in intergenerational household structures in the United States. This study reports findings from the American Community Survey on the role of ethnicity in intergenerational family formation. In particular, I model the probability that a child lives under a particular household structure. I find that ethnicity and English speaking ability are important factors in forming intergenerational household structures. My findings suggest that increased ethnic diversity, possibly through immigration, contributes to the diversity in household and family structures in the United States."
0,"Explaining the drivers of human stress on the environment is a major challenge for environmental sociology.  Treadmill of Production and Ecological Modernization theories have emerged as the major contending explanations.  Shwom has proposed that either explanation may be correct; which depends on political conditions.  We use her argument to develop a structural human ecology model for greenhouse gas emissions by U.S. states in which the effects of scale (population and affluence) on emissions may be moderated but the propensity to do so depends on political ideology and the power of economic elites.  Using panel analysis, we find that neither citizen nor state government political ideology have an effect on emissions, but that when economic elites are more powerful, emissions tend to be larger, ceteris paribus, then when they are less powerful."
0,"This study applies latent trajectory methods to the analysis of temporal changes in homicide rates among large US cities across recent decades Specifically annual homicide rates for 157 large US cities are analyzed for the 30 years from 1976 to 2005 We address the fundamental questions Did all of cities experience similar levels and patterns of rise and decline in homicide rates over these three decades? Or is there hidden or unobserved heterogeneity with respect to these temporal patterns thus leading to the identification of more homogeneous groupings of the cities? And if latent homogeneous groupings surface, is membership due to specific structural characteristics found within those cities? Evidence is found for the existence of four latent homicide rate trajectories After identifying and classifying the cities Into these four groups multivariate statistical techniques are used to determine which social and economic characteristics are significant predictors of these distinct homicide trends Criminal justice measures are also included as controls It is found that larger cities located in the South with higher levels of resource depravation/concentrated poverty higher income inequality higher percentages of the adult male population that are divorced, higher unemployment rates higher percentages of youth higher percentages of the population who are Hispanic and higher numbers of police per capita are more likely to be in a higher than a lower homicide trajectory group Higher percentages of the population enrolled in colleges and universities and locations in states with higher incarceration rates are characteristics of cities associated with membership in a lower homicide trajectory group "
0,"Recent research has integrated the vast literatures on status characteristics theory and stigma by examining how particular characteristics shape micro interactions differently. I build upon this research, arguing that stigma and status are independent by introducing the role of moral expectations associated with stigmatized characteristics. To test this theoretical development, I describe an experimental proposal that examines how sexual orientation affects social interaction relate to low educational achievement. Preliminary results show that homosexuality does not reduce performance expectations but does result in social distance, providing some evidence that the consequences of stigma and status for social interaction can exist independently."
0,"This paper is based on a comparison of residential segregation (D) scores for Anglos, Blacks, Latinos and Latino sub-groups at the metropolitan area level.  Results revealed a pattern of increasing Latino/Anglo segregation between 1980-2000.  In contrast, our results show Black/Anglo segregation is decreasing so that the Black/Latino gap was reduced.  The results of the multivariate analysis suggest metropolitan areas with the largest number of Latinos experienced significantly high levels of segregation, as the population size of Latinos was positively related to increases in residential segregation from Anglos.  The results for occupational status show that as the gap in the distribution of professional jobholders with Anglos closes, their residential segregation goes down.   In those metro areas where Latinos are represented in the suburbs at levels approaching those of Anglos segregation appears to decline.  Similarly, as Latino suburbanization rates became closer to that of Anglos, their segregation scores at the metro area declined. As the Latino-Anglo income differential is reduced residential segregation declines.  Similarly, as the number of Latinos with a college degree increases their residential segregation goes down"
0,"The case of University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill involves important freedom of expression issues.  Churchill made inflammatory comments about victims of the 9/11 tragedy in an essay originally published on his website in 2001.  Discovering his essay in early 2005, conservative critics and media pundits have made Churchill into a cause celebre.  At the time of this writing, Churchill, a tenured faculty member, is in danger of losing his job because of a media and political frenzy over his, albeit offensive, speech.  This paper examines how the controversy was built up by the alternative media to be part of the public agenda."
0,"Studying families in post-war London, Elizabeth Bott hypothesized that tight-knit kinship networks fostered gender segregated, rather than joint, conjugal role-relationships for husband and wife. Addressing this hypothesis with 2001 International Social Survey Program for 29 countries, this paper considers one aspect of joint role-relationships - whether married women prefer to turn to their husband, as opposed to kin, for household help and emotional support. Women with tight-knit kin who fill multiple functions in their lives are less likely to prefer to rely on husbands. Residential mobility is associated with greater reliance on the spouse, but there is no indication that the importance of kinship is diminished when mobility is controlled. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

0,"This paper studies the relationships between power, gender, autonomia and disobedience. Gender is considered as the result of the long-term cultural processes of social power networks. We also consider power in terms of action and behavior. From this point of view, power is the ability to influence the actions of others. The will to power is the will to influence collective actions. Disobedience is thought as a form of behavior that causes rejection and punishment in hierarchically organized societies, it is also a culture and an action that can be learned in order to build autonomy to resist inhumanities in everyday social life. The socialization process is the main cultural process that builds genders. This is done in the context of the family as an institution that educates children in the current pattern of norms, values and social rules, including the legitimate place of sexuality and intimate functions in general. We discuss how radical autonomista political organizations try to enact disobedience as a way of creating what we argue is feminist social change. In order to resist well one must reflect about it."
0,"Much of the information and communication technology (ICT) research has centered on ICT use. This paper focuses on increased stress that results from the use of ICTs in one's work environment. It is proposed that one's level of perceived social support may moderate the relationship between ICT-related job stress and work-family spillover. To test this hypothesis, this study employed a snowball sampling method to obtain a sample of 1,381 respondents from across the United States. Results revealed that ICT-related job stress significantly impacts work-family spillover in both directions. Furthermore, perceived social support was found to moderate the relationship between ICT-related job stress and spillover from work to family."
0,"African American patients are much more likely than other race patients to receive healthcare from African American physicians.  Researchers have assumed that patient preferences influence the race of patients healthcare providers, but the strength of preferences and what factors inform them have not been clarified.  In this paper, I assess the extent to which 1) knowledge of historical mistreatment, 2) knowledge of current racial inequities in medical treatment, and 3) personal experiences of discrimination predict preference for same-race healthcare providers.  Using national phone survey data, I find that only 1 in 5 African Americans states a preference for a same-race healthcare provider.  Neither knowledge of historical mistreatment nor knowledge of current racial inequities in medical treatment are related to preferred race of healthcare providers.  In contrast, I find that personal experiences of discrimination in healthcare are associated with a preference for same-race healthcare providers.  The results contradict prevailing beliefs about African Americans preference for black clinicians.  They also contradict expectations about the relationship between group-level injustice and preferences.  The possible explanations for these findings are reviewed."
0,"In this article, the author investigates the innovative survival strategies of two organizations, both of which claim loyalty to parent institutions while simultaneously attempting to undermine those institutions in a larger political arena. The author asks how and why these organizations are able to maintain this precarious position. Findings indicate that the organizations manage to balance institutional insider and outsider status in three main ways: by reinterpreting key institutional texts in ways that support their own beliefs, by claiming to represent the majority of institutional membership, and by distancing themselves from the ""corrupted"" institutional elites. Their institutional loyalty claims help create a niche in a broader social movement and attracts support from external institutional opponents. But their dual identity also puts them at particular risk of being isolated from supportive communities. In general, these organizations shed light on the creative ways organizations can meet (sometimes) conflicting resource and legitimacy needs."
0,"Much research has shown human rights treaties to be ineffective or even counterproductive, often contributing to greater levels of abuse among countries that ratify them. This article reevaluates the effect of four core human rights treaties on a variety of human rights outcomes. Unlike previous studies, it disaggregates treaty membership to examine the effect of relatively ""stronger"" and ""weaker"" commitments. Two-stage regression analyses that control for the endogeneity of treaty membership show that stronger commitments in the form of optional provisions that allow states and individuals to complain about human rights abuses are often associated with improved practices. The article discusses the scholarly and practical implications of these findings."
0,"This article examines the role of culture in the local urban development process through a case study of recent proposals in Davis, California. The author argues that community cultural expectations-of environmental leadership and the preservation of local character-had an important impact on project proposals and the political campaigns that followed, including the ability of an unlikely corporate developer to win public approval from this town with a vocal and usually powerful anti-corporate character. While on the surface the local growth coalition came together as expected in the literature, this study demonstrates that development organizations operate within cultural contexts that are more complex than the existing discourse has accounted for. Factors that the author calls ""cultural sensitivity"" and ""cultural sincerity"" both play a role. As concerns with environmental sustainability and preservation of local character gain prominence in development politics, the insights drawn from these cases are of particular value."
0,"Social research on nationalism is marked by the relative absence of theoretical advances.  The noncumulative nature of the field is to a large extent driven by fundamental disagreement about what is to be explained.  A crucial step to overcome such a lack of knowledge accumulation is thus a self-reflexive methodology that closely aligns conceptualization and measurement.  This paper proposes three major approaches to the conceptualization of nationalismas (1) a set of political behaviors, (2) a collective sentiment, or (3) a form of ideology or discourse.  It is argued that their respective strengths and weaknesses depend on the specific research question asked.  The choice of an analytical perspective, however, has major ramifications for the choice of feasible measures.  The second part of the paper surveys plausible (and less plausible) measurement strategies for these conceptualizations of nationalism."
0,"The degree to which social well-being is predicated upon levels of material consumption remains under-examined from a large-N, quantitative perspective. The present study analyzes the factors influencing levels of maternal mortality in 2005 among 92 peripheral countries. We incorporate into regression analysis the ecological footprint, a comprehensive measure of natural resource consumption, and alternative explanatory variables drawn from previous research. Results illustrate ecological footprint consumption has a moderately strong direct influence shaping lower levels of maternal mortality. Path analysis reveals export commodity concentration has a negative effect on level of ecological footprint demand net the strong positive influence of income per capita. This illustrates cross-national trade dependency relations directly influence natural resource consumption opportunities and thereby indirectly contribute to higher maternal mortality levels within the periphery of the world economy. The results confirm material consumption is an important dimension of improvement in maternal mortality. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"This article explores the plausibility of the conflicting theoretical assumptions underlying the main criminological perspectives on juvenile delinquents, their peer relations and social skills: the social ability model, represented by Sutherland's theory of differential associations, and the social disability model, represented by Hirschi's control theory. It does so by applying the principles associated with Granovetter's theory of strong and weak ties, drawing out its theoretical implications for the criminological theories and deriving a number of hypotheses. The article uses ""strategic research materials"" in the form of a data set strongly biased towards the social disability model and containing information on co-offending relations among a population (N = 580) of juveniles in a Swedish town during a three-year period. Results from cross-sectional empirical analyses using, among other things, the Quadratic Assignment Procedure, clearly support the social ability model. The robustness of the initial analyses is checked through longitudinal analyses applying actor-oriented statistical models for network evolution. The article's implications for criminological, as well as multidisciplinary, research are discussed."
0,"For much of early East Asian history trade was organized by a tributary system that both regulated economic and political relations and made clear the hierarchy of relations in the region.  In Han times, and subsequent historical periods, China employed this system to not only influence states, but also to symbolically re-affirm its hegemony.  Entrance into the regional trading system of East Asia meant that foreign peoples would benefit from the acquisition of trading privileges with China, but it also served to acknowledge the sinocentric order of the regional economy.  By abiding to specific formalities, neighboring states and westerners symbolically demonstrated subservience to China, while attempting to access well-sought out Chinese goods.  This study, borrowing from structural ritualization theory, focuses attention to the ritual process whereby foreigners were allowed to legally participate in the East Asian regional economy during the Han Dynastic period (202 B.C.-A.D.220).  Drawing from the description of ritual in the Chinese Dynastic Histories, we examine the symbolic transformation outsiders, or barbarians, underwent as they were incorporated into and became part of a system where China was the center.  The study reveals that ritual as code of conduct was emphasized during the Han period and was a distinguishing factor employed to separate China from the outside world.  References to foreigners in the Dynastic Histories as barbarians were not linked to assessments of ethnicity or race, but were made as a result of what rulers and learned Chinese evaluated as a lack of civilized behavior in the groups they came into contact with."
0,"This paper examines the role of emotions in social constructions of reality. In this case, the construction is the ontological boundary between humans and non-human animals. Using qualitative interviews, the paper examines young peoples socialization into the doctrine known as dominionism, which justifies the use of animals in the service of human beings. We examine young peoples internalization of dominionism through the 4-H youth livestock program, in which they raise cattle, pigs, goats, and sheep to sell for slaughter. Their socialization involves considerable emotion management acquired through apprenticeship under parents and friends. Although this paper explores young peoples relationships with animals, and particularly with types of animals that have received little scholarly attention, the conclusions have implications for understanding the reproduction of inequalities. The means through which people learn to justify certain treatment for some kinds of animals can shed light on the mechanisms involved in generic processes of inequality."
0,"On college campuses across the nation, a new form of drug use is taking place the non-medical use of psychostimulants, sometimes referred to as the casual misuse of prescription drugs, or pharming.  This article takes an in-depth look at how biomedicine is approached as a tool for performance enhancement in the lives of contemporary college students. At the core of this issue is the question: How is the student body transforming to keep up with the pressures of college life? Drawing on survey and interview data, this article reveals how some students manage the various pressures of college by literally constructing medically-disciplined bodies with the help of psychostimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall. Such students may believe they are literally embodying performance ideals in the college classroom and the social scene, enhancing focus, self-control, and managing time. On the other hand, students may also see psychostimulants as representative of potentially problematic medicalized worlds. These students value the natural body, and express concern about a diagnosis culture in which prescription drugs are easy to find, side-effects are real, and medical enhancement creates heightened social and academic expectations for everyone."
0,"Cross-national research finds that ""shadow education""-educational activities outside of formal schooling tends to confer advantages on already privileged students. Shadow education in the United States, such as test prep for college entrance exams, has received considerably less attention. Drawing on the National Education Longitudinal Study, we analyze the likelihood of participation in, and the implications of, SAT preparation. Social class inequalities in test preparation, particularly costly SAT courses and private tutoring, are notable and have at least moderate consequences for SAT scores and selective college enrollment. We also find racial/ethnic variations in the use of test preparation. We consider the implications of these findings for understanding shadow education, stratification and educational mobility in the United States."
0,"Constructionist theories suggest the national rise in female violence arrests may be policy generated because arrest statistics are produced by violent behavior and changing official responses (e. g., net-widening enforcement policies). Normative theories attribute the rise to female behavior changes (e. g., in response to increased freedoms or hardships). We examine whether any narrowing of the arrest gender gap is borne out across offense types of varying measurement reliability, in victimization data, and across two post-arrest criminal justice stages. Advanced time-series analyses over 1980 through 2003 support the constructionist position. First, all sources show little or no increase in women's rates for the more reliably measured offenses of homicide and robbery, and for rape. Second, the assault gender gap narrows for arrests, but holds stable in victimization data. And, third, the assault gender gap narrows moderately for convictions, but is stable for imprisonment, indicating spill-over effects of more expansive arrest policies. Several factors have produced greater female representation in ""criminal assault"" arrests including (1) proactive policing targeting and formally responding to minor violence and in private contexts, (2) interventionist developmental epistemologies that blur distinctions among violence types and circumstances, (3) the rise of social movements recognizing ""hidden"" victims, (4) law and order political messages stressing greater accountability, and (5) the somewhat greater decline in male compared to female violence in the late 1990s. The problem of women's violence is largely a social construction. Rather than women becoming more violent, changes in the management of violence increasingly mask differences in the violence levels of women and men."
0,"This paper shows the different reaction of Korean labor unions to neo-liberal labor policies, according to their organizational characteristics. The Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) has weakly resisted the changes accompanying economic restructuring. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) has responded, however, with a wide range of aggressive actions. The differences between the two federations are pervasive, from leadership styles to attitudes towards capitalism. Also notable is that local unions share the characteristics of the parent federations, especially regarding strategic capacity. The strategic capacities of the local unions affect how they define success and how they attempt to achieve it. For example, the Korean Health and Medical Workers Union (KHMWU) under the KCTU conducted a 216 day strike to win all of its demands, but it was unsuccessful. The Y Medical Center Trade Union (YMCU) under the FKTU, however, quickly compromised with employers. The analyses of the characteristics of these two local unions show that even though the KHMWU case was not successful in terms of the result of the strike, its everyday activities still illustrate how resourcefulness can compensate for a lack of resources and that part of this resourcefulness comes from the influence of its affiliated federation."
0,"Change in profession-level institutional logics can have powerful effects in transforming organizational fields. Prior research on change in profession-level logic highlights that new logics emerge through theorization. While professions constantly theorize new paradigms for organizing professional work, only some are institutionalized as new profession-level logics. I develop a multi-method case study of the institutionalization of clinical guidelines and quality measures as part of a logic of professional accountability in American medicine to generate theory explaining how theorized paradigms are institutionalized as new profession-level institutional logics. I propose that change in profession-level logics emerges from a recursive relationship between intellectual movements within professions and organizational field-level institutional change. I propose changes in field-level institutional logics alter the resonance of frames used by intellectual movements, while new field-level institutional actors alter the opportunity context faced by intellectual movements. Intellectual movements use frame alignment, mentoring, and conferences as mobilizing mechanisms for building support within the profession and in the broader organizational field. Through their mobilizing mechanisms, they draw new institutional actors into the organizational field. This further alters the opportunity context, facilitating institutionalization of their proposed paradigms as profession-level institutional logics."
0,"Although AIDS is a leading cause of death worldwide, the consequences of the pandemic are remarkably unequally distributed cross-nationally. This unequal global distribution of AIDS deaths should be of interest to sociologists because of the potential role of structural forces in accounting for these disparities. Yet, there has been relatively little sociological research on this topic. Using underutilized cross-national data on AIDS deaths, this study examines the macro-level sources of variation in AIDS death rates across 115 countries. The analysis focuses on secondary school enrollment as a key structural factor in reducing AIDS deaths. After controlling for the prevalence of HIV infection, secondary school enrollment has the second largest and most robust effect on AIDS death rates. Economic development also reduces AIDS death rates, but this effect is mediated by secondary school enrollment. Schooling matters partly because it reduces HIV prevalence, but education still continues to have a significant negative effect on AIDS deaths even after controlling for prevalence. The education effect is robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses. Ultimately, this study underscores the role of structural factors, particularly education, for understanding the AIDS crisis."
0,"An operational definition of Guanxi behavior (a type of Chinese social networking) was developed, and several personality and social psychological variables were tested for their relationship with the Guanxi behaviors (in relation to family, friends, and doing favors) developed from the definition. Correlations computed from self reports of 382 Chinese citizens affirmed the expected relationships, and regressions revealed Family Emotional Support, Gregariousness, Chinese Values, and Face to be positively and significantly related to, and explained 41-55% of the variance for, the Guanxi social-networking behaviors. In addition, the Guanxi behaviors explained significant variance for Coworker Support, Life Satisfaction, and Attribution-to-Self for success in life. Concepts are discussed in relation to Chinese culture, as well as attachment and needs theories. "
0,"In recent years, U.S. retirees are increasingly heading to Latin American countries. Many elderly with low-income are afraid that they will not be able to afford retiring due to the rising living and health care expenses. Little is known about the demographics of the U.S. retirees who retire in a foreign country, and the social and health care issues they face there. A few existing research on U.S. retirees suggest that the major barrier for U.S. retirees to retire in a foreign country is the lack of Medicare coverage. Medicare does not pay for medical care outside of United States. The major objectives of this discussion would be to understand (1) the demographics of the U.S. retirees that are likely to retire in a foreign country; (2) what factors influence their decisions; and (3) understand their experience in the destination country, particularly their health care issues. It is expected that based on the roundtable discussion, important ideas and suggestions will emerge for future research in this topic. It is expected that the proposed discussion will be valuable to those working in the fields on sociology of health and illness, aging, and social demography."
0,"This study informs family and child health research by using longitudinal Fragile Families data to assess how family structure and transitions are associated with changes in children's BMI and weight status between ages three and five. Concerns in family structure literature about biases due to selectivity are reduced through the use of change score models and by controlling for parental BMI. The findings indicate unhealthy BMI gain and an increased risk of becoming overweight/obese among children living with a mother who recently dissolved a union or had been living without a partner for at least 2 years compared with those in stable married parent families. Children with single mothers who entered a new union had significantly healthier BMI trajectories than those whose mothers remained single or recently became single. These results suggest the importance of two-parent family contexts for children's healthy physical development, and that single mothers may need additional support to better manage their children's BMI.

0,"Some immigrants to the United States arrive to find co-ethnic communities that are highly entrepreneurial, and many members of their own group among their prospective employers. Other immigrants settle in far less entrepreneurial communities and have few if any co-ethnics among prospective employers. We assess whether co-ethnic entrepreneurship improves immigrant employees' wages. Previous research has focused on a small number of the largest ethnic groups in the largest cities. We study immigrants in 490 ethnic communities across the United States. Controlling for ethnicity. metropolitan area, and key individual- and community-level characteristics, we find effects of co-ethnic entrepreneurship on immigrant employees' wages that vary substantially with the characteristics of entrepreneurs and employees. Overall, immigrant employees earn lower hourly wages in more entrepreneurial Communities. but they earn higher wages where co-ethnic entrepreneurs are both numerous and economically successful. Low-skilled immigrant employees earn significantly less in highly entrepreneurial communities than they otherwise would. "
0,"Theoretically derived measures and hypotheses concerning the connection between family ideology, gender ideals, and status attainment levels of conservative Christian women are examined in the twenty-first century. Conservative Christian women have a more intensive view of mothering, a stronger prolife stance, a younger age of childbearing, a higher number of children and a lower education level. These trends tend to intensify for women who convert to conservative churches after the age of 16 and reduce for women who engage in wage-work. A belief in Biblical inerrancy directly reduces educational attainment as does a higher intensity of mothering, a younger age of childbearing, and higher number of children. While there is no discernible direct effect of religiosity on income level, there is an indirect effect that is important to note."
0,"Numerous studies have observed a positive cross-sectional relationship between the size of racial/ethnic minority groups and crime and posited that this relationship is entirely due to a causal effect of minorities on crime rates. We posit that at least some of this relationship might be due to the opposite effect: neighborhood crime increases the number of racial/ethnic minorities. This study employs a sample that allows nesting housing units within census tracts in a number of cities to test the effect of violent crime rates on residential mobility. We find that racial/ethnic transformation occurs due to two effects: first, white households are more likely to exit neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime than are African American households. Second, whites are significantly less likely to move into a housing unit in a tract with more violent crime, particularly if this violent crime rate is increasing. On the other hand, African American and Latino households are more likely to enter neighborhoods with higher levels of violent crime. And Latinos are particularly likely to enter neighborhoods experiencing an increasing level of violent crime over the previous four years."
0,"Marital rates in the US have been on the decline, particularly among African Americans, for decades.  Many policy makers are trying to nudge these rates up by linking more social benefits to marital status. This begs the question: if the goal of welfare states is to reduce inequality, should social provision be linked to marital status?  In this paper, we explore the scholarly and policy debates about the merits and demerits of marriage.  We then focus on the distributional impact of linking old age benefits to martial status.  Since 1939, eligibility for Social Security has been linked to either work or marital history.  We use CPS data to project how declining marital rates will lead to declining eligibility for Social Security spouse and widow benefits, particularly for black women.  While older cohorts will experience only minor changes, we show that when women born in the 1960s reach old age, their eligibility rates will have dropped significantly:  85 percent of Hispanic women, 82 percent of white women, and just 50 percent of African-American women will have been married long enough to qualify for Social Security spouse or widow benefits.  Previous studies have suggested that linking old age benefits to work status magnifies inequality among men and women.  Our study suggests that  linking old age benefits to marital status magnifies inequality among women.  Rather than link social provision to work or marital history, we suggest that a minimum benefit linked to citizenship or residence might more effectively reduce old age inequality."
0,"Global climate change is one of the most severe problems facing societies around the world. Very few assessments of the social forces that influence greenhouse gas emissions have examined gender inequality. Empirical research suggests that women are more likely than men to support environmental protection. Various strands of feminist theory suggest that this is due to women's traditional roles as caregivers, subsistence food producers, water and fuelwood collectors, and reproducers of human life. Other theorists argue that women's status and environmental protection are linked because the exploitation of women and the exploitation of nature are interconnected processes. For these theoretical and empirical reasons, we hypothesize that in societies with greater gender equality there will be relatively lower impacts on the environment, controlling for other factors. We test this hypothesis using quantitative analysis of cross-national data, focusing on the connection between women's political status and CO2 emissions per capita. We find that CO2 emissions per capita are lower in nations where women have higher political status, controlling for GDP per capita, urbanization, industrialization, militarization, world-system position, foreign direct investment, the age dependency ratio, and level of democracy. This finding suggests that efforts to improve gender equality around the world may work synergistically with efforts to curtail global climate change and environmental degradation more generally. "
0,"There is a rich collection of case studies examining the relationship between democratization, women movements, and gendered state outcomes, but the variation across cases is still poorly understood. In response, this article develops a theoretically-grounded comparative framework to evaluate and explain cross-national variations in the gendered outcomes of democratic transitions. The framework highlightsfour theoretical factors-the context of the transition, the legacy of women previous mobilizations, political parties, and international influences-that together shape the political openings and ideologies available to women movements in transitional states. Applying the framework to four test cases, we conclude that women movements are most effective at targeting democratizing states when transitions are complete, when women movements develop cohesive coalitions, when the ideology behind the transition (rather than the ideology of the winning regime) aligns easily with feminist frames, and when women past activism legitimates present-day feminist demands. These findings challenge current conceptualizations of how democratic transitions affect gender in state institutions and provide a comparative framework for evaluating variation across additional cases."
0,"The paper describes and analyses the apparitions of the Virgin Maria in Salta in the north of Argentina. The phenomenon in taking place since 1990. At present thousands of people from all over Argentina gather each Saturday to receive the pray of Maria Livia the lady that sees the Virgin- hoping that she will intercede and that they will get cures for their illness. I describe all the stages of the phenomenon from the beginning, when it was a private issue to Maria Livia, to the moment when she started to make public the messages of the Virgin and certain groups of the Catholic Church supported the issue. I analyze the significance of phenomenon in three of its dimensions: a. the meaning of an ¨apparition¨ of the Virgin at this moment of the Catholicism; b. the meaning this issue has for the different groups that support or react against it, and why the most conservative catholic groups support it; c. the reactions it if provoking within the Catholic Church."
0,"This paper reports findings that assess the relationship between the resurgence in conservative political strength and union density in the United States. The conservative Republican return to political power after 1968 is likely to have produced added declines in union membership. Yet despite close political regulation of labor-management disputes, sociologists have paid little attention to the influential political determinants of success in these contests. Using fixed-effects estimation, this analysis assesses the relationship between the political strength of the political party most hostile to labor and union density. With multiple factors held constant, the results suggest that increased Republican presence in the state legislatures along with Republican control of the presidency and the governor's office after 1989 helped to reduce union memberships. The results also indicate that increases in the percentage of African Americans produces greater union strength but not in the ex-Confederate states. Added findings suggest two policies controlled by the states have influential effects on this outcome. "
0,"This paper is drawn from an original study which analyzes the formation, maintenance, and meanings of family for Black American, Caribbean, and Latina lesbians who are creating families through union formation or childbearing in New York.  The study is one of the first to examine lesbian relationships among women of color and is borne out of two years of participant observation and recruitment efforts.  Data include ethnographic field notes, focus groups, mail-in surveys, and in-depth, face-to-face interviews with approximately 125 women.  This paper tests resource-exchange theories of power in relationships and assumptions of egalitarianism in lesbian headed households.  Preliminary results suggest that the division of labor in lesbian relationships of color is not often egalitarian as defined by studies of Caucasian lesbian-feminists, and the distribution of power may not be as strongly located in the individual who contributes the greatest economic resources, as assumed in research on traditional heterosexual couples.  This work finds that regardless of financial contributions to the relationship the balance of power in these families lies with the person who organizes the household, and in families with children that person is usually the biological mother.  This paper examines the critical importance of children as a resource in lesbian households and relates this source of power to respondents family background.  Women who spent significant amounts of time in single-mother households or whose mothers were primary wage earners create family dynamics in their own relationships that place the biological mother at the center of power."
0,"Can economic ties positively influence social relations and actions? If so, how does this influence operate? Microfinance programs, which provide credit through a group-based lending strategy, provide the ideal setting for exploring these questions. This article examines whether structuring socially isolated women into peer-groups for an explicitly economic purpose, such as access to credit, has any effect on the women collective social behavior Based on interviews with 400 women from 59 microfinance groups in West Bengal, India, I find that one third of these groups undertook various collective actions. Improvements in women,v social capital and normative influence fostered this capacity for collective action. Several factors contributed to these transformations, including economic ties among members, the structure of the group network, and women participation in group meetings. Based on these findings, I argue that microfinance groups have the potential to promote women social capital and normative influence, thereby facilitating women collective empowerment. I conclude by discussing the need for refining our understanding of social capital and social ties that promote normative influence."
0,"Following Tocqueville, many scholars consider associations ""schools of democracy"" because members can develop civic capacities within them. This article identifies the distribution of civic development opportunities across civic sectors (e.g., politics, service, recreation), focusing on understudied apolitical groups. New data is introduced on a set of often referenced, but rarely studied, associations: choral societies. Choruses are shown to offer numerous opportunities for interpersonal interaction, governance experience and institutional relationships. Data are compared to opportunities offered by associations in other civic sectors. Apolitical arts associations are found to provide as many or more opportunities for individual civic development than their politically and service-oriented counterparts suggesting their potential for shrinking the political communication gap between naturally politically interested and disinterested citizens."
0,"This paper uses data from 32 factory workers who worked in one factory for 30 years or more. In it, they discuss their interactions with work and the workplace, and their experiences with social mapping on the shop floor. Here, the factory workers use their perceptions about the social distinctions within the factory environment. They could see this distinctions when they drove into the company parking where white collar workers were given premium parking areas; they could see it by the way they were dressed; by special company bathrooms; and their subjugation to management.  In this paper, workers give their views on their treatment by managers; their thoughts being they were viewed as inferior and subordinate."
0,"This article looks at the fateful 1988 fuselage failure of Aloha Airlines Flight 243 to suggest and illustrate a new perspective on the sociology of technological accidents. Drawing on core insights from the sociology of scientific knowledge, it highlights, and then challenges, a fundamental principle underlying our understanding of technological risk: a realist epistemology that tacitly assumes that technological knowledge is objectively knowable and that ""failures"" always connote ""errors"" that are, in principle, foreseeable. From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the ""epistemic accident,"" grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance."
0,"It has become increasingly important to understand how managers’ embeddedness in social networks has consequences for strategic decision making.   Given this, it is also important to understand how managers become embedded in particular networks.  The research herein addresses this question by examining the formation of managerial advice networks.  Specifically, the work takes a cognitive perspective on social networks and strategic decision making to explore how managers’ interpretations of organizational issues determine which contacts are solicited for advice.  The results from a set of hierarchical linear models suggest that managers who interpret issues through a strategic frame solicit contacts perceived to be accessible, expert, and resource endowed. Managers who interpret issues through a political frame solicit contacts perceived to be trusted and influential.  Given the apparent effects of managerial cognition on the composition of advice networks, we refer to the broader phenomenon as network enactment and discuss its implications for future research."
0,"Organizational scholars rarely look in to consider how organizational processes affect individuals, while educational researchers rarely look out to examine how student outcomes are shaped by broader institutional contexts.  This disjunction between educational and organizational research has produced limited understanding of the relationship between schools and their environments, often leading to expectations of no effects.  I question this null hypothesis of the connection between schools and their environments by investigating how private and community college sectors affect institutional characteristics and student outcomes of public four-year institutions.  I demonstrate that, contrary to neoinstitutional predictions, variation in organizational environments influences characteristics of highly institutionalized organizations, such as public four-year colleges and universities.  Consistent with resource dependence and niche theories, private and community college sectors alter the financial arrangements and internal structures of public four-year institutions.  Moreover, community college sector influences bachelors degree attainment of students attending public four-year institutions.  While schools facilitate sorting of individuals to social positions, they fulfill this role within specific organizational environments."
0,"Plausible arguments have been proposed suggesting that religion is both a source of law-abiding conduct and a source of violence. This paper examines such arguments using data tapping distinct dimensions of religiosity from the World Values Surveys together with data from World Health Organization documents and other sources. The analysis supports several tentative observations: 1) Collective belief systems incorporating both God and the Devil are associated with a higher level of passion and dichotomous good vs evil world views than God only or secular belief systems. 2) Passionate dualism as a characteristic of collective religious beliefs is a strong positive correlate of homicide rates. 3) The association of passionate dualism  with homicide rates among nations is reduced to insignificance when entered into a regression analysis with a dichotomous, good-vs-bad morality as a feature of collective belief systems. The results are consistent with arguments that high homicide rates are facilitated by rigid, dichotomous world views which are, in turn, associated with religious cosmologies characterized by competing deities and related religious passions."
0,"Two literatures on work and the labor market draw attention to the importance of non-pecuniary job amenities. Social psychological perspectives on work suggest that workers have preferences for a range of job amenities (e.g. Halaby, 2003). The compensating differentials hypothesis predicts that workers navigate tradeoffs among different job amenities such that wage inequality overstates inequality in utility (Smith, 1979). This paper joins these perspectives by constructing a new measure of labor market success that evaluates the degree to which workers' job amenity preferences and outcomes match. This measure of subjective success is used to predict workers' job satisfaction and to test the hypothesis that some degree of labor force inequality in wages is due to preference-based tradeoffs among all job amenities. Findings demonstrate that the new measure predicts workers' job satisfaction and provides evidence for the presence of compensating differentials in the primary and intermediate, but not secondary, labor markets.

0,"Relations between the labor and environmental movements exist within a complex web of clashing interests, electoral politics, and attempts to form enduring blue-green coalitions. Unions and other labor organizations are often portrayed as solely interested in economic growth. Environmental organizations are often seen as solely interested in preserving the natural world at the expense of economic growth, thus creating a direct conflict between the interests of labor and environmental organizations. Despite these perceived differences, efforts to bridge the divide between the two movements are increasingly common. This article examines the formation of a collective identity shared by workers and environmentalists participating in the coalition. I develop this argument through an ethnographic analysis of the formation of a blue-green coalition, the Alliance for a Healthy Tomorrow, using in-depth interviews, observations, and content analyses. I demonstrate how coalition leaders and bridge brokers work to bridge and consolidate the identities of labor and environmental groups to campaign for environmental health regulatory changes in Massachusetts."
0,"Despite an ongoing debate over the validity of vignettes, little research has explored either why, or in what research areas, the vignette method may be particularly problematic. In this paper, we draw on Affect Control Theory (ACT) to directly investigate the difference between vignettes and a more experiential method in research on social exchange and alternative dispute resolution. Using ACT's affective dimensions of evaluation, potency, and activity, as well as its concept of deflection, we compare the affective responses of participants in two types of experimental simulations - vignettes and a laboratory experiment. Results suggest that a more tangible experience, like that present in our laboratory experiment, leads to greater deflection, therefore increasing the intensity of emotion and altering affective meanings. We argue that these findings could have important implications for research, particularly in areas exploring affective and cognitive outcomes of interaction. "
0,"As an indicator of social distance and social inequality, interracial cohabitation nonetheless has been attracting little attention in the past few decades. The current study is the first attempt in sociological academic field to examine the influence of demographic characteristics on the likelihoods of interracial cohabitation between whites and minorities in the United States. Using multinomial logistic regression with the national representative data of CPS (2003-2005), the current study investigates the influences of educational attainment on the likelihoods of interracial cohabitation between whites and minorities (Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic) in the United States. With an emphasis on the examination of cohabitations between whites and Asian Americans, this paper finds that whites who are better educated are more likely to cohabit with Asian Americans, compared to whites who cohabit with other minorities. And it is true for both males and females. Additionally, contrary to the common idea that Asians are less likely to cohabit because of their deep-rooted and traditional family values, this paper finds that Asians in the United States have the highest percentage of interracial cohabitation with whites. Both findings indicate that, when taking interracial cohabitation into account, the social distance between Asian Americans and whites in the United States are even smaller than we previously thought."

0,"Do alcohol use and binge drinking among Latina/o adolescents increase in the second and third generation? This study explores generational differences in alcohol use behaviors for three Latina/o ethnic groups. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health on 1504 Latina/o adolescents in secondary school, we found that the factors associated with alcohol use behaviors differed across the Latina/o groups. For Mexican and Cuban adolescents, but not Puerto Ricans, immigrant generation was associated with alcohol use. For Mexican, but not Cuban adolescents, acculturation mediated the effect of immigrant generation on alcohol use behaviors. Although generally social capital and a coethnic presence were protective factors against alcohol use behaviors, we found that some forms of social capital were actually risk factors for Cubans and Puerto Ricans. Our results provide support for segmented-assimilation theory. "
0,"This study addresses the social and cultural underpinnings that shape children's risk of type 2 diabetes, as identified by a racially and economically diverse group of parents and their children living in Anaheim, California. Based on in-depth interviews with 28 adults and 17 children, we explored how they understood what constitutes ""good health"" in children and the aspects of their neighborhoods and communities that acted as resources or impediments to their children's well-being. We found that parents and children employed a language of food that reflected a fear-based, medicalized orientation to food consumption. Although nearly all agreed that children should stay active, densely populated neighborhoods, apartment complexes with rigid outdoor rules, high crime rates, police surveillance, and diminished access to public parks and recreational facilities posed challenges. Similarly problematic were deficits in school lunch programs and the limited sometimes demeaning, conversations with healthcare professionals about diabetes risk and prevention. Together, these narratives identify key structural processes attendant to type 2 diabetes risk in children and call for a more politicized conversation regarding prevention strategies and public healthcare practices."
0,"The existing literature is replete with the adaptation of post-1965 Asian immigrants and their children, but there is little systematic analysis of the impact of post-1965 Asian immigration on American society, an issue that concerns the American public and policymakers. Using a variety of data sources, this paper assesses how post-1965 Asian immigration has impacted the population, race and ethnic relations, economy, sociocultural institutions, and politics of the United States. The results indicate that post-1965 Asian immigration has made a major contribution to the population growth of Asian Americans as a whole and the six major Asian groups, as well as a growing contribution to the total U.S. population.  It has helped transform U.S. race and ethnic composition and relations substantially. Post-1965 Asian immigration has enhanced the quality of the U.S. labor force and helped create jobs through investment and the operation of businesses. Except for Indochinese refugee groups, the majority of post-1965 Asian immigrants are less likely to be welfare assistance program participants than natives. Post-1965 Asian immigration appears to favor the Republican Party and conservatives more than the Democratic Party and liberals."

The results indicate that students with better social skills, work habits, and who participated in extracurricular activities in high school had higher educational attainment and earnings, even after controlling for cognitive skills. Skills and behaviors in high school also explain a substantial portion of the socioecononomic, sex, and racial and ethnic gaps in educational attainment and earnings. "
0,"We ask whether a social contrast mechanism depresses the educational aspirations of students with high-achieving peers. We study two entire cohorts of students in the final grade of the Swedish comprehensive school with matched information on social origin and achievements (160,417 students, 829 schools). Controlling for school fixed effects and observed characteristics of students and families, we find that the propensity to make a high-aspiring choice of upper-secondary school program is lowei-for students with high-achieving schoolmates, given own achievement. While theoretically interesting, the effect is small compared to that of own achievement: Moving an average student from an average school to a school that lies one standard deviation lower in achievement increases the probability of a high-aspiring choice by three percentage points."
0,"Women's wages do not grow with experience or tenure as much as men's do. Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women's underinvestment in firm-specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm-specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high-skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women's disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand-side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in non-formalized labor markets are discussed."
0,"Education plays a central role in globalization literature, particularly as an institutional carrier of the 'plausibility structure' in which a world society makes sense and is taken-for-granted. A solid body of evidence from cross national trends at the macro-societal level have supported these claims, but very little attention has been paid to socialization processes that take place on the ground in schools and classrooms that may shape the way students understand and make sense of the world and their place in it. Using data from a qualitative study of ten schools explicitly committed to “global citizenship education” this paper explores these cultural processes from the bottom up, at the micro level of classrooms and teachers. Specific themes of global citizenship education represent “sacred” elements of an emerging global culture and reveal attempts to create a global consciousness with specific moral demands. Similar to earlier nationalistic contexts of schooling, a particular kind of community and person is imagined, with highly specific obligations and allegiances that orient individuals to society.  In effect, the global consciousness in these classrooms represents a form of the collective conscience of “world society” internalized and enacted by teachers and students."
0,"In this paper, a nationally-representative sample of kindergarten-aged children is used from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study to explore the structure of parental racial designation of mixed-race children. The variation in these parental designations of a variety of combinations of mixed-race children is described. Parental racial designations in the three most common majority-minority interracial couplings  White/Hispanic, Black/White, and Asian/White  are predicted using multinomial logistic regression models. The results may indicate a movement by the parents of these multiracial children away from minority status through racial labeling and towards multiracial and white  movements that are predicated upon social class. A critical discussion of the implications of these results considers the multifaceted reasons why parents are deciding to racially label their children in the ways that they do."
0,"Over the next few decades, the retirement of the baby-boom generation will strain existing programs targeted toward the elderly, such as Social Security and Medicare. To the extent that employer policies can encourage higher rates of labor force participation among older adults, they may be able to soften the potential economic burden of population aging. This study, using the Health and Retirement Study data, evaluates the relationship between labor force participation and two types of health-related employer policies: employer flexibility in number of hours worked and employer-provided health insurance. Particular attention is paid to the distinctions between retirement, reverse retirement, and joint retirement decisions. The findings suggest that while both types of policy provide an incentive for continued employment, the effectiveness of these policies is strongest for workers younger than the typical age of retirement, who are either currently employed or have been employed recently."
0,"This paper explores the health benefits of different kinds of friendships in the lives of older women (aged 55 and older; median age, 67; range 55 to 85 years).  We know a fair amount about the salutary effects of womens friendships, but seldom are the kinds of friendships differentiated with regard to their health-giving aspects (e.g., acquaintance, casual friend, neighbor, co-worker, buddy, mate, partner, close friend, etc.).  This paper addresses that gap by giving voice to older womens understandings of the varied meanings of friendship and by comparing the salutary benefits of different types of relationships that are included under the rubric of friend.  Twenty-six older women were intensively interviewed and their responses were analyzed using grounded theory methodology.  A typology of friendship emerged that illustrates qualitatively different social-support and health-giving functions for different kinds of friends."
0,"Most social scientific research on tolerance rests upon two assumptions: 1). that tolerance is mainly concerned with the extension political rights and 2). that the concept is best understood as a unidimensional continuum of attitudes that are more or less tolerant.  We argue that to have a fuller understanding of tolerance, we must transcend these two assumptions to develop a concept that is multidimensional.  We use latent class analysis to uncover new patterns of tolerant responses to least liked groups.  The results reveal four different profiles, which describe four different approaches to objectionable groups.  These are generally intolerant, politically tolerant, generally tolerant and privately tolerant.  We demonstrate that these four profiles reveal a qualitative dimension to tolerance which augments the unidimensional quantitative approach that is commonly employed in social science research.  We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this new conception of tolerance."
0,"Obstetric fistula is one of the most degrading and debilitating morbidities resulting from obstructed labor which is not relieved in time by a cesarean section. Consequently the blood supplying the tissues of the vagina and the bladder is cut off, causing the tissues to necrotize and a hole to form, leaving the woman incontinent of urine, feces, or both. Most of the women who develop fistulas are often abandoned by their husbands, rejected by their communities and forced to live an isolated existence. Despite being a major public health problem, obstetric fistula has been relatively less researched in the field of reproductive health comparatively to female genital cutting. Most of the published research on fistula in developing countries comes from the clinical field and focused on fistula treatment and repair. Knowledge on the magnitude as well as on the characteristics of the women affected by the morbidity is still limited. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the socioeconomic determinants of obstetric fistula using the first effort of data collected by the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) in Uganda and Kenya."
0,"We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States."
0,"This article presents the first large-scale audit study of discrimination against openly gay men in the United States. Pairs of fictitious resumes were sent in response to 1,769 job postings in seven states. One resume in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization, and the other resume was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged. First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and antidiscrimination laws. Second, employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by highlighting how audit techniques may be used to identify stereotypes that affect employment decisions in real labor markets."
0,"Hip-hop is a popular music genre that has generated a multi-billion dollar industry. Although its gender and race relations have historically been problematic, they have recently transformed in particular ways. This study examines the forty-one best-selling rap videos of 2007-2008. Through a qualitative content analysis of videos and lyrics several themes emerged. Hip-hop's focus on conspicuous consumption, buttressed by the success of entrepreneurial rap moguls, has merged with strip club culture to create a new gender relation based on sexual transaction. The ""rap lifestyle,"" marketed to consumers through multiple media outlets, focuses on the consumption of designer clothes, jewelry, cars, and liquor, often sold by the rap moguls' companies. Rap music videos advertise these products, as well as the consumption of women of color's sexual performances. The new hip-hop gender relation has also transformed the politics of dancing to fit the strip club themes of consumption and sexual transaction."
0,"Both advocacy for and critiques of the Human Genome Project assume a self-sustaining relationship between genetics and medicalization. However, this assumption ignores the ways in which the meanings of genetic research are conditional on its position in sequences of events. Based on analyses of three conditions for which at least one putative gene or genetic marker has been identified, this article argues that critical junctures in the institutional stabilization of phenotypes and the mechanisms that sustain such classifications over time configure the practices and meanings of genetic research. Path dependence is critical to understanding the lack of consistent fit between genetics and medicalization."
0,"One of the unintended consequences of decades-long public housing policy has been to concentrate the poor within communities that are at the extreme end of economic disadvantage. More than in other types of disadvantaged communities, living in public housing can sharply circumscribe the social world of its residents and isolate them from people and social institutions in surrounding areas. This study draws on the concepts of social isolation from urban sociology and offending ""awareness space"" from environmental criminology to explain why violence rates are dramatically higher in public housing compared to otherwise disadvantaged nonpublic housing neighborhoods and, moreover, whether residents or outsiders are responsible for the violence. Using homicide data for the Southeast Policing Area of Los Angeles (1980 through 1999), and relating the location of homicides within and outside of public housing to the places of residence of both victims and offenders, our research reveals that public housing developments are hotbeds of violence involving predominantly local residents. There is no evidence that public housing serves as either a magnet for violence by drawing in nonlocal offenders, or a generator of violence in surrounding neighborhoods. We conclude that this social isolation from the larger community can both escalate violence between residents inside public housing, but also limit their offending awareness space, such that the violence is contained from spreading beyond the development."
0,"Intimate partner violence is most common in early adulthood. A key developmental task of young adulthood is the formation of intimate partner relationships whether through dating, cohabitation, or marriage. Using the first and third waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examine the linkages between relationship type and relationship violence perpetration and victimization among young adults, emphasizing the mediating role of relationship commitment. Among women, cohabitors report significantly higher levels of relationship violence than either marrieds or daters. Among men, cohabitors and marrieds report similar levels of relationship violence and both groups experience more violence perpetration and victimization than daters. Our hypothesis that the weaker relationship commitment of cohabitors accounts for their higher levels of violence is not supported. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"The concept of function is generally regarded as a core methodological device of Parsonian action theory. It is  entirely indispensable in sociology, as Parsons noted in one of his late programmatic essays. Instead of the label structural-functionalism he would prefer the more accurate expression functional analysis as suggested by Robert Merton. It was both the intellectual movement that criticized Parsons  frequently as an arch-functionalist  as well as the one seeking a positive reevaluation of his legacy known under the label of neo-functionalism that took the centrality of the concept of function for granted. This obvious common sense is contrasted by the fact that there is little explicit discussion and no systematic treatment of functional methodology in sociology. The major part of arguments pro and contra functionalism is developed around substantial assumptions in action theory such as the place of values or norms as opposed to interests, of culture as opposed to economy, of consensus as opposed to conflict, or of supposed political implication such as an allegedly conservative strand etc. All these arguments do not touch the question of functional methodology as such. This paper aims to reconstruct the largely implicit assumptions of functionalism and argues in line with Parsons for its indispensable status for a theory of action. On the whole, functional analysis is taken as an important tool to overcome a naïve concept of causality and, consequently, a mechanistic understanding of action, particularly of the interconnectedness of action systems, their subsystems, and their respective environments."
0,"Pierre Bourdieu provides a number of comprehensive theories on social relations.  These theories can be extended to explain the effect of cultures, which are intervening variables reflected in health outcomes.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity continues to be a health concern for adults, children and adolescents in the United States.  There is support for three primary factors that contribute to obesity, behavior, genetics, and environment.  Since it is quite evident how behavior and genetics play a role in obesity, there is emerging research into the impact of environments, including neighborhoods, on health outcomes.  This paper utilizes Bourdieus theories to explain the influence of neighborhoods on obesity as a health outcome by exploring current research in the area."
0,"The evolution of the polity, particularly the transition of chiefdoms to states, has been the subject of considerable debate. In this article, the authors engage the discussion surrounding the meta-theoretical positions on the tempo of change, specifically whether states emerged gradually from quantitative changes in chiefdom societies-gradualism-or if their appearance was the result of punctuated and qualitative change-punctuated equilibrium. After revisiting the classic debate, the authors update it with new contributions drawn from the natural and social sciences. They contend that chiefdoms do not simply become states as a result of increases in the size of component parts; instead, punctuated equilibrium, stemming from responses to selection pressures from social forces, has more empirical support than gradualism in explaining state formation. The authors then take steps toward an integrative model of polity evolution, in which the state emerges as a discrete change resulting from social forces reaching critical thresholds."
0,"This paper test predictions from three social science explanations as to how sex differences in attainment of partnership and how women's perceptions of sex discrimination should have changed as women have been integrated into law. Men's and women's partnership rates 15 years after graduation and women's reports of sex discrimination are compared for two cohorts of University of Michigan Law School graduates: the classes of 1972 to 1978 and the classes of 1979 to 1985. Four stages at which women are selected out of, or select themselves out of, the path to partnership are investigated: (1) career plans at graduation; (2) entry into a firm; (3) early attrition from firm practice; and (4) the attainment of partnership among non-attriters. The sex gap in attaining partnership dropped across cohorts, primarily due to declines in sex differences at the first three stages; but sex differences in the percentage of non-attriters who were partners 15 years after graduation declined little across cohorts, both before and after controlling for career plans, legal specialization, work experience, law school grades, and family situations. And in both cohorts, roughly 90 percent of women reported experiences of sex discrimination. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"This study explores the predictors of religious participation among US immigrants. We analyze data from the General Social Surveys (GSS), along with contextual data from 30 nations derived from the World Values Survey and the World Christian Encyclopedia (WCE). We compare the rates of religious participation of first and second generation immigrants to GSS respondents of more distant immigrant waves. We also compare the predictors of religious participation across nativity groups, and examine the influence of demographic, denominational, and contextual-level religious market factors on immigrants' religious participation using hierarchical linear models (HLM). We find that immigrant religious participation is similar to other Americans, and that second generation immigrants with a single immigrant parent are the least active. Immigrants with ties to sectarian Christian groups or to the Catholic Church are significantly more active than other immigrants. Neither religious diversity in the country of origin nor the differences from the US market have a significant effect on immigrants' religious participation. However, immigrants from Catholic nations have high rates of participation, while immigrants from nations with high rates of apostasy have lower rates of participation net of individual factors. "
0,"Although there is considerable evidence linking success-including wealth, marriage, and friendships-to happiness, this relationship might not reflect, as is often assumed, the effects of the proximate environment on well-being. Such an interpretation is contravened by evidence that both happiness and the environment are influenced by genetic factors and family upbringing. Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, which includes a sub-sample of twins, this study evaluates the relationship between happiness and various features of success before and after eliminating the influence of endowments. The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well. Yet the results also suggest that the role of genetic endowments varies considerably across different features of success, suggesting complex patterns of selection, reinforcement, and causation among genes and the environment."
0,"This article reevaluates traditional racial and gender disparities in the work satisfaction literature by examining the US. military: an institution that has ameliorated many racial inequalities while exacerbating gender conflict. The military departs from civilian society in some analytically useful ways, making it a unique, though underutilized, setting for examining inequality. Using data from the Pentagon 1999 Survey of Active Duty Personnel (SADP), results suggest that black males and females, Latino males and females, and white females all experience greater perceived benefits to military service than do white males along several dimensions of self-assessed job satisfaction and quality of life. Perceptions of advantage relative to civilian reference group comparisons largely explain these findings. I conclude by discussing how the structure of organizations can be powerful enough to reverse differences in relative satisfaction among key status groups."
0,"The more capitalism develops, the greater the number of people become proletariat; this is a thesis that is often attributed to Marx. If globalization is understood to mean the global expansion of capitalism, then this should suggest that, given Marxs thesis, an increasing number of people in the world are becoming proletariat. Both Sassen and Portes deny this is the case. Sassen argues that there is the resurgence of the informal proletariat in what she calls global cities while Portes notes the persistence of the informal proletariat in Latin America despite its long period of continuous capitalist development. Even if the classical Marxist thesis is mistaken about the presumed growth of the proletariat, this paper will show how the informal proletariat can be accounted for in the theories of the Neo-Marxists such as Althusser and Wallerstein and demonstrate how their theories provide a more powerful conceptual framework within which we can analyze the different types of labor accompanying globalization."
0,"Though the past three decades have witnessed an explosion of research on domestic violence, the existing literature does not study the role of the body in reflecting and sustaining gendered power inequality between batterers and battered women.  Heeding Groszs (1994) call to centralize the body in our understanding of gender, we find that a gendered and hierarchical mind/body dichotomy occupies a central, though rarely acknowledged, place in the power and control dynamics at the heart of domestic violence.  Using Foucault (1979, in Rabinow, 1984) and Scarry (1985), we can begin to elaborate a corporeal framework for understanding batterers' use of violence against and creation of pain in battered women's bodies.  Through in-depth interviews with 20 batterers and 15 battered women, we find empirical evidence that violence and pain play a role in batterers association of themselves with the idealized mind and their relegation of battered women to the denigrated realm of the body.  Specifically, the current study reports on batterers denial of their bodies, their exploitation of battered womens physical vulnerabilities, and the unique role of battered womens injuries.  The current study represents an empirically-based expansion of traditional understandings of domestic violence that more holistically incorporates the body and embodied experience."
0,"This study uses a factorial vignette design embedded in an Internet survey to investigate attitudes toward an adult child and parent living together in response to economic hardship. Over half of Americans said the desirability of intergenerational co-residence depends on particularistic aspects of the family, notably the quality of family relationships. Support for co-residence is greatest when the adult child is single rather than partnered. Support is weaker if the adult child is cohabiting rather than married to the partner, although groups with greater exposure to cohabitation make less of a distinction between cohabitation and marriage. Presence of a grandchild does not affect views about co-residence. There is more support for sharing a home when a mother needs a place to live than when the adult child does. Responses to open-ended questions show that individuals invoke both universalistic family obligations and particularistic qualities of family relationships to explain their attitudes.

0,"Theorized links between science and secularism are prevalent in classic sociological thought. More recently, scholars have critiqued these frameworks as oversimplified and empirically untenable. In response to such criticisms, contemporary researchers typically overlook or actively argue against links between science and secularism. This study analyzes data from a random, national survey of adults to examine the empirical connections between perceptions of science and secular identities in the United States. Analyses demonstrate that perceptions of science correlate strongly with American secularism, particularly among atheists and agnostics. Additionally, politicized views of science help account for the previously documented relationship between political and secular identities in the United States. A perspective drawing on the sociology of culture and perceived knowledge provides a more useful framework for understanding these patterns than theories of secularization."
0,"Using Swedish panel data, we assess whether the gender gap in supervisory authority has changed during the period 1968-2000, and investigate to what extent the gap can be attributed to gender-specific consequences of family formation. The results indicate that the gap has narrowed modestly during the period, and that the life-event of parenthood is a major cause. As long as women and men are childless and single, the gender gap in supervisory authority is marginal, even reversed. When men become fathers, however, they strongly increase their chances for supervisory authority whereas women's chances remain unaffected when they become mothers. We also find a male ""marriage premium"" on workplace authority, but this premium is generated by selection."
0,"The purpose of this research is to explain the variation in the utilization of drug therapy for the medical conditions of depression, high cholesterol, and hypertension between Hispanics. non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanics whites using Oaxaca-type decomposition analysis based on logit estimates. We find that almost the entire share of the utilization differences in drug therapy between blacks and whites can be explained by the differences in the coefficients of observable characteristics, while the sources of the utilization difference between the whites and Hispanics are split between the differences in the observable characteristics and the coefficient estimates. This result implies that strategies to improve racial and ethnic disparities need to be tailored to each group by focusing on the specific factors that are attributed to causing the disparity. "
0,"Emerging theories of corporate social responsibility (CSR) frame it largely as a market-driven response to signals from consumers and investors.  As one component of a larger project to re-theorize CSR in more political terms, we focus on the role of social movement pressure in shaping CSR at the firm and field levels.  Using data on apparel and footwear firms in the 1990s, we demonstrate four main points:  (1) Social movement campaigns shaped external, field-level evaluations of firms social performance, generating new information about labor practices and serving as a prime mover for CSR in this arena.  (2) While social movement pressure spurred a search for solutions among companies, one prominent responsethe corporate code of conductin fact required no firm-specific movement pressure for its adoption.  Instead, this low-cost, largely symbolic practice spread quickly through the industry and was adopted by many firms that had not been the target of activism.  (3) On the other hand, CSR practices that require firms to sacrifice even a small degree of autonomy depend more directly on social movement pressure.  Firm-specific pressure was a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for large corporations to participate in multi-stakeholder monitoring/certification associations.  (4) The intensity of social movement pressure increases the likelihood of participating in a multi-stakeholder association, even controlling for reputational investments that may also give firms an interest in CSR."
0,"This presentation considers the relationship of novel forms of communications media to alternative public spheres and explores the relationship between such alternative public spheres and civil society more generally.  Through qualitative research on a new Low Power FM (LPFM) station in a conservative county of Eastern California, I provide a grounded analysis of an actually existing public sphere and consider its impact on local civil society.  I then briefly relate the impact of these findings to conflicting evidence of the decline of social capital (Putnam, 2000) on the one hand, and a renewal of civic engagement and participation in modern American society, on the other (Siriani and Friedland, 2001)."
0,"This paper compares the public funding of kindergarten in the last two decades of the 19th century and of pre-kindergarten over the past 15 years as parallel instances of educations accommodation to rapid social change via an ideological alignment between education and the care of young children.  I argue that the adoption of two new grades to American public schooling was an institutional response to shaken social understandings of womens proper connection to family and work, and that the catalyst for the response was congruence in logics permitting the care of children to be framed as a legitimate function of public schools.  Education acted to legitimize the role of women as teacher-mothers of sacralized children in the late 19th century, according with womens confinement to the domestic sphere.  Similarly, education has acted to legitimize the role of women as workers upon their return to the economic sphere in the late 20th century; institutionalization of pre-kindergarten into public schooling creates an understanding of the public care of young children as beneficial development of cognitive abilities, rather than warehousing of children in substandard care while mothers work.  I utilize secondary historical texts and media accounts to support this argument at the macro-institutional level, establishing the similar demographic conditions between the periods and a chronology and associated narrative of the adoption of kindergarten and pre-kindergarten into the mission of public schools."

My analysis focuses especially on the Environmental Genome Project, a flag raising initiative of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which endeavored to establish environmental susceptibility disease genes, environmental response genes, and the environmental genome for use in environmental health science research, risk assessment, and regulation."
0,"In this article, we add to the literature on feeling over- or underworked (hour mismatch) by examining the influence of work and family relationships; social stratification (occupation, education, financial stability); household labor (hours of housework and childcare); and attitudes toward paid and unpaid labor. Our analysis of hour mismatches is informed by several theories, including Jacobs and Gerson's dual-earner couple hypothesis and notion of the polarization of the workforce and Hochschild's reversed worlds hypothesis. We use the 1994 Americans' Changing Lives data, splitting the sample by sex in our analysis. Our findings indicate that hours spent on childcare affect men's hour mismatches, while hours spent on housework affect women's. In addition, we find that attitudes toward housework and paid labor play an important role in tempering perceptions of hour mismatches. Our findings illustrate the way that gender structures perceptions of ideal work hours and the ability to achieve them."
0,"In this paper I explore the widely taken-for-granted connection between (a) growing up in an employed-mother household and (b) having more egalitarian gender role attitudes (GRA) than do peers who grew up in non-employed mother households.  Both popular and academic sources have constructed their relationship as intuitive and automatic.  Exploiting intergenerational data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979), I present a uniquely comprehensive and synthetic investigation of this association. Analyses show that the influence of maternal employment on youth sociopolitical attitudes has been oversimplified. It is in fact complex, contingent, and cannot be taken for granted.  The effect of maternal employment on youth GRA is dependent on factors that make the mother a more influential figure in the eyes of their children (e.g., economic power, positive parent-youth interactions, self-efficacy) and on factors that make being a working mother seem feasible, enjoyable, and/or edifying (e.g., job satisfaction, feelings of usefulness, self-efficacy).  The effect does not exist without satisfying at least some of these criteria.  Implications for theories of socialization and working families; the opt-out debate; and child agency/subjectivity are discussed."
0,"This article examines contextual models to bring together the disorder and community capacity perspectives, since both are grounded in social (dis) organization theory and cumulative causation. We analyze how individual and neighborhood characteristics, social and physical disorder, and crime affect three individual community capacity outcomes: city quality of life, neighborhood safety, and household moving intentions. The ""broken windows"" downward spiral suggests that neighborhood incivilities may decrease multiple psychosocial assessments, or, individual community capacities. Consistent with prior research, we find that social and physical disorder decreases all three outcomes. Second, we find that both disorders also mediate neighborhood effects, including socioeconomic status and residential stability. Third, these direct and indirect disorder effects are not altered by prior victimization or neighborhood crime rates. Reducing disorder will, in turn, improve three distinct domains and geographic scales of individual community capacity, and can also reduce the adverse effects of other local area capacity deficits."
0,"Public awareness of infertility has increased dramatically in recent years both in the mainstream and academically. In the medical community infertility is defined as the inability to conceive a pregnancy after one year of trying through unprotected sexual intercourse. Herein, the author illustrates that beyond the support and understanding exchanged in the online infertility community, women make sense of their circumstances by characterizing them as unfair and unjust. An examination of this characterization indicates that the quest to achieve an embodied gender norm, such as motherhood, elicits expressions of anger, incredulity, misery and disbelief among women. In these expressions women make conjectures about who deserves to be a mother, developing schemas of deservedness and scales of comparison. The author argues that women’s characterization of infertility as unjust—alongside their evaluations and comparisons—illustrates how the gendered norm of motherhood is more aptly conceptualized as a gendered entitlement or right, which is produced relationally and comparatively. Interestingly, women in the online infertility community aim to prove their proximity to motherhood, claiming entitlement to the role, through a reliance on social biographical markers (i.e., class, relationship status, stability etc.,), despite a tireless pursuit to conceive a child with which they share a biological connection."
0,"Twenty years ago an influential article in Teaching Sociology called upon instructors of research methods to design courses involving meaningful student participation in the entire research process (Takata and Leiting 1987).  These authors, however, do not seem to have envisioned either the higher enrolments of the current generation of research methods courses or the requirement at many institutions that bona fide course-based research undergo formal human subjects ethics review.  Here we evaluate a complete research project, specifically a study of student life, which we undertook as students and instructor of a large compulsory undergraduate qualitative methods course.  We show how the pedagogical promise of complete research projects can be realized, even in high-enrolment courses and under the new university ethics policies, but not without compromises to models such as Takata and Leitings."
0,"Research on immigrant entrepreneurs in the US has focused on small businesses in the retail and food service sectors rather than on high technology startups.  Research on women and immigrants in the US science and technology workforce has focused on academia rather than scientists in industry.  This paper aims to bridge the gaps in these two literatures by examining the role of women and immigrants in founding science-based biotechnology firms.  This research thus speaks to the sociological perspective on power inequalities for women and foreign-born people in entrepreneurship and in the US science/technology workforce.  Opportunities and barriers vary by organizational context, and the flexibility of the biotechnology industry has previously been found to benefit women scientists. But what of foreign-born scientists and women who play founding roles in biotech firms?  A survey conducted of 261 biotechnology firms located in Massachusetts and New England in 2006 provides the data.  The results show that 42% of the firms had at least one foreign-born founder, and 21% of firms had at least one woman founder.  These numbers suggest that foreign-born life scientists are well represented and women life scientists are somewhat underrepresented in founding roles in biotech.  The role of entrepreneurs who have the double status of women immigrants is less clear and needs further study.  The research finds significant variation in biotech entrepreneurship of immigrants by their world region of origin.  Interviews supplement the survey data to illustrate the barriers and opportunities for foreign-born biotech entrepreneurs."
0,"The financial architecture of the world economy since the 1980s has featured the US as the world's largest debtor, and, increasingly, countries outside the core as its creditors.  Critics have predicted the unraveling of this arrangement for quite some time, yet is has been maintained, much to the benefit of certain domestic constituencies within the US.  We argue that, given the defeat of the US in Iraq and the trends in financial imbalances between core and periphery, this relationship has the potential to change.  Specifically, new data from UNCTAD points to increased economic ties among regions in the South.  Political realignments that are still in their initial stages could portend a future world-system where Southern states have increasing leverage against the North, if perceptions of US decline are taken seriously by these states."
0,"According to Victor Frankl, purpose in life is one of the most powerful sources of inner strength and can literally make the difference between life and death in extreme circumstances. This study examined the effects of purpose in life versus religiosity on subjective well-being and fear of death in a sample of 164 older (58+) community residents, hospice patients, and nursing home residents. Results show that purpose in life is the strongest positive predictor of subjective well-being and the strongest negative predictor of death anxiety. After controlling for purpose in life, intrinsic religiosity is unrelated to subjective well-being and fear of death, and extrinsic religiosity and religious affiliation actually have a positive effect on death anxiety. Further analyses revealed that hospice patients and nursing home residents who found purpose and meaning in life despite trying circumstances had a significantly higher average score on subjective well-being and, in the case of nursing home residents, a significantly lower average score on fear of death than those with a weak sense of purpose in life. Excerpts of qualitative interviews with two hospice patients and one nursing home resident illustrate how individualistic, collective, and cosmic meaning in life might affect older adults subjective well-being."
0,"The Protestant Reformation swept across Central Europe in the early-sixteenth century, leaving cities divided into Evangelical and Catholic camps as some instituted reforms and others remained loyal to the Roman Church. In offering a new explanation of the Reformation, we develop a theory that identifies ideologically mobilized students as bridge actors-that is, agents of religious contention who helped concatenate incidents of local insurgency into a loosely organized Evangelical movement by bridging structural holes. Building on existing literature, we offer a novel way to measure the influence of contending religious movements through university enrollments; we propose that the institution of reform can be partially explained by the varying degree of exposure that cities had to Evangelical activist and Catholic loyalist university students. Based on statistical analysis of a novel dataset comprising cities in the Holy Roman Empire with a population of 2,000 or more from 1523 to 1545, we find support for the role of university students as bridge actors linking critical communities at universities to arenas of urban contention. The greater a city's exposure to heterodox ideology through city-to-university ties, the greater its odds of instituting the Reformation."
0,"Earnings inequality has grown in recent decades in the United States, yet research investigating the motherhood wage penalty has not fully considered how the penalty itself, and the mechanisms producing it, may vary among low-wage, middle-wage, and high-wage workers. Pooling data from the 1979 to 2004 waves of the NLSY and using simultaneous quantile regression methods with fixed effects, we test whether the size of the motherhood penalty differs across the distribution of white women's earnings, and whether the mechanisms explaining this penalty vary by earnings level. Results show that having children inflicts the largest penalty on low-wage women, proportionately, although a significant motherhood penalty persists at all earnings levels. We also find that the mechanisms creating the motherhood penalty vary by earnings level. Family resources, work effort, and compensating differentials account for a greater portion of the penalty among low earners. Among highly paid women, by contrast, the motherhood penalty is significantly smaller and largely explained by lost human capital due to childbearing. Our findings show that estimates of average motherhood penalties obscure the compounded disadvantage mothers face at the bottom of the earnings distribution, as well as differences in the type and strength of mechanisms that produce the penalty."
0,"This study, drawing on approximately 1,100 males from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, demonstrates the importance of genetics, and genetic-environmental interactions, for understanding adolescent delinquency and violence. Our analyses show that three genetic polymorphisms-specifically, the 30-bp promoter-region variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in MAOA, the 40-bp VNTR in DAT1, and the Taq1 polymorphism in DRD2-are significant predictors of serious and violent delinquency when added to a social-control model of delinquency. Importantly, findings also show that the genetic effects of DRD2 and MAOA are conditional and interact with family processes, school processes, and friendship networks. These results, which are among the first that link molecular genetic variants to delinquency, significantly expand our understanding of delinquent and violent behavior and they highlight the need to simultaneously consider their social and genetic origins."
0,"Little is known about the language acquisition of refugees in Western countries. This study examines how pre- and post-migration characteristics of refugees are related to their second language proficiency. Data are from a survey of 3,500 refugees, who were born in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and who resided in the Netherlands. The analysis shows that speaking and reading skills are better among refugees who received more pre-migration schooling, who migrated from a major city, and who arrived in the host country at a younger age. Post-migration characteristics are also important. Language skills are better among refugees who only lived in a refugee reception center for a short while, who completed an integration course, who received post-migration education, who intend to stay in the host country, and who have fewer health problems."
0,"Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey and Lareau's concept of concerted cultivation-the idea that educational and financial resources result in different cultural logics in the approach to parenting-the authors examine racial and educational differences in the relationship between parenting practices during elementary school and teachers' evaluations of students' (1) language and literacy skills, (2) approaches to learning, and (3) interpersonal skills. The authors find that both race and education affect the relationship between parenting practices and teachers' evaluations. Children in college-educated white families whose parents volunteer receive higher scores on all dependent variables, while white children in high-school-educated families receive lower evaluations the more often their parents attend conferences. Children in college-educated African American families consistently experience negative academic consequences when their parents make special requests of the school. These findings imply that parental investments do not necessarily translate into equal educational rewards."
0,"In the wake of the considerable cultural changes and societal shifts that beset the United States and all advanced industrial democracies since the late 1960s and early 1970s, one can also observe a completely altered manner as to how humans in these societies have come to relate to animals, dogs in particular. One of the new institutions created by this novel attitude and behavior towards dogs has been the many breed rescues that emerged all over the United States beginning in the 1980s. Like many other institutions and structures in the world of human  animal relations, the world of dog rescue has also witnessed a massive preponderance of women at every level. In this paper, we present some key findings of research on canine breed rescue organizations in the state of Michigan, specifically addressing the question of why more women are involved in these organization than are men. While a blossoming scholarship on the changed dimension of the human  animal relationship attests to its social, political and intellectual salience to our contemporary world, we are reasonably certain that this work constitutes the first academic research on canine rescue and the people involved in it."

More specifically, researchers have begun to analyze the varieties of multiple identities comprising an individuals self-concept and its consequences for psychological well-being (Thoits 1992, 2003).  Other work on psychological well-being emphasizes the effects of socioeconomic status on depression, esteem and worth (Kessler 1982; Turner 1999).  In this paper I seek to determine the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), multiple identities and psychological well-being.  In recent sociological social psychological literature on multiple identities, Thoits (1992) distinguishes between voluntary and obligatory identities.  I find unique effects between SES and voluntary identities when examining their effects on psychological well-being.  The effects of voluntary identities on psychological well-being are spurious when controlling for an individuals level of education. However, the effects of voluntary identities on psychological well-being remained significant when controlling for income and occupational prestige.  In the latter case, voluntary identities are a mediating factor in the relationship between income, occupational prestige, and rates of psychological well-being.  The implications of the findings for this study of social stratification, multiple identities and psychological well-being are discussed."
0,"This article examines the intersection between collective memory and autobiographical memory through in-depth interviews with twenty whites who came of age in the midst of key events in the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham, Alabama. Most interviewees report few autobiographical memories of the events of the Civil Rights Movement and the racial conflict surrounding these events. Instead, many center their recollections on the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. The forgetting of autobiographical memories has been aided by a coalition of silence among whites about the era of integration and by reiterated media images that shaped recollections of the past. These white southerners have been able to renarrativize their pasts to forget memories that link them with the ideology of segregation and to reconstruct the self to be usable in the present. The article demonstrates ways that autobiographical memory is a social construction rather than an act of retrieval."
0,"A critical issue in the social sciences is the problem of social order, or how society resolves the tension between individual and collective interests. Classic sociological solutions to the problem were rooted in the moral judgments group members make about one another’s behaviors, but more recent research on prosocial behaviors has largely ignored this foundational literature. Here we extend theoretical accounts of the social impact of moral judgments. We argue that those who engage in moral judgment subsequently perceive themselves to be more moral and therefore act more morally. Further, we argue that group members anticipate the more moral behavior of judges, trusting them more under situations of risk and uncertainty. We present the results of two laboratory experiments that support the predicted effects: Participants randomly assigned to make moral judgments were more trustworthy in subsequent interactions (Experiment 1) and audience members anticipated the greater trustworthiness of moral judges (Experiment 2). Taken together results of the two studies clarify how moral judgments can increase levels of productivity in groups and societies."
0,"This article examines factors associated with social movements' abilities to disrupt corporate targets. I identify two kinds of disruption: market disruption and mediated disruption. Market disruption deters the ability of the corporate target to effectively accrue and use market resources, while mediated disruption occurs as a tactic communicates a movement's claims about the target through third party intermediaries, like the media, thereby disrupting the target's image and reputation. Using data on corporate boycotts in the United States from 1990 to 2005, the analyses assess the extent to which movement characteristics or target characteristics cause stock price declines of boycotted companies-i.e., market disruption-and the frequency of national media attention given to boycotts-i.e., mediated disruption. The analyses indicate that target characteristics matter more in shaping a boycott's initial market disruption; however, both movement and target characteristics affect mediated disruption. Certain movement characteristics, like social movement organization (SMO) formality, public demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements, enable mediated disruption but have no effect on market disruption. A firm's size makes it vulnerable to both market and mediated disruption, while slack resources help a firm avoid market disruption. A target's reputational ranking initially buffers it from market disruption but increases its vulnerability to mediated disruption. The results indicate that the two kinds of disruption are interrelated. Market disruption has a marginal effect on the intensity of subsequent media coverage and ongoing media attention accentuates further market disruption."
0,"Ethnographic fieldwork was conducted over a six-week long period in Downtown Los Angeles during the summer of 2005.  Specifically, a tourist route to the districts main attractions mapped the projects geographically boundaries.  Much research has been published on the downtowns carceral and exclusionary character  with undesirables serving as targets.  This study, in essence, seeks to reevaluate these claims.  More nuanced portraits of two features are described: 1) how undesirables are removed from segregated areas  essentially, implicit and indirect tactics are used; and 2) how the role of law and order symbols change to reproduce normal society in each of the areas studied.  New insights include: how 1) undesirables have been able to create viable public-spaces in the Civic Center area; and 2) that undesirables resist domination in specific ways.  Problems with the research mainly involve its limitation to day-time study."
0,"Intersectoral collaborations connect organizations across institutional domains, providing a conduit for transposing practices and structures. While new practices and structures offer a source of innovation, they also expose the importer to contradictory evaluative criteria. Partner organizations that are the source of practices and structures, especially those that also control resources, may exert isomorphic pressures on the importer. Institutional incumbents may challenge the legitimacy of the importing organization on the grounds that they no longer conform to extant institutional precepts. The importing organization is left in a state of sociological ambivalence, in which it is subject to competing institutional expectations. This paper explains the process and outcomes of this particular form of sociological ambivalence by examining the case of an entrepreneurial nonprofit organization that collaborates closely with for-profit organizations"
0,"Literary theorists have, by and large, argued that the feminist novelfor adult readersis a relatively modern literary form, having been established as a recognizable literary genre during the 1970s on the heels of the modern feminist movement. I will argue, in contrast, that novels for children, which can be distinguished as feminist, were more easily published by the editors of childrens book divisions well before the second wave of the American feminist movement. This paper builds on Wendy Griswolds work in the sociology of culture, and is motivated by two goals: to explore and improve definitions of a feminist novel and to analyze two notable American childrens books in terms of their production, content, and feminism. I have selected two books for this case study from the list of Newbery Medal winning childrens books; the first won this prestigious award in 1930 and the second in 1980, exactly fifty years later. Both childrens novels are analyzed in terms of their content and the circumstances of their production, in order to explore the relative feminism of both texts. A brief social history of childrens book publishing is provided so that connections between the novels feminist content and production might be established."
0,"This study examines non-traditional notions of masculinity among young men in an alternatives-to-incarceration program in New York City by analyzing focus group data collected from 38 men.  The paper utilizes urban ethnographic studies of masculinity and theory on progressive masculinities and crime as a framework for analysis of findings.  Men in this study define their own masculinity primarily as supporting family, but emphasize caretaking and maintenance of the household as part of being a real man, skills they learn from women in their families.  They also discuss roles of fathers and children, being there for kids emotionally, physically, and recognizing childrens autonomy.  Finally the men in this study talk about masculinity in terms of love received and love given. The findings from this study illustrate to some degree notions of a progressive masculinity.  This paper concludes by providing suggestions for improving outcomes for young men involved in alternatives-to-incarceration programs."
0,"Power is at the core of feminist theories of sexual harassment, although it has rarely been measured directly in terms of workplace authority. Popular characterizations portray male supervisors harassing female subordinates, but power-threat theories suggest that women in authority may be more frequent targets. This article analyzes longitudinal survey data and qualitative interviews from the Youth Development Study to test this idea and to delineate why and how supervisory authority, gender nonconformity, and workplace sex ratios affect harassment. Relative to nonsupervisors, female supervisors are more likely to report harassing behaviors and to define their experiences as sexual harassment. Sexual harassment can serve as an equalizer against women in power, motivated more by control and domination than by sexual desire. Interviews point to social isolation as a mechanism linking harassment to gender nonconformity and women's authority, particularly in male-dominated work settings."
0,"This paper engages two core ideas: first, that status mobility is facilitated through connectivity, or having a large number of ties to others, as suggested by theories of social capital and social networks; and second, that aggression is an expressive or irrational reaction to frustrations, humiliations, or social pathologies. In contrast, I argue that in certain contexts, both of these propositions are reversed: status is attained through selective bridging rather than high network connectivity, and aggression is instrumental for social climbing, particularly when it is directed toward high status, aggressive, or socially close targets. The argument is expected to hold only in contexts that are small (in terms of the number of participants), bounded (in terms of the ease and frequency with which they are entered and exited), and flat (in terms of formal hierarchy). Data from a longitudinal survey of adolescents combined with information from their high school yearbooks provide a unique opportunity to test these propositions, which are supported. High connectivity decreases the likelihood of attaining high status, while selective bridging increases it. Status is further enhanced by reputational, as opposed to physical, aggression, and decreased by victimization. Moreover, aggression toward aggressive, high status, or socially close peers provide additional status boosts. These effects hold regardless of the extent to which status is desired."
0,"People tend to prefer kin support systems for everyday situations and in case of emergency but, with trends toward smaller families and widespread relocation, adult children are not always located near their parents, and those aging parents may need other sources of support. Friends might be able to compensate the lack of family. This paper examines the influence of social structural and psychological measures on the descriptions of “friendship” and the use of friends as support-givers in social networks of people in midlife and later life. Data are from a quantitative sample of 2185 women and men aged 50 to 93 living in Aachen, Germany, a mid-sized city. We further interview 17 women and men in-depth about friendship throughout the life course. Gender, birth cohort and marital status influence the labeling of friends on a descriptive level, but these effects are not robust in mutivariate analyses. Qualitative analyses indicate a connection between the respondent’s definition of friendship and an orientation of the network towards family or friends."
0,"Analyses of neighborhood racial composition in 1980-2000 demonstrate that in multiethnic metropolitan regions there is an emerging pathway of change that leads to relatively stable integration These are ""global neighborhoods"" where Hispanics and Asians are the pioneer integrators of previously all-white zones, later followed by blacks. However, region-wide segregation is maintained at high levels by whites' avoidance of all-minority areas and by their continued exodus (albeit at reduced levels) from mixed settings. Globalization of neighborhoods adds a positive new element of diversity that alters but does not erase the traditional dynamic of minority invasion succession."
0,"Activity theory has served as a theoretical basis for many aging programs. However, researchers focused on activity theory tend to ignore important flaws in its conceptualization. Participant observation was conducted during activities at a nursing home in order to study the application of activity theory. Of particular interest were resident involvement, staff participation, and resident interaction during activities. Observations revealed that activities may not be as beneficial to residents as activity theory suggests. Residents actual participation in activities is minimal. Treatment of residents by staff members was often dehumanizing. Residents rarely interacted with each other. Furthermore, when residents did interact, there were arguments and discourtesy. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed."
0,"Using growth curve modeling techniques, this research investigates whether military spending improved or worsened the economic well-being of citizens within the American states during the post-Vietnam War period. We empirically test the military Keynesianism claim that military spending improves the economic conditions of citizens through its use by politicians as a countercyclical tool to reduce the negative effects of economic downturns. However, due to deindustrialization and the emergence of the ""new military,"" there are reasons to believe that military spending will not effectively improve economic well-being during the post-Vietnam War era. Using longitudinal data we find that states with high levels of military spending are better equipped to stave off the deleterious effects of economic recession than are states with lower levels of military spending."
0,"In this paper we examine data from the Households, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey and the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) to investigate the impact of marital status transitions on domestic labor time. Our aim is to first use HILDA and BHPS to identify the joint influence of unobserved factors on marital status transitions and women’s time on domestic labor; second, to determine whether there is a selection effect into and out of relationships for women who do varying amounts of domestic work; and third, to examine whether these patterns are more widespread by comparison with the UK, a country with broadly similar institutional and cultural features to Australia. A simultaneous-equations model is used to jointly examine the relationships between time on domestic labor and marital status transitions to allow for correlation between unobserved partner and person characteristics that impact on each process. Our results show that women who have higher levels of domesticity when single spend more time on housework after marriage, while women who spend less time on housework when married are more likely to separate. Taken together, these results imply a selection effect of certain kinds of women into and out of relationships."
0,"Latinos are moving beyond traditional areas and settling in new, potentially disorganized destinations. Without an established immigrant community, new destinations appear to rely more on the local religious ecology to regulate community life and to keep crime low. We examine the link between religious ecology and Latino homicide victimization for traditional and new destination counties. We observe four findings. (1) A Catholic presence has no effect on Latino violence in the old and well-organized traditional settlement areas. But in new Latino settlement areas, a Catholic presence substantially lowers violence against Latinos. In contrast, mainline Protestantism is linked to high levels of violence against Latinos in new destinations. (2) Previous claims that Latino communities are safe do not apply to new destinations, where Latinos are murdered at a high rate. (3) Previous claims that areas with high Latino immigration are safe for Latinos are not true for new destinations. (4) New Latino destinations offer little insulation from the effects of economic deprivation on violence. We discuss the implications of the findings."
0,"After the burst of its ""bubble"" economy in 1989, Japan experienced an astonishingly long economic recession whose gravity surpassed any seen in the industrialized world since the 1930s. While this recession is likely to have important consequences on the well-known workplace arrangements and career mobility patterns in that country, systematic analyses of such consequences are nearly absent. This study examines changes in the rates and directions of job mobility in Japan using work history data collected in 2005 from a nationally representative sample of men and women. I find evidence that Japanese firms have largely retained the core elements of the permanent employment system. The norm that stresses men's loyalty to their employers, however, appears to have weakened, resulting in higher voluntary job turnover among male workers. In addition, the gender gap in lifetime mobility processes has narrowed, but not because Japanese women have gained opportunities in the workplace. Rather, economic stagnation has led to greater fluctuations in employment and wages over men's life course, thereby closing the gender gap. Beyond illustrating the changing stratification process in Japan, the findings have general implications for understanding how economic crises impact employment relations, institutional transformations, and social change in advanced industrialized countries.

0,"Investigations of the reception of textual objects have alternately emphasized demographically conditioned patterns of evaluation and taste, or the agency of viewers, readers, and listeners in constructing their own cultural interpretations. In the present article, we advance an empirical and formal analysis of the cultural reception of texts in which interpretations of the multiple dimensions on which a text may be evaluated are transmitted and modified within small groups of individuals in face-to-face contact. We contribute an approach in which the intersection of social structure, individual readings, and interactive group processes all may enter into readers' interpretations of a novel. Our investigation focuses on a set of book clubs for which we collected data on group members' pre- and post-discussion evaluations of a specific book, and the interpersonal influence networks that were formed during the groups' discussions. We analyze these data with a multilevel model of individuals nested in groups, which allows us to address the effects of structure and group dynamics on cultural reception in a single analytic framework."
0,"Growth Coalition Theory has offered promising insight into how growth occurs in urban settings by establishing that place entrepreneurs strive to increase the value of urban place often at odds with use value coalitions of neighborhoods, environmentalists, and preservationalists who oppose such projects.  In this paper a Social Network Analysis methodology is utilized to examine the structure of the growth coalition and its opponents to see if their network positions correspond with the way in which the conflict over a luxury high-rise development project in Lexington, Kentucky unfolded.  The study also makes use of the content of both newspaper articles and the websites of relevant local groups and organizations are analyzed to determine how resources were mobilized in opposition to the growth coalition.  A network is established of 391 local actors and their ties to 24 different organizations prominent in the Lexington area and analyzed using several social networks analysis measures.  The findings of my investigation point to an inability of use-value organizations in Lexington to mobilize adequate resources to combat urban growth.  This leads to a hypothesize that a large part of the inability of local activists to defeat growth coalitions is due to the use-value groups’ relative lack of social cohesion and network actors who have financial resources and ‘access’ to public officials and other local decision makers.  In conclusion, suggestions are made for possible methods to investigate deeper into this subject using existing methods of power structure research complemented by newer Social Network Analysis methods."
0,"When authorities use intimidating or violent tactics to quell nonviolent protest, they can often paradoxically fuel resistance as activists and bystanding publics become indignant at what ap-pears to be an assymetrical and unjust reaction by authorities. Understanding when the paradox of repression is triggered remains a challenge for sociologists. This paper represents our first for-ay into a deeper consideration of repression, including the possibility that both authorities and activists seek to shift the threshold at which the paradox of repression is activated in their favor. State authorities are committed to the use of physical force as a resort to maintain stability and the status quo, but they are also aware that repression may backfire, and thus they employ a range of nonviolent or less-violent “smart repression” methods that aim to demobilize move-ments or help diminish the possibility that more overt repression will not undermine their legiti-macy. We have developed a theoretical continuum of smart repression, and we address active and strategic attempts by movements to manage repression as they also have the ability to shape the cultural field of public expectations and legitimacy where repression is effective or backfires."
0,"Power is a core theoretical construct in the field with amazing utility across substantive areas, levels of analysis and methodologies. Yet, its use along with associated assumptions - assumptions surrounding constraint vs. action and specifically organizational structure and rationality - remain problematic. In this article, and following an overview of important divides on the topic, I develop a dynamic relational theory of power. My framework, which builds on several strands of literature and my own in-depth investigations of workplace discrimination, challenges prevailing top-down conceptions of bureaucratic organizational constraint and rationality (derived from Weber). It also makes explicit the constitutive interplay of structure, culture and action, and provides significant insight into the relational nature of power. Relational, in these regards, entails often-assumed interpersonal interactions but also the capacities of actors to invoke structure (and thus leverage) and legitimate inequality through a two-pronged process of symbolic vilification and amplification. Contemporary bureaucracy and its structural and cultural foundations can provide the leverage for doing so and in a manner whereby hierarchical projects surrounding race, sex, age and social class are systematically reified."
0,"The subjective assessment of personal income, insofar as it reflects or sheds light upon the (potentially different) economic incentive structures facing workers of different demographic groups, has far-reaching implications for public policy and private decision-making alike. This paper explores the impact of personal income on financial satisfaction and on perceived income, focusing on demographic differences across the following groups: white males, black males, white females and black females. The results indicate that different race/gender pairs do respond to income differently. For both financial satisfaction and perceived relative income, white females, black females and black males all have lower returns to personal income than do white males. White males, in other words, appear to reap more ""bang for the buck"" in terms of both of the outcome variables, even after a host of control variables are introduced. The possibility that social comparison among (racial and gender) ingroups is driving the observed demographic differences is discussed. "
0,"Based on an ethnographic study of young adult Jews in a Southern community, this paper examines the behavioral choices made by young adult Jews when enacting their Jewish identities in public settings.  Although few of the subjects of this study have experienced any anti-Jewish behavior expressly directed at them, almost all experience a feeling of unease living in an environment in which a public Christian identity is normative.  This unease is grounded in the historical persecution of Jews (and the never again credo with which many post-Holocaust generation Jews have been raised), and in direct experience with their neighbors and co-workers ignorance about Judaism and Jewish life.  However, as I argue, part of that unease also comes from their hyper-visibility as Jews in a Christian community, and their concerns about whether their own brand of Jewish identity is the right one for their ignorant neighbors to use as a model."
0,"Moving to Opportunity (MTO) offered public housing residents the opportunity to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. Several years later, boys in the experimental group fared no better on measures of risk behavior than their control group counterparts, whereas girls in the experimental group engaged in lower-risk behavior than control group girls. The authors explore these differences by analyzing data from in-depth interviews conducted with 86 teens in Baltimore and Chicago. They find that daily routines, fitting in with neighborhood norms, neighborhood navigation strategies, interactions with peers, friendship making, and distance from father figures may contribute to how girls who moved via MTO benefited more than boys."
0,"Research on residential segregation primarily focuses on the spatial concentration of racial minorities and the poor and the disadvantages associated with this segregation.  Yet, when scholars investigate the residential concentration of gays and lesbians, they often assume that lesbians and gays choose these neighborhoods because of some benefits they provide, whether it is a safe, open space or an area that is more desirable in general because of the amenities it provides to all residents.  Less research, however, quantitatively investigates whether lesbians and gays are concentrated in better areas in terms of neighborhood characteristics and their access to institutional resources like schools and shopping centers.  Drawing upon 2000 U.S. Census and tax parcel data, we use spatial regression to investigate the residential concentration of lesbians and gays in Columbus, Ohio and its relationship to neighborhood characteristics.  Our preliminary findings do not support the hypothesis that gays and lesbians live in more desirable neighborhoods.  Instead, the areas with high concentrations of gay men tend to have small proportions of family households, larger proportions of renters, and fewer malls and shopping centers than other neighborhoods.  Results on lesbian concentration are less clear and require further investigation."
0,"There is an intuitive appeal to the notion that the more lethal the weaponry the more lethal the violence. We explore one aspect of lethal weaponry, firearm accessibility. Using nation-level (N = 168) data from the Small Arms Survey and the World Health Organization's measures of mortality we examine whether rates of small arm ownership have a positive effect on rates of homicide and suicide. Contrary to the opportunity model, the accessibility of firearms does not produce more homicide or suicide when other known factors are controlled for. Consistent with past research, structural factors, like deprivation, explain a large portion of the cross-national variation in homicide and suicide, with some interesting differences between the two models. We discuss explanations for our findings and suggest that firearm accessibility may make some structural positions more lethal."
0,"The ways in which immigrant health profiles change with shifts in acculturation is of increasing interest to scholars and policy makers in the United States, but little is known about the mechanisms that may link acculturation and self-rated health, particularly for Asians. Utilizing the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and its data on foreign-born Latinos (N = 1,199) and Asians (N = 1,323) (Pennell et al. 2004), we investigate and compare the associations between acculturation and self-rated health for immigrants to the United States from six major ethnic subgroups "
0,"To date, no study has examined the mediating effect of child self-esteem on the relationship between parental control and child mental health outcomes at different levels of care. By using data from the Intact Families Study in Toronto (N=888), I propose that: 1) the less controlling and more caring the mother/father, the lower internalizing and externalizing problems of the child; and 2) Self-esteem will have a stronger impact in reducing the effect of maternal/paternal control on child psychological distress in parent-child relationships that are low in care than those that are high in care. My results provide support for both propositions.  With respect to the second proposition, children who have highly caring parents seem to be immune to the effects of parental control. However, children whose parents are low on care are more vulnerable to develop lower self esteem as parental control increases, which then leads to negative mental health outcomes in this group."
0,"Hip hop and hip hop culture are ubiquitous in America.  As the best selling music genre among young adults, this form of expression also raises the ire of the political establishment with lyrics that glamorize drugs, crime, gangs and misogyny.  Simultaneously, hip hop offers an alternative view of life in America articulated by the most silenced, oppressed, and marginalized Americans, Black youth.  However, the myriad of academic writings about hip hop music, fail to examine listeners perceptions of the music.  Guided by critical race theories to give voice to disenfranchised youth, this paper reports Black college students perceptions of hip hop music in general and of existing forms of message rap challenging hegemonic racism. Respondents express considerable ambivalence about hip hop.  They object to lyrics and videos that perpetuate the worst stereotypes of African Americans.  However, respondents also recognize message raps operation as an alternative to mainstream media and a source of empowerment for individuals as it connects the larger Black struggle to their daily lived experiences.  This was particularly true of those who listed message rappers as their favorites and female respondents citing females artists as role models for young Black women."
0,"While extant research has shown that involvement in congregations and conservative religious traditions directly affects educational achievement of Americans, researchers have yet to integrate the religion literature with key findings in the sociology of education on the correlates of educational attainment, such as family size. We investigate the extent to which the negative relation between conservative religious traditions and educational attainment is due to the number of children in conservative religious families. More generally, we investigate how religious tradition affects educational attainment indirectly through family size, and how religious tradition conditions the effect of family size on educational attainment. Analysis of the National Survey of Families and Households shows that negative effects of Catholic upbringing on educational attainment are explained by number of siblings in Catholic families. The results also support the theory that social capital built within evangelical Protestant religious organizations mitigates the negative effect of number of siblings on educational attainment."
0,"Immigrant families bring many resources to the U.S., including their home language. Raising a bilingual child in the United States and maintaining the home language as the child learns English is difficult. This paper is a case study of a multicultural family that has raised a bilingual first grade child and the strategies the parents used to maintain bilingualism. Deliberate language planning, exposure to varied language models, formal bilingual-biliteracy instruction, and fostering emotional ties to the language are key to language maintenance. Upper income familie may have more material resources to foster bilingualism, but social networks among low income families are also key resources for language maintenance."
0,"In 1983, Meredith McGuire addressed the Association of the Sociology of Religion with the hunch that, if we could watch would-be charismatic leaders in the developing states of interaction with their would-be followers, we could see a complete process of power-building (1983: 6).  In a similar vein, Anthony Blasi maintained that charisma is a fundamentally collective, dialectical phenomenon, a moment in our societal conversation (1991: 4).  This paper seeks to demonstrate Max Webers accord with such propositions by showing that implicit within his writings on charisma are tools that can enable a processual understanding of charismatic formation through symbolic interaction.  A corollary of this point is that Webers writings represent an historically crucial turning point in the progression from a Carlylian idea of leaders as inherently powerful to a more social constructionist perspective, and that Webers inspiration for this progression is best understood not through reference to his 19th century forbearers in the social sciences, but rather in his contrast with the very few theological writers (namely Rudolph Sohm and the writers of the New Testament) who had actually employed charisma as a term prior to Webers famous appropriation of it.  A reinterpretation of Webers writings on charisma that gives priority to the social constructionist elements in his thought can provide tools for navigating through many of the interpretational controversies that have plagued charisma research."
0,"Gift exchanges enact status hierarchies when task group members have unspecified levels of social status, but what occurs when exchange partners are not equally ranked? If one gives gifts to her low status counterpart, will a high status actor gain even more influence? Will the low status actor reciprocate these gifts to win back the hypothesized status lost by the high status actors largesse? We use behavior-status and social exchange theories to model a social situation with an exchange and status process. We test hypotheses derived from these theories with empirical evidence gathered from an experimental setting that includes actors in a dyad. The experimental test consists of three parts: an individual task that establishes an ability difference between two actors; a Word Formation Task, during which actors can exchange Scrabble tiles to help each other construct words; and a team task that requires actors to take each others opinions into consideration before making a decision and that also measures influence. One hundred and fifty-one students from a Midwestern state university participated in the experiment. Preliminary results show that when a high status actor gives gifts to a low status partner who cannot reciprocate, the low status partner loses even more influence. These results support the mechanisms of behavior-status theory, but not its assumptions about salience."
0,"Capitalist development in frontier regions presents particular sets of issues to capital and capitalist states. Frontiers regions are by definition situated on the border between regions of effective state control and regions outside of that control.  The development of capitalist modes of production through coercive mechanisms thus remains vulnerable to further outward expansion (exit strategies of frontier labor) while the use of more consensual  forms of capitalist domination is limited by the capacity for capital and states to offer incentives to frontier laborers.  Using comparative-regional and historical methods, the present paper examines the development and consolidation of three difference capitalist modes of production in Colombia: the coffee sector, banana sector, and the coca sector.  The author finds that that the formation of consensual and coercive forms of domination depends upon the capacity for capitalist agencies to negotiate beneficial terms of trade in world markets for the frontier commodities produced."
0,"Extended kin networks are an important social and economic resource in Africa. Existing research has focused primarily on intergenerational ties; much less is known about “lateral” ties, such as those between siblings. In a context of high adult mortality (i.e., fewer grandparents) and falling fertility (i.e., fewer children), sibling relationships may have heightened importance. We use new data from Southern Malawi to examine sibling support during the transition to adulthood. We consider support in two domains: current vs. anticipated support and financial vs. caregiving support. We examine patterns of sibling co-residence across this stage of the life-course, assess the scope and magnitude of economic transfers among sibship sets, and consider perceptions of available support in the case of illness or death. Sibling support is pervasive in this sample, structured by gender and birth-order in ways that privilege laterborn male siblings. We close with some comments on why current and anticipated sibling support may be consequential for marriage and family formation in a variety of cultural contexts."
0,"The last decade of the twentieth century saw the passage of a federal law that completely overhauled the American welfare system, thanks to widespread support for the ""war on welfare"".  Researchers have offered several explanations for this support, including economic self-interest,  beliefs in ""American"" ideal of individualism, and attitudes about African-Americans. Yet few have investigated the role that sexism may have played in support for the welfare system's overhaul.  This paper does just that, using Marxist, radical and difference feminist theories as guide to examine data from the 1996 National Election Study.  Results lend partial support for hypotheses based on all three areas of feminist thought.  Those who are more likely to believe that a return to traditional heterosexual marriage would lead to fewer societal problems, as well as those who are more likely to feel that we are not obligated to care for those in need, are more likely to support welfare reform.  Individualism and attitudes about African-Americans also are found to predict welfare reform views."
0,"As early as the 1920s, studies at various elite colleges revealed that public school graduates outperformed private school graduates academically, and more recent research indicates various differences in life patterns between these two groups 25 years after graduation. The two new studies presented here, which look at attendance at college reunions and donations to one's college, extend that earlier work. At a New England college, public school graduates were more likely than the private school graduates to attend their 30th, 35th, and 40th year college reunions. Donations to the school showed that public school graduates were somewhat more likely to make contributions than private school graduates, and graduates of the most socially elite boarding schools were especially unlikely to have made contributions. These findings are discussed in terms of the varying roles that prep schools and colleges play in one's identity."
0,"Headbanging is a form of dance that is practiced by metal music fans around the world, where participants wildly move their heads back and forth. This uncommon type of behavior that would be unacceptable in most public places becomes a solidarity ritual in metal music concerts. This paper aims to explain this idiosyncratic behavior in public places through Durkheim’s theory of ritual and Collins’ theory of interaction ritual chains. It is argued that headbanging performed in metal music concerts is different from similar rituals performed by religious groups and cults as metal music as a whole lacks an overarching ideology. Instead  of using spiritual experiences to explain this phenomenon, it is argued that headbanging is an interaction ritual chain."
0,"A confining limitation for the occupational sex segregation literature has been the inability to determine how many persons of one sex would have entered an occupation had the other sex not successfully entered instead. Using panel data from all American colleges of veterinary medicine (1976-1995), a fixed-effects model with lagged independent variables finds support for the concurrent effects of many hypothesized feminization mechanisms. Declining relative earnings and policies aimed at increasing production of graduates affect applications from men and women similarly, but feminization is driven by the decline in men's college graduation and their avoidance of fields dominated by women. The findings demonstrate the relative contributions and interdependence of supply and demand to occupational sex composition and the job search process more broadly."
0,"This article combines relational perspectives on gender identity with social network structural perspectives on health to understand men's sexual functioning. The authors argue that network positions that afford independence and control over social resources are consistent with traditional masculine roles and may therefore affect men's sexual performance. For example, when a heterosexual man's female partner has more frequent contact with his confidants than he does which the authors refer to as partner betweenness his relational autonomy, privacy, and control are constrained. Analyses of data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) show that about a quarter of men experience partner betweennessa and that these men are 92% more likely to report erectile dysfunction. Partner betweenness is strongest among the youngest men in the sample, which may reflect changing conceptions of masculinity in later life. The authors consider several explanations for these findings and urge additional research on the links between health, gender, and network structure."
0,"In this paper, we take as a starting point the question of how epidemiologic facts concerning the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) are generated and come to be accepted as real. Using qualitative data from a vignette-based factorial experiment, we find that physicians are engaged in a highly varied process of identifying and interpreting a range of physiologic and non-medical cues from a standardized video vignette as they make decisions for a case of CHD. These diagnostic pathways expose key junctures wherein physicians are detoured to alternative diagnoses, their certainty of CHD lowered, and scientific logic makes it difficult to return to a CHD diagnosis.  Importantly, these processes may help explain observed demographic variations in epidemiologic rates. While social constructionist and labeling theories have long traditions in sociology, these results underscore the importance of their ongoing application to health disparities research."
0,"In the last decade, Americans across the nation have confronted the issue of same-sex marriage, creating a moral discourse that before did not exist.  In this paper I analyze the frames used in debates over constitutional amendments defining marriage and other relationship recognition in newspapers in seven states.  Contrary to previous research on public discussion of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) rights which argues that debates are polarized by values of equal rights vs. traditional morality, I find that American debates on these amendments invoke tolerance, Constitutionality, and separation of powers of the government in addition to equality and traditional morality when confronted with the issue of same-sex marriage.  This research adds to the literature on public discussion of LGBT rights and has broader implications for the role of moral discourse in political culture."
0,"Using tract-level data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census, this study addresses four questions: (1. Has the proportion of neighborhoods with high ethnic concentration changed in from 1990 to 2000? (2. What are the socio-demographic profiles of ethnic neighborhoods? (3. Are new ethnic neighborhoods forming in America's suburbs? (4. How common are ethnoburbs-that is, affluent, suburban, ethnic neighborhoods? For most racial/ethnic groups, the number and share of ethnic neighborhoods grew from 1990 to 2000 and the suburbanization trend was remarkable. Asian neighborhoods as a whole experienced the fastest growth. Ethnoburbs have formed across the country. Although ethnoburbs are more an Asian phenomenon, Hispanic and black ethnoburbs have also developed. These patterns support the segmented assimilation model and the resurgence of ethnicity perspectives."
0,"Why do some individuals accept invitations to participate in protest events while others do not? Using the Citizen Participation Study, the author finds that targets invited by recruiters to whom they are strongly tied are more likely to protest than those invited by weak or absent ties. Such effect, however, is hypothesized to vary across the socioeconomic structure. Although strong ties motivate targets to accept the invitation, only those with sufficient resources could translate motivation into action. Consistent with this hypothesis, while strong ties roughly duplicate the chances of accepting a protest invitation when received by high socioeconomic status (SES) targets, the effectiveness of invitations disappears among low SES targets. This suggests that research about the effects of social networks on protest participation should consider how these networks are embedded in larger socioeconomic structures."
0,"Persistent racial residential segregation is often seen as the result of preferences: whites prefer to live with whites while blacks wish to live near many other blacks. Are these neighborhood preferences color-blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood's residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all-white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African-Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African-Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition."
0,"Large surveys tend to be strong on reliability and generalizability but weak on validity. The recently collected Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort, a large and representative sample of over 10,000 infants assessed at 9 and 24 months, took a provocative step toward trying to improve the validity of measures of infants' environmental conditions. Instead of relying solely on self-reported surveys, the study design employed two additional data collection methods interviewer observations and a videotaped mother/infant interaction. We assess how much additional and unique information about mothering is gained by having this extra data. The percentage of variation in infants' cognitive development we can explain with mothering behaviors doubles when using a multi-method approach versus relying solely on mothers' self-reports. However, our multi-method model of mothering still only explains about two percent of the variation in infants' cognitive development. "
0,"Through a comparison of U.S. receiving locales with similar Mexican immigrant communities but different subnational policies, I seek to advance understanding of the consequences of “attrition through enforcement,” whereby public policy targets undesirable immigrants with the goal of garnering their voluntary exit rather than relying on forced removal.  To this end, the research outlined in this paper tests a key question: Do attrition through enforcement policies at the state and local level affect where immigrants live? In particular, I analyze whether immigrants alter the duration of time they spend in the United States, or change their place of residence in the country due to restrictive policies.  This approach elaborates the link between subnational policy structures and immigrants’ decision-making behavior to stay in the host community or go.  The paper first details the recent history of immigration policy-making at the state and local level and reviews the current debates in the literature.  A description of case selection and methodology precedes a discussion of the study’s findings, which indicate the inefficacy of attrition through enforcement policies at the subnational level.  To conclude, the implications of this analysis are discussed in terms of an emerging research agenda on subnational policies of immigration and integration."
0,"This paper criticizes current research into the digital divide as being mainly descriptive, starting from a too simple criterion of access and lacking a modeling of the consequences of differences in IT access. It presents the outlines of a theoretical model in which a multidimensional concept of access (consisting of motivation, possession, digital skills and use) is introduced and both causes and consequences of differences in IT access are taken into account. Having access to IT  is only one factor that might produce differences in social, cultural and economic outcomes. These outcome are also influenced by the forces that produce differences in IT access in the first place. Distinguishing direct from indirect effects is an important empirical task. As far as empirical research into parts of the model is available, the outcomes of this research are discussed."
0,"Sociologists argue that the organization of social life and the opportunity structures available to members of different status groups result in predictable patterns of risk. Thus, African American women may be vulnerable to stressful events and adverse health outcomes as a result of their distinct social location at the intersection of gender and race. Here, the impact of experiences of gendered racism is examined using survey data from 204 African American women in Black Women in a Study of Epidemics (BWISE). Associations between gendered racism and stressful events across six social roles and contexts (i.e., e.g. social network loss, motherhood, employment and finances, personal injury and accidents, adult victimization, and child victimization) are investigated. Then, the effects of gendered racism and other stressors, including mediating relationships, on four indicators of health (i.e., well-being and life satisfaction, severe anxiety, health concerns, and functional limitation) are compared. Findings suggest that gendered racism is a powerful force in the lives of African American women, operating with and through other stressful events to impact mental and physical health. Implications for theories of social inequality and the stress process are discussed."
0,"Drawing on longitudinal data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999, this study used IRT modeling to operationalize a parental educational investment measure based upon Lareau's notion of 'concerted cultivation.' The analysis used multilevel piecewise growth models regressing children's general knowledge achievement from kindergarten through the first grade on a measure of concerted cultivation and indicators of the family context. The measure of concerted cultivation explained over 30% of the SES gradient and an additional 20-25% of the race/ethnic general know[edge gaps at kindergarten entry after controlling for SES, and was larger than the SES coefficient in magnitude. These findings (a) lend partial support to Lareau's contention that concerted cultivation explains SES learning advantages; (b) contradict the argument that net of SES, concerted cultivation is mostly unrelated to race/ethnic gaps: (c) and raises questions about the importance concerted cultivation for learning disparities after school entry.

0,"Most American and world press have implicitly portrayed the story of the Guggenheim Bilbao as a ""Cinderella"" story in which an American institution and a world-class architectural building come to save a ruinous city, but that's just one side of the story and perhaps not the most important or the most accurate one. In fact, before the museum and Bilbao acquired their current status as a global pilgrimage destination, it was the wealthy Basque government that powered a Guggenheim foundation in financial difficulty at a time when many European cities had already rejected the expansion projects of foundation director Thomas Krens. And it is the success of the Bilbao project that has made possible the beginning of Krens's dream for a global museum franchise, as reflected in the fact that, after Bilbao, numerous cities around the world are actively bidding for a Guggenheim signed by Frank Gehry."
0,"This study explores the relationship between Hispanic enrollment in community colleges and their geographic location. Since the majority of Hispanics in the United States are concentrated in four states (New York, Texas, Florida and California), this study looks into Hispanic attendance at community colleges in these states. Hispanic students who do not reside in one of these four states are significantly more likely to enter the system of higher education through a community college, but not White and Black students. The study suggests the Hispanic reluctance to leave home for college as a possible explanation for their over-representation in community colleges outside these four states."
0,"This article builds on earlier studies that have examined ""the economic cost of homosexuality,"" by using data from the 2000 U.S. Census and by employing multilevel analyses. Our findings indicate that partnered gay men experience a 12.5 percent earnings penalty compared to married heterosexual men, and a statistically insignificant earnings penalty compared to partnered heterosexual men, when both individual- and state-level characteristics are taken into account. Partnered lesbians experience about a 3.5 percent earnings advantage compared to married heterosexual women, and a 9 percent earnings advantage compared to partnered heterosexual women. Although individual-level characteristics are the primary determinants of their earnings, we find that some contextual characteristics affect the earnings of partnered gay men and lesbians, relative to partnered heterosexuals, and that these effects vary by sex."
0,"Drawing on more than five years of extended fieldwork, this article explores the tropes through which dancers express and explain their participation in the Lindy Hop revival. In this reconstruction, the author extends Bourdieu's notions of symbolic power, symbolic violence, and misrecognition to show how racial domination is produced and perpetuated, denigrating and erasing African American cultural identity. As a result, the discourses of the Lindy Hop revival provide a window into understanding how the dominant racial logic of American society circulates even in the most apparently innocuous of cultural practices."
0,"The authors explore the contributions of social and genetic influences to religious attitudes and practices in a population-based sample of 11-18 year olds and their mothers who responded to a Religious Attitudes and Practices Inventory and Religious Rearing Practices Inventory respectively. Contrary to genetic studies examining adult religious behavior, genetic influences were small, accounting for only 10 percent of the variance. Rather, the effects of the social environment were much larger, greater than 50 percent, and a majority of offspring similarity was explained by familial rearing. In light of the divergent finding between adolescents and adults, one supporting a socialization model and the other a genetic model, the importance of integrating genetic and social science methodology for complex social behaviors is discussed."
0,"This research examines type of health insurance coverage among young children within low-income families as a barrier to good health, and as a barrier to general economic well-being at the household level.  Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study, this study uses bivariate and multivariate regression methods to understand how type of health insurance patterns four dependent variables:  1) focal child having a routine place for checkups; 2) focal child being overweight or obese as measured by the BMI; 3) number of emergency room visits focal child experienced in the past 12 months; and 4) the number of days of work mother lost last month due to the sickness of the focal child.  The first three dependent variables explore possible health effects for children due to different types of health insurance coverage.  The fourth dependent variable examines a negative economic spillover of having a sick child on the overall economic well-being of the household.  A parent who loses work due to a sick child may lose income and workplace status.  Three health insurance categories will be used, private health insurance, public health insurance (Medicaid, SCHIP), and no health insurance.   For the multivariate analysis, other variables which may be inter-correlated  such as sex of child, racial-ethnic group of child, age of mother, mothers education, family structure stability, and nativity of the mother  will be used as control variables in the analysis."
0,"Using a sample (N = 1817) of magazine advertisements, this paper examines gender and racial differences in complexion as measured by hair color and skin tone according to a ten-point scale.  The primary finding is that women are systematically depicted in advertisements with lighter hair and skin than are men of the same race (results are analyzed for blacks and whites).  The cause of this differential is interpreted to be gender-specific meanings behind the aesthetic characteristics of lightness and darkness, as well as an overlap with the gender-specific moral standards associated with those meanings."
0,"This paper examines the effect of climate on migration. We examine whether climate is an influential factor in internal migration. We assume that most persons tend to avoid exposure to bitter and cold winters, and excessively hot and humid Summers, preferring climates between these extremes. When engaging in-migration decision-making, therefore, to the extent possible, considerations involving climate are believed to be brought into the calculus. There is a very limited demographic literature on the effects of climate on migration."
0,"Early differences in achievement become compounded through later schooling experiences such as ability grouping and tracking. Research has consistently shown that there are racial differences in student cognitive skills. By the time children enter school, black children trail white children. In this paper, I examine the emergence of the black-white achievement gap using ECLS-B 9 months-preschool data. I examine the role of SES and wealth in explaining racial disparities in early skills. SES and wealth are sources of financial capital which allow parents more resources to provide learning opportunities to their children. I explore the mediating role of wealth and learning opportunities on the relationship between SES and cognitive scores. I find that there are earlier cognitive differences between black and white children with black children at a disadvantage.  SES explains part of the black-white gap and is mediated by wealth and learning opportunities. I find that reading to a child is important for later cognitive scores. Birth characteristics are also key predictors of cognitive scores at 24 months and math scores at 4 years of age.  Overall, I find that examining early child and family characteristics are important for understanding the emergence and persistence of the black-white achievement gap."
0,"This paper presents a multilevel conceptual framework and set of hypotheses about how social capital differences among American families arise and how the differences affect various educational outcomes in the early primary grades. The hypotheses are then assessed with data from a recent national longitudinal sample survey, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey of the 1998-1999 Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Currently-available data from the ECLS-K cover the first two grades of mandatory formal schooling. Social capital is conceptualized in terms of parental involvement in the school, and measured in terms of parents contacts with other parents, and parent attendance at school events. Outcomes examined include cognitive achievement in reading, mathematics, and general knowledge, and teacher ratings of the childs behavior and social skills. The main hypotheses are that levels of social capital are affected by characteristics of families neighborhoods and schools, as well as parental human capital; and that individual and school-aggregate levels of parental social capital will have positive effects on individual students cognitive outcomes and comportment ratings. These hypotheses are assessed with a series of multilevel (student and school) regression models. Results indicate strong effects of parental education, residential stability, perceptions of neighborhood safety, and two-parent households on measures of social capital. Social capital in turn has positive effects on childrens outcomes, but only at the individual level  positive effects of school-aggregate social capital are not detected."
0,"The Red Hat Society (RHS) offers midlife and older women a brief, chosen escape from everyday family, paid, and unpaid work duties. Toying with traditional notions of femininity and aging, the women in this study used a campy performance of gender as embodied in the RHS to both rewrite and reproduce traditional gendered scripts. That is, these midlife and older women enacted elaborate and frivolous alternate feminine identities using their RHS membership as a venue. In doing this, RHS members re-appropriated previously diminishing societal attention and recaptured the heterosexist and ageist male gaze. In their research, the authors found that these older women renegotiated and resisted traditional gender roles through self-defined ""fun"" activities such as going out in public in hyperfeminine dress and engaging in feminine activities such as lunch, tea, and shopping. RHS members are not fading into the woodwork as society expects of aging women, as they publicly take up leisure space, have fun, and engage in personal leisure that only benefits them. This qualitative work, based on research with seventy study participants, twenty-five individual interviews, and four focus groups with forty-five RHS members, suggests that RHS members use the organization as a site of gendered leisure in pursuit of midlife fun."
0,"Heavy weight is negatively associated with test scores at elementary school. Are these negative outcomes due to preexisting differences, or do they represent the casual effect of childhood obesity? To better understand the true consequence, I use a propensity score matching approach to control for biases from observable preexisting differences, and conduct sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of biases from unobserved.  With the data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, I reveal that obese eighth graders have an average loss of 0.17 standard deviations in reading and 0.15 standard deviations in math. The obesity penalty for girls is larger than boys for both reading and math. Differences between obese and normal weight children decline slightly after adjusting for missing values. Findings from sensitivity analyses indicate that unmeasured variables must increase the odds of becoming obese by at least 20% to change the conclusion."
0,"This article examines spatial relationships between environmental hazards (i e., pork feed lots, brick kilns, final assembly plants and a rail line) and markers of social marginality in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Juarez represents an opportunity lot researchers to test for patterns of injustice in a recently urbanizing metropolis of the Global South. We use spatial-econometric modeling to predict the four unique hazard variables and a composite hazard variable using socio-demographic variables at the neighborhood level Lower class and higher percentages of children and migrants were statistically significant predictors of composite hazard density These results align with previous studies in the North. However, disaggregating these results by hazard type reveals important and counterintuitive differences in groups at risk based on the market-orientation of the hazard (i.e., domestic vs transnational) and its location within the urban structure."
0,"This study examines the impacts of intergenerational socioeconomic mobility on self-rated health and functional limitations among senior citizens in China. Based on the cross-sectional data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, this study examines the SES mobility-health association among the old cohort (aged 63-79) and the oldest-old cohort (aged 80-120). Results in this study indicate both similarities and differences between the two cohorts and provide some evidence for the timing model and the change model. Compared to intergenerational residential mobility, intergenerational mobility in education and occupation is a more important predictor of health outcomes among the elders. In addition, self-rated health is more likely to be affected by intergenerational socioeconomic mobility compared to functional limitations. This implies that perceptions of health are more likely to be affected by intergenerational socioeconomic mobility than physical health."
0,"This article discusses the mechanisms that must be in place in order for women to successfully resist institutionalized gender norms. This research draws on over 200hours of observations of and 20 in-depth interviews with women playing full contact football, a sport traditionally dominated by men and firmly planted in the culture of the U.S. as synonymous with masculinity. Following the work of recent calls by gender scholars to treat gender as a social institution, this research shows that at least four components must be in place for sustained, successful resistance to a social institution. First, resistance must be a conscious activity. Second, any resistance must involve engaging in an abnormal activity. Third, any deviant or abnormal activity must take place in an otherwise legitimate social context. Finally, as the creation and maintenance of a social institution is an inherently social enterprise, so, too, is institutional resistance. This research contributes to scholarship on gender and social institutions by showing some strategies for increasing possibilities for personal expression."
0,"The study of organizations and markets suffers from the underdevelopment of disconnected producers. This article emphasizes the imputed identities of sources to argue that difficult-to-categorize outputs were appealing when associated with a source high in disconnectedness. Worldwide data on recordings and mobility with detailed data on Midwest recordings provide evidence that jazz from cities high in disconnectedness was rerecorded more often by musicians over time. Moreover, recordings with difficult-to-categorize elements were more likely to be rerecorded when coming from cities high in disconnectedness, despite evidence that original music was paradoxically less likely to come from these cities."
0,"We examine race differences in delinquency using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We use a new method that permits an examination of offense specialization. We argue that an examination of offense patterns provides an opportunity for testing theoretical explanations of race effects. If race differences in violent crime reflect race differences in serious crime, then theories of crime can explain race effects. Otherwise, theories of violence are needed to explain the phenomenon. Our results suggest that black adolescents have higher rates of violence, particularly armed violence, but they do not have higher rates of serious (or minor) property or drug crime. Race differences in violence are generally stronger for adolescents who would otherwise be at lower risk: girls and adolescents from educated and intact families. Puerto Rican adolescents also have higher rates of violence than Anglos, but other Hispanic groups do not. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of the empirical literature (including our results) for various theoretical explanations of race differences in violence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"According to the modified labeling theory of mental illness, stigma beliefsthe expectation that individuals will devalue and discriminate against psychiatric patientsshould increase patients use of three coping behaviors: concealing treatment history, educating others about mental illness, and withdrawing from social interaction.  Using Interact, a computerized version of affect control theory that simulates social interaction, we examine the way that stigma sentiments (evaluation, potency, and activity associated with the cultural category a mentally ill person) and diagnostic category (adjustment, affective, and schizophrenic) jointly shape the expected use of these behaviors.  As predicted, stigma sentiments increase affective patients expected use of these coping behaviors, but contrary to predictions, stigma sentiments reduce adjustment and schizophrenic patients expected use of these behaviors.  Diagnosis also affects patients coping style: schizophrenic patients are predicted to educate more often than they conceal or withdraw, while adjustment and affective patients are predicted to conceal and withdraw more often than educate.  Also, consistent with predictions, stigma sentiments increase patients expected use of education over secrecy and withdrawal.  However, we also found that diagnostic category shapes the relationship between stigma sentiments and expected use of specific coping behaviors, with the affective patient results matching predictions most closely."
0,"Social psychological research on gendered persistence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions is dominated by two explanations: women leave because they perceive their family plans to be at odds with demands of STEM careers, and women leave due to low self-assessment of their skills in STEM's intellectual tasks, net of their performance. This study uses original panel data to examine behavioral and intentional persistence among students who enter an engineering major in college. Surprisingly, family plans do not contribute to women's attrition during college but are negatively associated with men's intentions to pursue an engineering career. Additionally, math self-assessment does not predict behavioral or intentional persistence once students enroll in a STEM major. This study introduces professional role confidence-individuals' confidence in their ability to successfully fulfill the roles, competencies, and identity features of a profession-and argues that women's lack of this confidence, compared to men, reduces their likelihood of remaining in engineering majors and careers. We find that professional role confidence predicts behavioral and intentional persistence, and that women's relative lack of this confidence contributes to their attrition."
0,"Rising rates of substance use among Hispanic youth, coupled with substantial growth of this minority group, merit grounds for concern. The process of assimilation is frequently examined in studies of Hispanic substance use and has been cited as a reason for higher rates of substance use by U.S.-born Hispanics, compared to their foreign-born peers. However, many previous studies use individual or unidimensional measures of assimilation, when this term is multifaceted. representing different concepts. The current study addresses this gap by testing the longitudinal effect of different assimilation processes (acculturation as well as structural, spatial, and straight-line assimilation), while simultaneously controlling for important familial and social risk and protective factors on the likelihood of alcohol use among U.S.-born Mexican and Mexican immigrant youth. Results indicate that, although alcohol use is higher among immigrant youth, assimilation measures do not predict alcohol use for immigrants or U.S.-born youth. We conclude that the effects of assimilation may vary by person and place. particularly in ethnic enclaves, and suggest the use of measures that incorporate cultural, personal, social, and environmental factors.

0,"In this study we ask in what kinds of markets different types of market identities are most effective. To address this question, we develop a general theoretical framework that emphasizes two factors shaping market identities  audience heterogeneity and within- and between-category competition. We argue that a robust market identity, defined by the presence and interdependence of opposite identity dimensions, is most effective in markets with heterogeneous audiences and between-category competition whereas a distinctive market identity is most effective in markets with homogeneous audiences and between-category competition or markets with heterogeneous audiences and within-category competition. Focusing empirically on robust market identities, we test our framework in the U.S. opera market. Regression analyses of opera repertoires from 1995 to 2005 support our theoretical argument: U.S. opera companies create robust market identities by staging conventional and unconventional operas interdependently depending on the heterogeneity of their audiences and the competitive pressures from other opera companies."
0,"Policy responses to the large influx of Muslim immigrants into Western Europe have become a key site for the assertion, questioning and redefining of the conditions for membership and belonging in these nation-states. In this paper, I develop a framework based on intersectional analysis and theories of ethnic boundary formation to analyze how perceptions of gender, religious, and ethnic difference are mobilized in policy debates concerning immigrant integration. I argue that multiple axes of difference produce representations of immigrants that in turn inform integration policy making practices and the process of boundary formation between immigrant and majority society. I then apply this analytical approach to a Dutch policy proposal and parliamentary debate on the integration of ethnic minority women and girls. I conclude that these particular policy debates turn the subject of the ethnic minority woman into a Muslim woman, as they link gender inequality and religion to ethnicity. This construction of immigrant womens subjectivity creates bright boundaries that lead to assimilationist approaches to immigrant integration. Ultimately, immigrants are encouraged to overcome ethnic distinctions and gender inequality by abandoning their (imputed) religious practices as belonging is defined narrowly according to the practices of the non-immigrant Dutch."
0,"Gender, phenotype, and historical era powerfully shape the life experiences, identities, and cultures of Mexican-origin families. Using interview data fromthree-generation Mexican-American families, second-generation Mexican-American women were inclined to revivify their heritage upon marriage or childbearing whereas men underwent the gendered racialization process of U. S. military service. Among the third generation, skin color determines the relevance or irrelevance of ""symbolic ethnicity."" Women engaged in a ""third-generation return"" to ethnicity far more than men, revealing gendered expectations of cultural transmission. This article advances assimilation theory by identifying fractures within generations-gender, phenotype and historical context-that steer incorporation processes."
0,"This paper is a detailed examination of the conflicting ideas, strategies, and institutional arrangements of a social movement through the lens of its relationship to public and private funders. The specific case explored is the relationship between the Farm Worker Movement, led by Cesar Chavez, and its’ public and private funders. I argue that the seemingly unified vision of Cesar Chavez to build a community union and social movement for farm workers was torn apart through the diverging interests, ideas, and strategies employed by funders and institutions engaged in the movement. Archival research reveals how through relationships with funders, Chavez’ unified theory of social change fractured, separating the social welfare of workers from the economic structures that maintain farmworker poverty and powerlessness –ultimately limiting what the movement could achieve. Most studies of philanthropic cooptation of social movements fail to explain the multi-layered and sometimes contradictory goals and actions of movement leaders and institutions, and their proactive efforts to attract foundation funding. This paper shows how the diverse ideologies, strategies and decisions of movement leadership and institutions complicate unitary theories of philanthropic co-optation."
0,"This talk examines the impact of allied commitments in alleviating secondary marginalization within social movements, specifically the secondary marginalization of transgendered individuals within LGBT politics. This talk analyzes the formation of allied commitments by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual ally (LGBH) activists in order to understand how activists frameworks and boundary formation around transgender inclusion impacts political negotiations over transgender inclusion. Through an analysis of 42 semi-structured interviews with Michigan LGBH activists, this talk establishes the difference between traditional ally identities (such as white anti-racist) and the challenge of allied commitments between dominant and marginal groups within a social movement.  Activists with strong committed allied identities towards transgender inclusion play an active role in advocating for transgender inclusion within the LGBT movement, whereas activists with ambivalent or skeptical commitments often inadvertently perpetuate transgender marginalization."
0,"What motivates compliance with ""toothless"" international human rights norms? This article analyzes the effectiveness of procedures that allow individuals to petition an international human rights body, the Human Rights Committee, alleging state abuse of their treaty-protected rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Using methodological tools that account for selection biases arising from a country's decision to authorize petitions and its subsequent propensity to be targeted by abuse claims, I find that basic civil rights and religious freedoms improved after states were found to have violated their human rights treaty obligations, whereas physical integrity abuses such as disappearances and extrajudicial killing were somewhat more impervious to change. These findings are interpreted with reference to the concept of ""coupling"" as borrowed from organizational sociology, and their implications for treaty design and enforcement are considered. "
0,"Many youth in the United States lack clear occupational aspirations. This uncertainty in achievement ambitions may benefit socio-economic attainment if it signifies ""role exploration,"" characterized by career development, continued education and enduring partnerships. By contrast, uncertainty may diminish attainment if it instead leads to ""aimlessness,"" involving prolonged education without the acquisition of a degree, residential dependence and frequent job changes. We use nationally representative data from the National Education Longitudinal Study to examine how uncertainty in occupational aspirations in adolescence (age 16) affects wage attainments in young adulthood (age 26). Results suggest that youth with undecided career ambitions earn significantly lower hourly wages in young adulthood than youth with more certain aspirations, supporting the view that uncertainty heightens the risk of labor-market problems."
0,"Most theoretical perspectives on neighborhood effects on youth assume that neighborhood context serves as a source of socialization. The exact source v and Processes underlying adolescent socialization in disadvantaged neighborhoods, however: are largely unspecified and unelaborated. This article proposes that cross-cohort socialization by older neighborhood peers is one source of socialization for adolescent boys. Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey suggest that adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to spend time with older individuals. I analyze qualitative interview data from 60 adolescent boys in three neighborhoods in Boston to understand the causes and consequences of these interactions and relationships. Some of the strategies these adolescents employ to cope with violence in disadvantaged neighborhoods promote interaction with older peers, particularly, those who are most disadvantaged. Furthermore, such interactions can expose adolescents to local, unconventional, or alternative cultural models."
0,"A quarter century ago, an important finding in stratification research showed that the intergenerational occupational association was much weaker among college graduates than among those with lower levels of education. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the ""meritocratic power"" of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor's degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor's degree alone."
0,"While the idea that contacts matter in finding a job is intuitively appealing, we still do not know-after decades of research-how and why strong ties benefit job seekers. To resolve this confusion, we need to theorize how specific characteristics of ties are related to the mechanisms that make job search through contacts effective. We have reasons to expect that, while a contact's motivation influences the likelihood that a job seeker receives an offer, her homophily with the job seeker on occupation and other job-relevant attributes influences the quality of the offer. The use of strong ties among university students to find jobs in China provides a unique opportunity to empirically isolate the relationship between contact characteristics and the mechanisms through which contacts benefit the job seeker. I tested my hypotheses with data on both the successful and unsuccessful job searches of 478 graduates of China's flagship universities, who, as first-time job seekers, primarily used strong ties. Survey results are consistent with my hypotheses: job seekers who used strong ties to look for jobs had more offers-but not better offers-than those who used only formal methods. "
0,"Political elites in Bhutan and Thailand promote alternative conceptions to neo-liberal economic goals and projects that claim to be grounded in Buddhist philosophy and principles. As such, these elites tie their efforts to particular conceptions of the cultural and religious heritages of their respective countries. In Bhutan, these efforts are embodied in the concept of Gross National Happiness, while in Thailand they are embodied in the concept of Sufficiency Economy. This paper explores the origins and implications of these concepts, with an emphasis on the manner in which religious ideals are interpreted and deployed by political elites in an attempt to ground political-economic development in particular visions of the good society."
0,"Employing data from the 2002 European Social Survey for 21 national representative samples, we provide the first cross-national analysis of the relations between ethnic composition of neighborhood and perception of neighborhood safety in the European context. The data reveal considerable variation both across countries and across individuals in perceived safety. Bi-level regression analysis shows that perceived safety tends to be lower in countries characterized by a high imprisonment rate and among Europeans who are physically and socially vulnerable (e.g., among women and elderly people, and among populations of low income and low education). Net of individual-level and country-level attributes, the analysis shows that perceived safety is lowest in neighborhoods mostly populated by non-European ethnic minorities and highest in neighborhoods mostly populated by Europeans. The effect of ethnic composition of neighborhood on perceived safety holds even after controlling for previous personal exposure to crime and views toward minorities' impact on crime. We discuss the results in comparison to findings in the United States and in the light of theory in order to delineate the ways that views and perceptions about places are formed and shaped."
0,"Decades of racial progress have led some researchers and policy makers to doubt that discrimination remains an important cause of economic inequality. To study contemporary discrimination, we conducted afield experiment in the low-wage labor market of New York City, recruiting white, black, and Latina job applicants who were matched on demographic characteristics and interpersonal skills. These applicants were given equivalent resumes and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer In fact, black and Latina applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants 'experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers."
0,"We examine how ministers in two religious traditions use discourse on secular visual media as a means of establishing symbolic group boundaries. We compare content in 100 evangelical and mainline Protestant sermons, each of which makes at least one reference to secular cinema. We find that mainline ministers largely promote oexpandingo boundaries with secular culture, that evangelical ministers promote ocontractingo and oexpandingo boundaries in roughly equal measure, and that ministers from both traditions sometimes promote oselectively permeableo boundaries. We explore prevailing frames employed by ministers to promote the respective boundaries, and we discuss implications for studies of culture and religion."
0,"Cultural discourse theory within cultural sociology has been shown to be highly useful in further understanding meaning and action. This paper contributes to this growing body of scholarship by synthesizing the specifically Alexanderian form of discourse analysis with ethnographic perspectives and methods. The analysis examines the Burning Man counterculture, exploring how its participants construct cultural meaning that motivates action. The discourse of the Burning Man counterculture is mapped out and shown to be used by participants to partially challenge mainstream American culture. The participants have varied and sometimes self-contradictory beliefs and behaviors. At times radical and original, at other times mainstream and mundane, they act out a counterculture that both defies and perpetuates dominant American cultural values. The utility of the cultural perspective elaborated within is demonstrated by developing unique understandings of the dynamics of morality, political belief, and constructions of power within this large-scale contemporary counterculture."
0,"This article explores the conditions under which political modernization leads to nation building, to the politicization of ethnic cleavages, or to populism by modeling these three outcomes as more or less encompassing exchange relationships between state elites, counterelites, and the population. Actors seek coalitions that grant them the most advantageous exchange of taxation against public goods and of military support against political participation. Modeling historical data on the distribution of these resources in France and the Ottoman Empire from 1500 to 1900 shows that nation building results from strong state centralization and well-established civil societies; ethnic closure, from weak state capacity and civil societies; and populism, from medium centralization and weak civil societies. The results are consistent with French and Ottoman political histories of the 18th and 19th centuries."
0,"This paper examines the consequences to being “miscategorized” in an ambiguous category. Social objects are often labeled, thereby providing information as to its identity to an external audience. For example, movie titles may communicate what type of movie to expect.  We define an object as being miscategorized when its label contradicts the category to which it is assigned. This miscategorization vis-à-vis an object’s implied category membership should disadvantage it because it will confuse an audience. However, in situations where the category is ambiguous, miscategorized objects purportedly belonging to clearly understood categories may actually be advantaged—both over other objects in that ambiguous category, as well as comparable “correctly” labeled and categorized objects. This occurs for two reasons—first, these objects are more clearly labeled than their peers in the ambiguous category; these clear labels convey more information, resulting in increased appeal compared to the other objects in the ambiguous category. Second, they do not suffer as much competition as their “correctly” categorized peers who vie for attention among a group of similar others. These predictions are confirmed in an online peer to peer lending website, www.prosper.com."
0,"Coercion is a powerful way of organizing collective action.  The self-reinforcing dynamics of coercive mechanisms, such as peer sanctioning or normative enforcement, create strong incentives that produce very high levels of participation.  In the absence of coercive incentives, voluntary collective action can sometime succeed in mobilizing participation, but frequently suffers free riders, who reap the benefits of the collective action without contributing.  I show that although coercively organized systems of collective action may have stronger incentives for participation, and therefore produce greater levels of cooperation than voluntary systems, they have a greater likelihood of failure to due destabilization from accidents, errors and external shocks. Using a threshold model of collective action, similar to previous formal models, I prove that systems of voluntary collective action with free riders have greater long term stability than comparable coercive systems that enjoy stronger incentives and higher levels of cooperation.  This result highlights important features of the micro-macro dynamics in collective action, specifically the surprising consequences of strong individual-level incentives on the stability of the collective action as a whole.  I also demonstrate the significant differences between using discrete time versus continuous time threshold models of collective action, which predict contradictory outcomes and thus make it important to use the more empirically plausible (continuous time) model."
0,"Does social capital-trust and association involvement-predict political consumerism-boycotting and boycotting? Using data from the 2002/2003 European Social Survey we conduct a multilevel logit analysis of 24,854 individuals nested in 228 within-country regions to evaluate whether social capital and political consumerism are positively related at both the individual and regional level. Findings indicate that individuals with greater personal social capital and those who live in regions with higher average levels of social capital are more likely to be political consumers. These results support previous findings that link social capital with other forms of civic engagement."
0,"Data from a random sample of 327 adults in Nizhni Novgorod, Russia, are used to test hypotheses derived from general strain theory concerning the effect of strain on frequency of alcohol use among men and women. The findings lend mixed support to the theory. Although women reported relatively high levels of strain, strained females tended to use alcohol to cope only when in a close relationship with someone who abused alcohol regularly. At the same time, strain was associated with a significant increase in alcohol coping among men, regardless of peer relations. However, for both genders, alcohol-condoning beliefs consistently outperformed strain as a predictor of drinking behavior. No evidence was found of conditional relations involving legitimate coping strategies or deviant beliefs. Contextual and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"Rates of teen pregnancy in the United States are significantly higher than those in most other industrialized nations. This is troubling in light of the consequences to teen mothers, their children, and society. Some suggest that teen pregnancies can be decreased by providing sex education in the public school system, while others believe that sex education is inappropriate for public school. Little research exists, however, on predictors of attitudes toward sex education, and most existing research is dated and lacks a theoretical framework. Guided by the seminal work of Ira L. Reiss, we examine the impact of labor shortages, religiosity, militarism, gender egalitarianism, regulation of sexuality, and a naturalistic view of sexuality on attitudes toward sex education. Results suggest that Hispanics, those with high levels of religiosity, and those who supported regulation of sexuality were significantly less likely to support sex education in public schools. Implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed."
0,"We suggest that new forms of family households, especially same-sex couples and single parents, are likely to face discrimination in their interactions with rental markets. Following the contact hypothesis, we hypothesize that the geographic distribution of discrimination is likely to vary Specifically, in places with more new family households we are likely to find less discrimination against these households. We investigate these issues in the metropolitan area of Vancouver, Canada, through analysis of 1,669 inquiries made about one- and two-bedroom apartments. Using afield experimental design similar to audit studies, we analyze landlord responses to five different two-person household scenarios, including one heterosexual couple, two same-sex couples, and two single parents. Evidence suggests that male same-sex couples, single mothers, and single fathers all face significant discrimination relative to heterosexual couples. The contact hypothesis was supported for male same-sex couples, but not for single parents. This could indicate that single parents are facing discrimination primarily based upon their economic marginalization rather than other forms of prejudice."
0,"Evolutionary theory embodies the sociological critique of economics, and encompasses the traditional twin foci of sociology: the importance of the social in explaining human behavior; and social inequality.  As a metatheory, it has the potential to make sociology the social science of the 21st century.  In this paper I review current sociological literature in a variety areas and show how it can be unified under the general paradigm of evolutionary theory.  As a general paradigm evolutionary theory does not compete with sociological theories but gives ultimate answers as to why the mechanisms sociologists have identified operate as they do."
0,"With a high influx of non-white immigrants after the 1960s, the topic of interracial marriage has become even more important.  However, few researchers have looked at the stability of interracial marriage.  The stability of interracial marriage not only has great implications for mixed children, but can also impact how demographers successfully predict the future racial make-up of society and future patterns of incorporation of the new immigrant groups into American society.  Six panels of SIPP, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996 and 2001, have been stacked together for studying marital dissolution patterns among interracially married couples. On the whole, interracial marriages are less stable.  However, this conclusion depends on the spouses race/ethnicity.  Controlling for the key demographic variables, white/black, white/Hispanic and minority with minority marriages (e.g. black/Hispanic pairings) are less stable than white endogamous marriages.  Citizenship does not seem to be a significant predictor for marital dissolution among interracial couples.  Age of first marriage does not matter as much as age difference between couples.  Age difference between spouses and level of educational achievement are significant predictors for marital dissolution, but difference in level of schooling between the interracial couple is not significant."
0,"Questions of symbolic classification have been central to sociology since its earliest days, given the relevance of distinctions for both affiliation and conflict. Music and its genres are no exception, organizing people and songs within a system of symbolic classification. Numerous studies chronicle the history of specific genres of music, but none document recurrent processes of development and change across musics. In this article, we analyze 60 musics in the United States, delineating between 12 social, organizational, and symbolic attributes. We find four distinct genre types-Avant-garde, Scene-based, Industty-based, and Traditionalist. We also find that these genre types combine to form three distinct trajectories. Two-thirds originate in an Avant-garde genre, and the rest originate as a scene or, to our surprise, in an Industry-based genre. We conclude by discussing a number of questions raised by our findings, including the implications for understanding symbolic classification infields other than music."
0,"Motivated by the growing interest in and the usage of measures of material hardship, together with the lack of a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the how indicators of material hardship relate to one another, we develop and test five conceptual models of the structural coherence of material hardship. While many previous analyses have relied on a unidimensional model of hardship, we argue that this is not conceptually and empirically sufficient. Instead, we compare the standard unidimensional account of hardship to a model that contrasts hardship related to physical necessities and hardship in less critical areas, two models contrasting hardships due to short-term constraints and those with longer time horizons, and finally, a model that posits each nominal type of hardship is best represented by its own latent construct. Using nationally representative data from the 2001 and 2004 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (U. S. Census Bureau 2001, 2004), we estimate confirmatory factor analyses, which suggest that a model of hardship that separates different dimensions-health, food, bill paying, and housing hardship-fits this data better than any of the other conceptual models tested. This finding suggests strongly that the four aspects of material hardship modeled here, though obviously associated, are best understood as arising from processes and structures that are not identical. We discuss implications of our findings for both the research community and policy makers in the conclusion."
0,"Much of the sociology of time has focused on quantitative studies of the number of hours devoted to various activities.  Our paper takes a different approach, looking at one part of the politics of time. We develop a framework for examining contests concerning how many hours employees will engage in paid labor, and especially whether they will work overtime or extended hours.   This process operates at the level of the state through debates over laws and regulations. It operates at the level of the organizationthrough negotiations between employers and unions.  It operates at the level of the worksite, with workers complying or resisting demands from supervisors and co-workers.  And it operates at the level of gender and the family, as spouses and children encourage or discourage workers from putting in additional hours.  We report on preliminary in-depth interviews with nurses, utility maintenance workers, and engineers at one hospital and one nuclear power plant."
0,"The position that people take on moral issues, such as infidelity, can be influenced by abstract principles (e.g., religious ideals) but also by their own relational experience. Conservative religious orientation provides clear moral prescripts about sexual behavior, but what happens when there is perceived strain within one's actual, non-hypothetical relationship? The author tests a series of hypotheses about attitudes towards infidelity using a representative sample of American adults aged 57-85. The results indicate that although most older Americans oppose infidelity in general, distinct differences emerge when the infidelity scenario involves greater moral ambiguity. When dementia is involved, the relational context in which the respondent is embedded emerges as an important predictor variable. Interestingly, each religious group-even born-again Protestants-are susceptible to this moral contingency effect. Results are discussed in relation to Vaisey's (2009) dual-process theory, in which attitudes are shaped by rational and relational factors alike."

With the appointment of William Edward Burghardt Du Bois as director of the investigations in 1897 the unit soon became the first American school of sociology. Unfortunately, the contributions of members of the school beyond Du Bois remain buried within the hundreds of pages of the Atlanta University Publications. This inquiry provides examples of three groups of contributors to the research program at Atlanta Universityprofessionally trained social scientists, citizen researchers, and university students."
0,"In this paper, I address the question of how to comprehend and explain contemporary witch hunts in the tea plantations of India. I aim towards an explanation of what structures the social action of individuals involved in instigating witch hunts. In the course of this explanation, I discuss what social factors lead to the hunts in the plantation and who qualifies as a credible deviant/witch in the community. The paper relies on qualitative methods such as interviews with accused witches, the accusers and victims of witchcraft and data from the police and newspaper archives, to explore how the fear of the scourge of the evil eye leads the entire village to participate in the hunt. Theoretically, the paper frames it arguments from theories of deviant behavior and gender."
0,"In this study we test social disorganization theory of crime using data from a survey of neighborhoods in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, and compare it to theories that emphasize the role of social disorder. We find lower income neighborhoods, including irregular settlements known as favelas, to have higher levels of social cohesion. Contrary to the results of research in U.S. urban areas, we find that higher levels of cohesion among neighborhood residents is not significantly associated with lower levels of crime, and is in fact associated with a higher perceived risk of victimization. By contrast, neighborhood social and physical disorder does increase violent victimization in Brazilian neighborhoods, but does not affect residents perceived risk of being victimized. We argue that the apparent inconsistency between the lack of effect of social cohesion on victimization and its positive effect on perceived risk may be explained by the greater spread of information regarding crimes occurring in more cohesive neighborhoods where residents interact more frequently with each other. We test this proposition by examining the effect of social cohesion on residents knowledge of criminal incidents in the neighborhood. The findings are based on multilevel models where the relation between latent variable constructs such as cohesion, disorder and perceived risk are examined at the aggregate neighborhood level net of the characteristics of individual respondents."
0,"Social scientists typically examine social movements as grassroots phenomena, yet public leaders and elite actors also play important roles. This article examines their role in one contemporary social movement, American evangelicalism. Through semistructured interviews with 360 elite informants, as well as archival and ethnographic research, I explore the mechanisms through which leaders have sought to advance evangelicalism between 1976 and 2006. These public leaders founded organizations, formed networks, exercised convening power and drew on formal and informal positions of authority to achieve movement goals. Results suggest that salient religious identity and cohesive networks have played important roles in shaping the goals and ambitions of leaders within the evangelical movement. Structural coincidence provided by governance structures at evangelical organizations, as well as evangelical programs directed toward elite constituents, have facilitated the formation of overlapping networks across social sectors. Institutional inertia and internal factions, however, have been countervailing forces. This empirical study demonstrates the persistence Of institutional differentiation among America leadership cohort, but it also points to a religious identity that can provide vital, cross-domain cohesion within the structure Of elite power."
0,"This article extends research on the consequences of parental incarceration for child well-being, the effects of mass imprisonment on black-white inequalities in child well-being, and the factors shaping black-white inequalities in infant mortality by considering the relationship between imprisonment and infant mortality, using individual- and state-level data from the United States, 1990 through 2003. Results using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) show that parental incarceration is associated with elevated early infant mortality risk and that partner violence moderates this relationship. Infants of recently incarcerated fathers who are not abusive have twice the mortality risk of other infants, but there is no association if the father was abusive. Results from state-level analyses show a positive association between the imprisonment rate and the total infant mortality rate, black infant mortality rate, and black-white inequality in the infant mortality rate. Assuming a causal effect, results show that had the imprisonment rate remained at its 1990 level, the 2003 infant mortality rate would have been 3.9 percent lower, black-white inequality in the infant mortality rate 8.8 percent lower. Thus, results imply that imprisonment may have health consequences that extend beyond ever-imprisoned men to their social correlates and that these health spillover effects are not limited to infectious disease."

0,"Over the past thirty years, the American abortion debate has been glibly characterized as fight between the rights of two groups: women and fetuses, with pro-choice groups championing the rights of the former and pro-life groups the latter. Yet recently, a growing contingent of the pro-life movement is attempting to alter this dichotomy by using feminist rhetoric to argue that instead of advancing women’s equality, abortion is actually harmful to women. This analysis uses the field frames approach to examine how field level factors affect emergence and effectiveness of pro-woman rhetoric used by this faction of the pro-life movement, and this faction’s ability to shift a field level understanding of the central conflict that makes up the American abortion debate’s field frame. This innovative approach couples more traditional, politically-centric approaches to social change with greater attention to the role of culture. To identify factors contributing to a shift toward women’s rights rhetoric in the pro-life movement over the past 30 years, and how this shift affects a societal level understanding of abortion, I use a combination of focus groups, interviews, participant observation, and content analysis to examine how activists’ strategies, political opportunities, cultural shifts, a diversity of discourse, and actor’s positions vis-à-vis others in the debate affect access to power and other resources, and ultimately, social change."
0,"This study examines whether the mental and physical health of single mothers benefit from marriage or cohabitation compared to childless women who marry. Results indicate that marrying is associated with similar declines in psychological distress for single mothers and childless women, but only when that marriage endures. Single mothers do not receive the same physical health benefits from entering an enduring marriage, in part because single mothers have lower levels of marital quality. Entering and exiting marriage is worse for the mental and physical health of single mothers than for other women and in some cases, worse than remaining unpartnered. Enduring cohabiting unions offer few psychological or physical health benefits to either group but short-lived cohabiting unions are associated with increased distress."

0,"Past research revealed a consistent set of variables related to organizational commitment including work autonomy, supervisor support, relations with co-workers, and satisfaction with compensation and benefits explained via an exchange framework.  In this study, we conceptualize the antecedents of company commitment as resources for control.  Rather than exchanging commitment workers use these resources to gain control over their lives and work.  We examine the impact of these resources across the career stages of workers in a manufacturing plant.  The analysis finds that different resources for control are related to commitment in different career stages based on both age and tenure."
0,"The global diffusion of digital technology, which occurred more rapidly than the global diffusion of any technology previously, has been mired by its uneven distribution across, and unequal effects on, societies worldwide. In addition, policy initiatives to close this global digital divide, which peaked with the two World Summit on Information Society conferences, still did not change the course of this differentiated globalization process. In this article, I attribute the cause of such stalling of policy on the issue of the global digital divide to the bifurcation of current international policy: attention is split between concern for the impeded access of the poor to this revolutionary technology, on the one hand, and the race to lead the world in creating the next ""hot"" technology, on the other. These two concerns, which have been given the pithy titles of the ""global digital divide"" and the ""global innovation divide,"" are leading to two separate policy tracks, targeting the world's laggards and leaders as separate entities and operating under separate logics. This separation is problematic because the issues of access to technology and ownership of rights to technology are intertwined. This article describes the two global technology divides and analyzes the policies that are currently charted to address them."
0,"Recent surveys have found antigay attitudes and behavior to be commonplace. In this article, we use contact theory to explain these prejudicial attitudes. We contribute to the literature on contact and prejudice by expanding contact to include not only whether the heterosexual knows any gay men or lesbians, but also how many, for how long, and in what ways. To these, we add a new and unique measure of contact: a person's contact with the gay community. The data are from a survey of 956 undergraduate students at a large urban university in the southeastern United States. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses find that contact with gay men and lesbians significantly reduces prejudice toward them; although, only as contact with gay friends or the gay community. Contact has stronger effects on women's prejudice than men's prejudice; however, the attitudes of African Americans toward lesbians and gay men are unaffected by gay contact. The results suggest that contact intervenes between prejudice and sex, race, religiosity, and gender attitudes."
0,"In this article I argue that evolutionary theorizing can help sociologists and feminists better understand gender inequality. Evolutionary theory explains why control of the sexuality of young women is a priority across most human societies both past and present. Evolutionary psychology has extended our understanding of male violence against women. Here I add to these theories and present asexual selection argument to postulate possible evolved predispositions that promote young female deference to adult males in interaction and the converse, lack of male deference to young females. According to this argument, the pattern of greater female deference disappears when the women involved are past menopause. Put together, these ideas form an evolutionary account of gender inequality that complements and extends traditional sociological and feminist theories."
0,"Income inequality has grown dramatically over the past thirty years.  As the gap between the richest Americans and the less fortunate has grown, so too have inequalities of political voice.  One important type of political inequality in the United States stems from the system of campaign finance, where rising campaign costs have made money increasingly significant.  Although past research has explored the role of political action committees extensively, little is known about the role of individual contributors, and large, repeat donors in particular.  Using a subset of a large original data set, the Matched Individual Donor Dataset, the present study turns its attention to this critical and increasingly unequal form of political participation.  By following individual donors over time, I present a series of novel analyses that indicate a significant but overlooked mechanism of political influence.  In particular, the pool of donors has grown increasingly concentrated over the 1980-1990 period.  The results also indicate that repeat donors are an identifiable and qualitatively different type of actor in the system of political money.  These elite, repeat donors not only constitute a numerical majority in most elections, but also uniformly contribute the lion’s share of money accruing to federal candidates and national party committees.  Moreover, these elite donors’ giving patterns differ dramatically that of one-time contributors."
0,"Previous research into the social distribution of early life depression has yielded inconsistent results regarding the causes and course of subgroup depression disparities. This study examines the topic by analyzing National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data, modeling gender and racial/ethnic differences in early life depression trajectories and investigating the influences of stress and socioeconomic status. Results indicate females and minorities experience elevated depressive symptoms across early life compared to males and whites. SES and stressful life events explain much of the racial/ethnic disparities. Blacks, Hispanics and females show greater sensitivity to the effects of low SES, and in the case of females, SLEs. Overall, this study develops a nuanced, dynamic model of the multiplicative effects of social disadvantage on early life depression disparities."
0,"Some social movements thrive and others fizzle out and are unable to formalize themselves.  In trying to understand what causes some movements to survive and others to fail, social movement researchers have traditionally focused on resource mobilization and political process models.  In contrast to those who find narration to be too subjective to be useful, I contend that narration is instrumental in understanding social movement mobilization, participation, and sustenance.  In this case, I define narration as written or oral testimonies about experiences that motivated participants to join the movement and experiences of being a part of the movement.  In this article, I explore the narrative of movement participants in the U.S. Central America peace movement.  I examine the narration by movement participants about the formation and maintenance of four organizations included as part of the U.S. Central America peace movement: the Sanctuary movement, Witness for Peace, Pledge of Resistance, and SOA Watch.  I found that in these four sites, narrative of experience has played a key role in forming a collective identity amongst movement participants and fostered an appeal to the moral sensibility of people to participate in the movement.  This exploratory research emphasizes the importance of exploring narration further in future social movement research."
0,"Although there has been a recent surge of new research on status, much debate about how best to understand and define status persists.  We work toward greater conceptual clarity by comparing and contrasting status with several cognate concepts: quality, reputation, brand, power, legitimacy, and purity.  These comparisons and contrasts bring us to a provisional definition of status as a zero-sum intangible asset possessed by social actors insofar as they are highly regarded by highly-regarded others.  We close by drawing a distinction between soft status (based on deference to a focal actor) and hard status (based on dominance by a focal actor).  Implications for future research are discussed."
0,"The main purpose of this paper is to draw attention to conflicts of interest as a fascinating phenomenon in its own right, from an empirical as well as an analytical point of view. A conflict of interest, it is suggested, can be defined as a situation in which there is an actor for whom a private interest threatens to overtake a public interest. To fully understand the clash between these two interests you need to go beyond a pure interest analysis and approach the situation with a sociological perspective. The empirical part of the paper consists of an analysis of the conflicts of interest that are associated with the recent financial scandals of corporations such as Enron and WorldCom. The public interest that was at stake in these events was that of the small investor; and the precarious situation of small investors in the U.S. is presented. Two types of conflicts of interest are analyzed: those in the world of accounting (with Arthur Andersen as the case study) and those in investment banking (with Merrill Lynch as the case study). A conflict of interest, the paper ends, can also be seen as a distinct social mechanism, similar to a constitutional device such as separation of power."
0,"Systemic discrimination persists in the nations housing markets, though it has become more subtle in recent years.   While several discriminatory practices have been uncovered, virtually no attention has been given to bias that may be occurring simply because of a familys name.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that different levels of service are provided to homeseekers who have names that are traditionally associated with white, black, or Latino individuals but it is unclear how systematic such practices are.  A growing number of homeseekers are now utilizing on-line services where housing providers initial responses are based strictly on the shoppers names.  This study will constitute the first scientific investigation of such name discrimination in the nations housing markets. In this proposal we discuss the importance of this research, its relation to previous investigations, the methodology we will utilize to study this phenomenon, and potentially critical policy implications."
0,"Working-class mobilization has been neither the sole nor a necessary factor for welfare state formation in advanced industrial countries, yet in all others the working classes did mobilize for a welfare state (independent of their degrees of success), and hence the question of the failure of the US working classes to do so calls for explanation. This paper weighs historical-sociological, political-cultural and state-structural explanations of workers failure to mobilize politically for a redistributive welfare state in the US. It finds that working-class consciousness did not develop strongly in the US, both because individual, ethnic and religious identities were most often stronger than class identities (and capitalist elites were effective at manipulating these identity-based divisions), and because class identities per se were antithetical to US political culture. Moreover, not only was working-class consciousness weak; attempts at political engagement for redistributive goals were impeded by formidable institutional mobilization hurdles. For these reasons, US workers only rarely and weakly fought for social citizenship rights or redistribution, and when they did, lacked the strength to overcome mobilization hurdles. Instead, they supported non-redistributive elite policies aimed at the welfare goals of securing individual economic opportunity (through low taxes, weak labor and environmental regulation and aggressive foreign economic policy), individual self-sufficiency (through high rates of labor-market participation und denial of aid to the undeserving poor), decent living standards for the deserving poor (through homesteads, Aid to Dependent Children, EITC), and retirement security (through Veterans Pensions, Social Security and Medicare)."
0,"Cross-national research on voluntary association involvement have shown clear differences in the likelihood that citizens of different countries participate. Many studies have stressed the importance of contemporaneous contextual differences, such as national wealth, political regimes, and religious traditions. We extend this research by introducing models that assess generational differences that have been discussed in the literature. More specifically, we evaluate hypotheses concerning a) the role of religious socialization, b) the role of television exposure, c) the role of war time experience, d) the impact of the length of exposure to communist rule, and e) the importance of aggregate levels of educational attainment. To test our hypotheses, we use multilevel analysis techniques on a concatenated dataset from 11 international surveys consisting over 200,000 individuals from 56 countries. Results show strong cohort effects. People who grew up in a devout society, without much exposure to television, without much war experience or exposure to a Communist regime, and among lower educated peers are more likely to participate in voluntary associations."
0,"Universities often promote their diversity as a selling point, but are students of different races at these universities integrated socially? Using Social Energy Theory developed by Mayhew et al. (1995), I examine racial segregation among university students at a case study university. Using quantitative data on where students live and eat as well as interviews with 25 students, I find that students are substantially more segregated than chance predicts. Blacks and Hispanics are particularly segregated. Interviews reveal that these students spend large amounts of social energy coping with prejudice and discrimination as well as functioning in a student culture they find unwelcoming and foreign; these energy drains reduce energy left for interracial interaction, making these racial groups more segregated. The study highlights the need for understanding segregation as a function of the interaction of out-group preferences, in-group preferences, and the larger social context."
0,"Sociology is concerned with a number of social processes that take place in and around the household – including the division of labor, socialization, exchanges of support, and social interaction – but it typically ignores the physical space within which these processes occur. Drawing inspiration from sociological models of neighborhoods, I propose a new approach to the study of the household context in which social and physical features of the household are viewed as interrelated and mutually constituted. To illustrate this, I explore how social relationships may contribute to the emergence of a set of conditions that I refer to as household physical disorder, and how household physical disorder may affect social relationships. I use data from two waves of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based study of older adults, to test these ideas. Cross-lagged panel models reveal that household physical disorder is a result of both socioeconomic and social resources such as support from family members. I also find that household physical disorder has consequences for social networks. I conclude by urging more careful attention to how the household physical environment may shape -- and be shaped by -- the social interactions and processes that occur within it."
0,"This paper presents a model of the meaning of parenting as described by parents who have adopted children out of the foster care system. The parenting role is divided into three levels, beginning with the executive duties of availability, monitoring, problem solving and management. The means of parenting are authority and communication, and the end of parenting is to produce an independent adult through teaching and taking care of the child physically and emotionally. The implications of this model for symbolic interactionist family theory is discussed, as is the social construction of parents as the primary causal agents in their children's lives."
0,"Drawing from close to four years of ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and video recordings, this paper analyzes how inner-city men sustain playful street corner rap ""battles"" in South Central Los Angeles. Although participants know that the battle is supposed to be a playful way of resolving perceived disrespect in group rap ""ciphers,"" some become "" more than play."" Indeed, ritual insults have the power to provoke feelings of rage, which can propel individuals into violence. To sustain the playful meanings of battles, participants who offend their opponent use different nonverbal cues to signal, "" I was just playing,"" while the offended party responds with cues signaling, "" I do not have any hard feelings."" When these moves do not work, onlookers step in between participants, tell jokes, and use other gestures to defuse escalating tensions. The techniques outlined in this article elaborate Erving Goffman's (1974) theories of "" keys"" and "" limits,"" showing how embodied and emotional cues are used to sustain the shared presumption that "" this is play."""
0,"In this paper, I use the findings from my qualitative research into partner abuse in female same-sex relationships to shed light upon some of the complexities of womens definitions of abuse in same-sex intimate relationships.  Forty women took part in semi-structured, in-depth interviews, in one of the first qualitative studies of violence and abuse in female same-sex relationships in the United Kingdom.  Whilst all of these women self-identified as having been abused in a previous same-sex relationship, there were cases where a certain act was defined as abusive by some participants, but where a similar act in similar circumstances was not defined as abusive by other participants.  This paper examines some of the ways in which women define abuse in intimate relationships, and the factors which contribute to how women form decisions about these definitions.  The ways in which women minimize and normalize abuse is explored, in addition to womens views of the relevance of the labels of victim and perpetrator to their experiences.  The findings which I share indicate that the boundaries of violence and abuse in intimate relationships have the potential to be much more ambiguous and blurry than widely held dichotomies of violent/non-violent, innocent/guilty and victim/perpetrator imply, calling for a more textured analysis of violence and abuse in all types of intimate relationships."
0,"This article develops the concept of food justice, which places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies. Through comparative ethnographic case studies, we analyze the demands for food justice articulated by the Karuk Tribe of California and the West Oakland Food Collaborative. Activists in these communities use an environmental justice frame to address access to healthy food, advocating for a local food system in West Oakland, and for the demolition of Klamath River dams that prevent subsistence fishing. Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and environmental justice. This concept brings the environmental justice emphasis on racially stratified access to environmental benefits to bear on the sustainable agriculture movement's attention to the processes of food production and consumption. Furthermore, we argue that the concept of food justice can help the environmental justice movement move beyond several limitations of their frequent place-based approach and the sustainable agriculture movement to more meaningfully incorporate issues of equity and social justice. Additionally, food justice may help activists and policymakers working on food security to understand the institutionalized nature of denied access to healthy food."
0,"In this study, the goal is to review and personalize the self-development of gays and lesbians as informed by the principles, practices, and politics of the Christian church. Data were collected through individual interviews with 11 persons of the gay and lesbian community, ranging from working-class economic status to the upper-class economic status, undergraduate college-educated to post-graduate educated, and from white to black in terms of racial identity. Findings included (1) negative perceptions of the institutional Church vis-à-vis theology; (2) the pain of having to make spiritual and sexual identities partners rather adversaries; (3) positive feelings around the idea of the Church as community; and (4) general themes of anger and pain, yet hope and opportunity for unconditional acceptance. In light of the stories collected, it is underscored that the onus needs to shift from those gay and lesbian individuals, who are expected to adjust to the culture of the church, to the church, which needs to investigate programs and ministries that benefit an increasingly diverse congregation, including gay and lesbian individuals—out and closeted."
0,"Agnew's general strain theory (GST) and Gottfredson and Hirschi's self-control theory represent significant theoretical developments in sociology of deviance over the last two decades. Both theories offer unique insights into the well-known controversy of gender disparity in crime and delinquency. Incorporating their ideas and testing them in a Chinese context, this study investigates the role of self-control, which has been seldom included in GST assessments, in moderating the strain-delinquency relationship and analyzes whether this conditioning effect varies by gender. Using data from 1,015 Chinese students in Hong Kong, negative binominal regression models found that self-control is a gender-specific conditioning factor of strain. Self-control mitigates the effects of certain strains on delinquency for females only. Yet, unexpectedly, coercive parenting decreases male delinquency and moderates the impact of low self-control in males. The implications of Chinese cultural forces for the perception of strain and the conditioning influence of self-control merit closer attention."
0,"The sociological literature on collective memory is characterized by two paradoxical positions.  The first, derived from the work of George Herbert Mead, argues that the past is constantly redefined from the standpoint of the present.  The second, with its origins in the writings of Emile Durkheim, contends that social solidarity is based upon collective memory, which contributes to the persistence of cultural arrangements by resisting efforts to redefine the past.  We can assess the relative merits of these theoretical positions by examining the Vatican’s decision, in 1969, to remove more than 200 saints from its liturgical calendar (e.g., St. Christopher, St. Barbara, St. Lucy, St. Ursula, St. Catherine, St. Valentine, St. Nicholas, St. George, St. Vitus, and St. Patrick) -- in effect, demoting their sacred status due to a lack of historical evidence for their existence or acts coupled with a desire to make room for saints from non-European origins."
0,"This study combines longitudinal individual-level data with neighborhood-level industrial hazard data to examine the extent and sources of environmental inequality. Results indicate that profound racial and ethnic differences in proximity to industrial pollution persist when differences in individual education, household income, and other microlevel characteristics are controlled. Examination of underlying migration patterns further reveals that black and Latino householders move into neighborhoods with significantly higher hazard levels than do comparable whites and that racial differences in proximity to neighborhood pollution are maintained more by these disparate mobility destinations than by differential effects of pollution on the decision to move."
0,"What is the best way to design tournaments for status, where individuals labor primarily for the esteem of their peers?  We propose a formal model of status-based competition that contrasts two competing alternatives. The first, following Merton (1968), is the Matthew Effect, according to which a tournaments architect directs excess resources to elite actors, and thus widens the distribution of rewards by favoring cumulative advantage.  The second is the Mark Effect, under which a tournaments designer instead pushes excess resources to marginal actors, and thus tightens the distribution of rewards through engaging in redistribution.  Our results indicate that the Mark Effect is better for the social welfare of most tournaments, but that the Matthew Effect is preferable for elite tournaments, such as top R&D labs, that rank highly against other tournaments.  Our main contributions are twofold: We find that, counter to the thrust of Mertons (1968) work, cumulative advantage is not invariably optimal for the functioning of status contests; and we identify circumstances in which the production of superstars is likely to make contests for status better off in aggregate.  An empirical extension using panel data on levels of selectivity and faculty salary dispersion of colleges and universities in California is presented."
0,"The attainment of economic independence is a key marker of the contemporary transition to adulthood.  In this study we ask, how do young adults gain the capacity to support themselves and how do they acquire confidence in being able to manage their finances?  We examine this process objectively, in terms of the capacity to pay for regular living expenses; as well as subjectively, by considering young adults self-reported ability to deal with their financial problems and their sense of control over their financial situations.  Findings from the Youth Development Study, a 15-year panel study, indicate that the family economic climate experienced during adolescence influences these objective and subjective components of economic independence.  The familys impacts on economic self-sufficiency occur through the development of a sense of efficacy in the economic sphere during adolescence and through early adult income attainment."
0,"This paper explores the enactment of economic knowledge in the context of policy making. It examines how economic information is differently embodied in the analysis of data, the posing of alternative policies, the negotiation of group decision making and in the signaling of its results to stakeholders. It shows how economic knowledge, though ritualized in its various contexts, is also performed differently by staff economists, policymakers, and by leaders. Verbatim transcripts of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central policy making unit of the Federal Reserve, are used to explore how situation shapes the uses and meaning of economic knowledge among elite policy makers."
0,"Using in-depth interviews with forty infertile women and 363 responses to a web survey for infertile women, I explore how womens relationships have changed because of their infertility, and what impact this has on the self.  Specifically I explore how infertile women cope with negative social support given by people close to them.  Infertility not only prevents the infertile woman from achieving her goals, it also prevents the significant people in her life from achieving theirs.  She is expected to become a mother.  Failing to meet this expectation affects her relationships. Previous research suggests that infertility should affect the womans relationship, which should then affect the self.  This is a reactive model.  This paper suggests that infertile women are more active than that.  Rather than suffer the damage to the self negative support might cause, the women in this study are not passive objects subject only to the influences of others.  Many women in this study reconstructed their relationships and networks in order to minimize the impact on the self that receiving negative social support might cause."
0,"The development of satellite technology during the Cold War resulted in an international framework that would benefit United States political interests regarding satellites in general and reconnaissance satellites in particular.  This paper examines the strategies used to minimize publicity of military interests by promoting scientific interests for the benefit of all humanity. Through operating as the authority over technological knowledge, the state uses technology in order to maintain its position of exclusive control as opposed to a mechanism for shared knowledge and full public participation.  This is exemplified through the development of the legal framework for surveillance satellites during the Cold War and is maintained in the contemporary of commercial space operations through regulatory and legal mechanisms."
0,"Understanding human development at the international, regional, and national level is essential to the understanding of the needs and wants of vast populations around the world.  Since the late 1980s that had been the goal of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  The program has published hundreds of reports at each of the above levels.  However, development reports at the national level tend to be reserved for areas of crisis, such as civil war, famine, etc.  Because of this and the lack of current literature on the subject little is know about human development in the United States.  This project aims to apply the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) to the United States in order to create a sub-national HDI for the measurement of U.S. counties.  Due to the inherent spatial methodology in the development of the HDI, this project further introduces the use of geographic information systems tools in hopes of better capturing the results of the development index.  The results show a very interesting picture of high regional, state, and county variation in all of the measures and outcomes associated with the implementation of the sub-national HDI."
0,"Alliance building across social movement groups is an important aspect of social movement dynamics, contributing to their viability and capacity to promote social change. Yet, with few exceptions, cross-movement coalitions have received little sustained theoretical or empirical attention. This article contributes to an understanding of cross-movement coalition building through the examination of a successful case of alliance: a coalition of environmental justice and peace and anti-weapons proliferation groups to stop a federally funded U. S. biodefense laboratory from being built and operated in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Cross-movement collaboration was challenged by tensions arising from differences in positionality. Positional differences reflect status distinctions such as race, class, gender, and place and the differential experiences and expectations that result. Nonetheless, this coalition was able to resolve positional tensions and, as a result, remained a viable protest vehicle. We found this was accomplished through a cross-movement bridging process that involved (1) cause affirmation, (2) strategic deployment, (3) exclusion, and (4) co-development of cross-movement commitments. We extend existent accounts of cross-movement coalition by providing both a culturally founded and fine-grained account of coalition work in the maintenance of alliance relations. The article and its conclusions also address the broader implications of understanding successful trans-positional cross-movement alliances."
0,"Drawing from extensive fieldwork and document analysis, we examine environmental illness claims in Oklahoma's Tar Creek basin, one of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) premier Superfund sites. Our findings indicate that contested illness in the Tar Creek Superfund site differed from typical cases in that the links between high lead exposures and permanent neurological damage were thoroughly and unequivocally documented. But, despite the certainty of these linkages, residents remained embroiled in controversy and they encountered obstacles in obtaining diagnoses, treatment, and compensation. The resultant environmental dispute took two forms: conflict between residents and EPA officials over the adequacy of the agency's remediation project and conflict among residents over ultimate responsibility for children's lead exposures and consequent learning disabilities."
0,"This paper offers a meta-analysis that traces the contested meaning and use of social capital in sociological research over the last 18 years by focusing on journal article definitions. We identify six common definitions in use that closely correspond to the original-and in some cases, independent-formulations offered by Hanifan, Putnam, Coleman, Bourdieu, and Granovetter. Drawing from Kuhnian theory, we contend that these definitions illuminate deep divisions between those who understand social capital as a normative ""cure-all"" (Portes 1998) -in the tradition of Hanifan, Putnam, and Coleman -and those who view it as a resource -in the tradition of Bourdieu and Granovetter that may be used to create or maintain social inequality. The transition of social capital from preparadigm to paradigm status may potentially involve an integration of these approaches, but this will require greater consideration of power and inequality on the part of normative theorists, who are currently dominating the debate."
0,"Consistent with the hypothesis that heightened visibility and competition lead to greater economic discrimination against minorities, countless studies have observed a negative association between minority population concentration and minority socioeconomic attainment. But minorities who reside in areas with high minority concentration are likely to differ from minorities who reside in areas with few minorities on unobserved characteristics related to economic attainment. Thus, this association may be a product of differential skills, behaviors and networks acquired during childhood or of selective migration. Applying fixed-effects models to a quarter century of panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we find that for Blacks and Latinos the inverse association between minority population concentration and earnings is eliminated when unobserved person-specific characteristics are controlled. The findings suggest that the negative association between Black population size and Blacks' earnings is driven largely by the selection of high-earning Blacks into labor markets with relatively small Black populations. Most of the association between Latino population concentration and earnings is attributable to the level of Latino population concentration experienced during childhood."
0,"The relative income or income status hypothesis implies that people should be happier when they live among the poor. Findings on neighborhood effects suggest, however, that living in a poorer neighborhood reduces, not enhances, a person's happiness. Using data from the American National Election Study linked to income data from the U.S. census, the authors find that Americans tend to be happier when they reside in richer neighborhoods (consistent with neighborhood studies) in poorer counties (as predicted by the relative income hypothesis). Thus it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor, as long as the poor do not live too close."
0,"Having an unintended birth is associated with maternal and child health outcomes, the mother-child relationship, and subsequent fertility. Unintended fertility likely also increases the risk of union dissolution for parents, but it is unclear whether this association derives from a causal effect or selection processes and whether it differs by union type. This article uses data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth to compare union stability after intended and unintended births in coresidential relationships. Results show that coresidential couples are more likely to break up after an unintended first or higher-order birth than after an intended first or higher-order birth, even when accounting for stable unobserved characteristics using fixed-effects models. The negative association is stronger for marriages than cohabitations, despite the overall higher dissolution rate of cohabiting unions. We conclude that unintended fertility at any parity is disruptive for coresidential couples in ways that increase the risk of union dissolution. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 15,355), this article examines the relationship between adolescent embeddedness and substance use. Unlike most previous work on substance use, the authors focus on the size of an individual's social network (embeddedness) instead of the characteristics of individuals in that network. They examine four levels of embeddedness (isolated, marginal, typical, and saturated) and the variation in their link to substance use, specifically alcohol consumption, binge drinking, cigarette smoking, and marijuana smoking. Students with high in-school embeddedness were significantly more likely to participate in risk behaviors involving alcohol while students with no in-school embeddedness are protected from risk behaviors by their social isolation. The study then argues for future research in substance use and peer effects that explores the interplay between measures of social capital and embeddedness."
0,"The author examines how characteristics of evacuation management and FEMA trailer park communities affect hurricane evacuees' physical health. His objectives are (1) to examine to what extent typical factors influence physical health in post-disaster contexts, (2) to identify factors specific to the evacuation process and residential environment that exacerbate physical health, and (3) to expand the theoretical applicability of the stress process model by analyzing physical health under disaster conditions. Using survey data collected from 303 evacuees residing in FEMA trailer parks in Louisiana, the author estimates three nested regression models. Conditions of the evacuation process-loss of full-time employment, number of residences, and duration of residences, and FEMA trailer park environment-and sense of belonging and obstacles to involvement affect physical health when controlling for typical factors, indicating social support and social integration buffer the stress of residential instability. Findings necessitate attention to residential stability, social integration, and community involvement in disaster recovery."
0,"This article evaluates social movement perspectives on repression and movement-countermovement organization relative to the wave of policy setbacks that unions experienced in the pivotal two decades following the New Deal. An event history analysis of the adoption of right-to-work laws across states between 1944 and 1960 supports social movement perspectives that emphasize the relative threat posed by challenging groups, but the impact of threat is uneven. The findings advance a more contextualized and historically grounded understanding, demonstrating how union threat takes on greater meaning in contexts where authorities side with employers relative to labor. This study improves upon prior labor scholarship by including data on both union and employer organization, each of which are shown to be influential for right-to-work outcomes independent of notable political opportunities. I conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for scholarship on labor and social movements more generally."
0,"Occupations are central to the stratification systems of industrial countries, but they have played little role in empirical attempts to explain the well-documented increase in wage inequality that occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. We address this deficiency by assessing occupation-level effects on wage inequality using data from the Current Population Survey for 1983 through 2008. We model the mean and variance of wages for each occupation, controlling for education and demographic factors at the individual level to test three competing explanations for the increase in wage inequality: (1) the growth of between-occupation polarization, (2) changes in education and labor force composition, and (3) residual inequality unaccounted for by occupations and demographic characteristics. After correcting for a problem with imputed data that biased Kim and Sakamoto's (2008) results, we find that between-occupation changes explain 66 percent of the increase in wage inequality from 1992 to 2008, although 23 percent of this is due to the switch to the 2000 occupation codes in 2003. Sensitivity analysis reveals that 18 percent of the increase in inequality from 1983 to 2002 is due to changes in just three occupations: managers ''not elsewhere classified,'' secretaries, and computer systems analysts."
0,"Science policy has in the past two decades been increasingly dominated by a market-oriented discourse which links knowledge production to the achievement of national economic competitiveness. A variety of new funding programs have been implemented to bring science into alignment with economic goals through the implementation of new evaluation processes and criteria. In this paper, I explore how basic scientists construct and reconstruct their scientific identities and practices in relation to this politically-imposed market-oriented vision of science. Using interview data and curriculum vitae collected from basic scientists engaged in health-related research in an elite Canadian research university, I will describe patterns of identity change and discuss whether these point towards the conservation of the traditional discovery-oriented regime of knowledge production, towards a new market-oriented or Mode 2 knowledge regime, or towards the construction of a ‘contradictory knowledge regime’ in which market-oriented and discovery-oriented logics exist side-by-side in a state of ongoing tension."
0,"This paper explores the construction of history through the shaping of popular memory, or preferred memories.  Empirical data from interviews with 7 people involved in historic and cultural preservation in the US South is analyzed in order to explore how people manage history in light of present needs and understandings. Through memory, history becomes an important site to create and negotiate meaning as well as the site of utopian desire (how we wish to remember ourselves in the present). Heritage Organizations create a usable past through attempting to position themselves as victims. This is accomplished through a discourse of embattlement, which makes culture a surrogate for race, thus leaving whiteness unexamined and unchallenged. Thus, popular memory and culture are revealed as strategies for managing white identity."
0,"Observers of higher education in the USA today agree that one of our most serious concerns is the overuse and misuse of part-time faculty, sometimes called adjuncts, lecturers, or simply part-timers. We call them PTFs. One concern is the weakening of the full-time faculty, the traditional backbone of Academia. But our concern involves the lives and careers of these PTFs. And more specifically, how they feel about it. Given the usual absence of job security, the relatively meager pay, the sense of second-class academic citizenship, plus myriad day-to-day annoyances associated with PT status, it would seem logical to infer that they are highly alienated. Classic Marxist theory is based on this assumption of a direct link between an objective condition of exploitation and this psycho-social state. However, attempts to empirically establish and measure alienation have frequently failed to prove its presence. This research, based on focus groups and a survey of PTFs at Cal State Hayward, attempts to break alienation into its possible components. Some components do show job dissatisfaction. But overall, the data show rather high levels of job satisfaction. Similar research done elsewhere also shows a surprisingly high degree of satisfaction."
0,"Homophily promotes the development of social relationships within social groups and increases segregation across groups. Although prior research has demonstrated that network segregation operates in many dimensions such as race and gender, sexual orientation has received little attention. This study investigates what accounts for the segregation between gay, lesbian and bisexual friends and straight friends in GLB youth's personal networks by testing three possible underlying mechanisms - structural constraints, choice homophily and compartmentalization attempts. The analysis uses data collected from GLB youth who were becoming members of a community organization in Indiana from 1994 through 1998. Although the small, convenience sample does not allow generalization of the results, the rich network data provide important insights into personal network segregation in this unique social context. The results suggest that the segregation between GLB and straight friends result from structural constraints and friends' preference to interact within their groups, and that the focal GLB youth's effort to compartmentalize his or her sexual identity accounts little for the segregation."
0,"A substantial body of research has explored the extent to which the race of offenders and victims influences who receives a death sentence for capital crimes. Little is known about how race and ethnicity might pattern death-row outcomes. Drawing upon evidence from male offenders sentenced to death in Texas during the years 1974 through 2009, we extend recent research by examining whether the race and ethnicity of offenders and victims and a number of offender, victim, and crime attributes influence the likelihood of executions and sentence relief (whereby prisoners leave death row). Cox regression analyses are used in conjunction with a multiple-imputation method for handling a modest amount of missing data. The results show that cases involving minorities-with black or Latino offenders or victims-have lower hazards of execution than cases in which both offenders and victims are white. Victim and offender race and ethnicity have little to no independent effect upon the hazard of sentence relief. Keywords: capital punishment, executions, sentence relief, race, Latinos."
0,"This article adopts an institutional approach to describe the changing secondary market for life insurance in the United States. Since the 1990s, this market, in which investors buy strangers' life insurance policies, has grown in the face of considerable moral ambivalence. The author uses news reports and interviews to identify and describe three conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation, and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within economic sociology."
0,"Andreski (1954) assessed the impact of military power on social structure, introducing the concept of the Military Participation Ratio (MPR), or the proportion of the general population in military service. In the transition from labor-intensive to capital-intensive military operations, researchers tend to overlook the continuing significance of the MPR, arguing that the mobilization of human resources is no longer an adequate measure to evaluate the military power of a state. In the age of a small professional force, we argue that the MPR specifies the extent of the institutional presence of the military in society, capturing the dynamics between the military and the labor market. In order to adequately capture the militarys institutional presence, we contend that it is necessary to distinguish among the shifting roles of active as well as reserve components, civilian employees of the armed forces, and defense contractors. Having done so, we can offer a more complete and telling story of the transformation of the American military over the last century. What stands out in this story of change then is the tremendous increase in importance of the reserve components since the end of the Cold War."
0,"This paper explores the impact of eugenics, a social movement spearheaded by an elite group of scientists, philanthropists, and lawyers who mobilized to ‘improve the national stock’ and prevent the ‘unfit’ from reproducing in the early twentieth century United States. I designate eugenics as a professional social movement that functioned like the public interest groups of the early twentieth century (McCarthy and Zald, 1973; Clemens, 1997). While eugenics did not realize all of its goals of societal transformation and largely fell from popularity after the Holocaust, the movement nevertheless had important consequences on American history. I examine the mobilization activities of two primary eugenic organizations, the Eugenic Record Office and the American Eugenics Society, the efforts of which enabled eugenicists to make coercive sterilization a desirable approach to population control among many states. Eugenicists were responsible for bringing the issue of coercive sterilization legislation before the Supreme Court in the 1927 landmark case Buck v. Bell, where the Court deemed the compulsory sterilization of ‘feebleminded’ Carrie Buck constitutional. Following this decision, coercive sterilization legislation spread around the nation and tens of thousands of Americans were sterilized against their will."
0,"We examine the manner in which voluntary associations expose individuals to differing perspectives, or ""cross-talk."" Specifically we develop hypotheses based on the interactive roles of elite bias and homophily in structuring networks of democratic participation and test them on social network data of Los Angeles neighborhood councils. We find that homophily leads to boards less diverse than their communities, but does not lead to homogeneous cliques within boards. Moreover, we find that elite bias and homophily counteract each other in lower-status communities, leading to more diverse boards than would be predicted by homophily alone. We then examine the effects of assortative mixing on political attitudes and collective action, and find weak support for the proposition that associational diversity promotes tolerance and access to information."
0,"The foreclosure crisis of the Great Recession (2007-2009) has presented American homeowners with a diverse array of options for dealing with a mortgage they can no longer afford.  These options include strategic default, voluntary foreclosure, deed-in-lieu, short sale and loan modification, among others. Drawing on data from 45 in-depth interviews and over 500 hours of ethnographic research with homeowners in trouble in the greater San Jose metropolitan area, I find that social location influences the salience of particular norms and as a result, the approach that individuals take when dealing with foreclosure.  I identify three such approaches: commiserating with fellow travellers, impersonal and anonymous information gathering, and contacting experts with influence. These approaches are associated with the working class, middle class, and upper class, respectively.  Importantly, the social location within which each class is situated, rather than class cultures, make each approach normatively desirable and feasible.  In the discussion, I put forward a theory of how norms reflect social location. This theory explains why the actions of the middle class, but not the working and upper classes, were guided by shame.  The middle class belief that the cause of their troubles was personal financial irresponsibility, rather than market forces, and the resulting isolation from their social network, made commiserating with others or contacting experts with influence unlikely."
0,"How do social movements influence corporations? Recent work suggests that movements can inflict material damage on their targets and shape categories of evaluation in organizational fields. Extending these ideas, we examine the effects of anti-sweatshop campaigns on sales, stock performance, reputation and specialized ratings of U. S. firms, using fixed-effects regression models and event study methods. The analysis demonstrates that social movements can in some circumstances shape both the markets and fields that firms inhabit. Specifically, anti-sweatshop campaigns (1. had negative effects on sales (though only among certain types of firms), (2. influenced stock prices, and (3. shaped specialized ratings of corporate responsibility. They also diminished previously positive corporate reputations (to a modest degree) but did not radically alter reputational hierarchies in the business community."
0,"Social networks are ubiquitous in social and economic life. Networks act as conduits of resources such as status and information. While our knowledge about the kinds of network ties used for carrying different types of resources, especially information, has grown considerably, we know very little about when actors choose to rely on the information carried by network ties. Here we outline a theory and empirically study how context affects the choice of actors to rely on the information from their social networks. Using data from the English East India Company’s shipping network, we find that the captains were more likely to rely on information carried by social network ties early in their careers but less so later as their own experience grew. Likewise, the level of autonomy enjoyed by the actors has a positive effect on their reliance on network information. Environmental uncertainty also increases the importance of the timely information carried by networks. When the diversity of information carried by networks increases, we find that personal experience becomes increasingly important in deciding what course to take. Our theory and results contribute to our understanding of the role of networks economic and social life."
0,"Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this paper explores the extent to which residing in ""non-traditional"" sibling compositions (i.e., living with step- and/or half-siblings) explains the relationship between academic disadvantage and stepfamily living. Net of demographic and family background characteristics, ""non-traditional"" sibling compositions are associated with lower grades and higher levels of school-related behavior problems. The disadvantage associated with ""non-traditional"" siblings accumulates or remains constant over time as family members live together. Controlling for sibling composition mediates the lowered outcomes of youth in married stepfamilies and explains a portion of the disadvantage experienced by those in cohabiting stepfamilies. Thus, part of what makes stepfamily life detrimental to the academic outcomes of youth appears to be the complexity, ambiguity and stress that comes with having ""non-traditional"" siblings living within the same home. These results confirm the importance of considering the composition of a young person's entire residential family unit, rather than focusing exclusively on the structure of parent-child relations, when studying adolescent academic outcomes.

0,"We analyzed the nature of sociological social psychology as reflected in the pages of Social Psychology Quarterly (SPQ), 1975-2005.  We examined 1,037 papers published in SPQ during the 31-year time period.  We analyzed trends in format, authorship, and research methods.  We used cited reference searching to determine SPQ's top authors, top institutions, and most influential papers, as well as the top journals citing SPQ.  We conclude that sociological social psychology has strength in diversity, but may face some challenges ahead."
0,"Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, I compare the academic attitudes of high school students from Generation X and the Millennial Generation. I then analyze the effects these attitudes have on mathematics achievement test scores. Compared to the earlier group, students in the later cohort were less likely to indicate academic reasons for attending school and largely perceived their friends as being less engaged academically. Students in both cohorts whose friends held academic values experienced an increase in math scores. The more students in the earlier cohort disagreed that they came to school for academic reasons, the more their math scores decreased; this relationship did not appear for the later cohort. Females in each cohort showed stronger academic attitudes than males; additionally, believing that popularity was important was associated with lower test scores for females, but not males, in the Millennial cohort.

0,"The 1989 velvet revolution in Czechoslovakia exposed massive environmental degradation associated with the Communist regime’s unregulated industrialization.  Favorable political conditions following the revolution facilitated the rapid growth and development of a nascent environmental movement, yet growing inflation and conservative political shifts contributed to the rapid contraction of political opportunities for environmentalists during the 1990s.  We use the case of the Czech environmental movement to explore how shifting political opportunities fundamentally altered the political landscape for environmental activists.  We draw upon a unique dataset on the Czech environmental movement collected over a ten-year span, between 2000 and 2009.  Findings indicate that shifting external pressures not only resulted in contracted opportunities for environmentalists, but they also spurred internal debates and dissension over professionalization and tactical repertoires within the environmental movement.  We conclude by highlighting the need for future research on environmental activism in democratizing nations."
0,"The development of conceptual frameworks for the analysis of social exclusion has somewhat out-stripped related methodological developments. This paper seeks to contribute to filling this gap through the application of self-organising maps (SOMs) to the analysis of a detailed set of material deprivation indicators relating to the Irish case. The SOM approach allows us to offer a differentiated and interpretable picture of the structure of multiple deprivation in contemporary Ireland. Employing this approach, we identify 16 clusters characterised by distinct profiles across 42 deprivation indicators. Exploratory analyses demonstrate that, controlling for equivalised household income, SOM cluster membership adds substantially to our ability to predict subjective economic stress. Moreover, in comparison with an analogous latent class approach, the SOM analysis offers considerable additional discriminatory power in relation to individuals' experience of their economic circumstances. The results suggest that the SOM approach could prove a valuable addition to a 'methodological platform' for analysing the shape and form of social exclusion. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Using the American Community Survey from 2005 to 2007, this study investigates absolute and relative poverty among Asian-Americans. The results indicate that both absolute and relative poverty are slightly higher among Asians than among whites overall as well as by nativity status (i.e., foreign born vs. native born). More detailed analysis suggests, however, that these racial differences appear to be largely associated with factors relating to immigration. Poverty is much higher among recent immigrants than among those who have been in the United States for more than five years, and foreign-born Asians are more likely to be recent immigrants than are foreign-born whites. Furthermore, after controlling for basic demographic characteristics, poverty is actually lower among foreign-born Asians than among foreign-born whites. Among native-born adult Asians (i.e., those who are not dependent on the incomes of immigrant parents), poverty is lower than among whites especially in terms of being characterized as members of the ""working poor."" However, significant ethnic differentials within the Asian category are evident. Poverty rates higher than those for whites continue to be evident among the native-born adult offspring of Cambodians, Hmong, and Thai. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"In 1996 Walmart established its first retail store in China. Since then it has grown to 71 retail outlets in 34 cities throughout the country, employing over 36,000 workers. China has for over a decade been Walmarts foremost supplier of manufactured goods, importing products from subcontracted factories employing the sweated labor of young migrant women. It is now poised to become Chinas largest retailer, with a bid to purchase Trustmart, a Taiwanese retail chain with 200 stores in China. As it faces restrictions on growth in the U.S., Walmart is taking its everyday low prices on the road, eyeing China as its next major retail market. Walmart has especially focused its expansion in Chinas western regions, where economic growth has been relatively slow.  This paper examines the effects on employees of multiple strategies used by the retailer to minimize labor costs and maximize efficiency. The paper is based upon participant observation research conducted in a Walmart retail outlet in Kunming, a southwestern Chinese city that is host to four Walmart stores. Two major strategies will be explored for their impact on the retail shopfloor labor regime. First I examine the externalization of labor supply in two forms: the use of vendors as a source of shopfloor sales labor and the use of a cleaning agency for its custodial services. Second, I investigate the rationalization and perpetual speed-up of cashiering among workers directly employed by the retailer. The paper argues that the use of surveillance and information technology replaces the direct observation of managers as a tactic of despotic control. In this labor regime customers are unwittingly recruited to partake in the direct control of employees. Work on the Walmart retail shopfloor takes on the cast of an assembly-line."
0,"This study conducts a systematic age, period, and cohort analysis that provides new evidence of the dynamics of and heterogeneity in, subjective well-being across the life course and over time in the United States. I use recently developed methodologies of hierarchical age-period-cohort models, and the longest available population data series on happiness from the General Social Survey, 1972 to 2004. I find distinct life-course patterns, time trends, and birth cohort changes in happiness. The age effects are strong and indicate increases in happiness over the life course. Period effects show first decreasing and then increasing trends in happiness. Baby-boomer cohorts report lower levels of happiness, suggesting the influence of early life conditions and formative experiences. I also find substantial life-course and period variations in social disparities in happiness. The results show convergences in sex, race, and educational gaps in happiness with age, which can largely be attributed to differential exposure to various social conditions important to happiness, such as marital status and health. Sex and race inequalities in happiness declined in the long term over the past 30 years. During the most recent decade, however the net sex difference disappeared while the racial gap in happiness remained substantial."
0,"Typically the relationship between civic engagement and religion has been investigated using only basic measures of religious attendance or denomination. We utilize more detailed indicators of various types of religious participation and a more valid concept of religious traditions to examine the influence on civic engagement, finding that typical measures of religious attendance or denomination camouflage much of religion's influence. We show that while several religious traditions are positively related to civic engagement, being an Evangelical Protestant or Black Protestant is negatively related. The results also indicate that religious attendance reduces overall civic engagement, while other types of religious participation increase civic engagement. At the specific levels of civic engagement such as belong, contribute, volunteer, and lead, we find similar variations in religious traditions and types of religious participation. Our findings suggest that scholars often overlooked the importance of religious participation beyond religious attendance and reached conclusions regarding civic engagement that do not accurately describe religion's effects. Thus, we contend that attendance and religious tradition, while they may be important and should be included in analysis, should not be the sole, or even primary, focus."
0,"In depth interviews with 246 whites between the ages of 25-55 in three areas of the country regarding attitudes toward racial and economic inequality reveal a close link between religious identity and conservative political attitudes for both working and middle class interviewees. By comparing the attitudes of religious conservatives with nonreligious conservatives on those policy issues that were especially affected by the Civil Rights Movement (schools, welfare, the inner city), we show that religious conservatives use moral rhetoric and a framework of the strict father (i.e. tough love, self reliance) more so than nonreligious conservatives to attack public institutions that extended citizenship rights to blacks as part of the Civil Rights Movement, even though religious conservatives do not differ from nonreligious conservatives in the expression of support for the principles of the Civil Rights Movement itself (that blacks deserve the same rights and opportunities as everyone else). That is, while support for civil rights in the abstract has become normative in the country, racial politics are being played out instead through moral rhetoric that attacks public institutions and public policies that are intended to protect civil rights. Overall the analysis shows that the link between religion and politics in the post-Civil Rights period is not just an expression of values. Rather, racial politics shapes the particular interpretation of religious values as mandating political conservatism and anti-government rhetoric, then religious rhetoric further encourages and supports conservative politics, with the effect of challenging the outcomes of the Civil Rights Movement."
0,"This research investigates one process through which deviance becomes legitimate and therefore expected of individuals within a group. On the one hand, the status Of an individual initially suggesting deviance affects others' personal beliefs that deviance is proper, and in turn the likelihood that they will enact and transmit deviance to new group members. On the other hand, endorsement of deviance by peers is sufficient to legitimate the behavior. As a result, individuals are more likely to enact and transmit endorsed deviance regardless of propriety. Results of a laboratory experiment, in which a confederate suggests that participants should cheat on a task, indicate that endorsement and status independently affect the likelihood participants cheated and suggested cheating to a new group, but that they do not interact."
0,"Studies suggest that students who participate in extracurricular activities benefit in a number of ways. However, schools provide different opportunities to participate in these activities. Using information from high school yearbooks and administrative data on students and schools in North Carolina, we examine whether school characteristics influence the numbers and types of extracurricular activities available, whether schools providing more and diverse activities have higher participation rates, and whether these schools have better academic outcomes. We find that school size and poverty levels significantly influence the number and types of activities available, with larger schools and those schools with more affluent student bodies offering more activities. In addition, schools with more activities available tend to have higher participation rates. Opportunities to participate are associated with positive academic outcomes for the school, even when controlling for school resources. For some-but not all-activities, student participation rates mediate the relationship between activity availability and the school's academic profile. For benefits to be present, schools must provide these resources, and students must invest in them. "
0,"Are African Americans prospects for mobility into managerial, professional, and executive occupations in the public sector declining pursuant to the growing privatization of work conditions in this sector?  Analyses with a Panel Study of Income Dynamics sample of males indicate that the increasingly discretion-based employment practices associated with the new business model of work organization serves to disadvantage African Americans, relative to Whites. Specifically, substantially greater racial parity in the incidence, determinants, and timing of mobility achieved by African Americans, relative to Whites, in the public than the private sector during the pre-reform period  (1985-1990) eroded during the reform period (2002-2007) primarily because of growing inequities in the public sector. The implications of these results for explaining emerging patterns of racial inequality in the American labor market are discussed."
0,"This paper expands upon earlier research concerning methodological issues with interracial exposure and isolation (p*) indices. The earlier research, based on the fifty largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States, showed that due to skewness in the distribution of neighborhood racial compositions, these indices often overstate the degree of racial diversity in the neighborhoods of most individuals. That research showed that in the fifty largest metropolitan areas, a new measure, the median exposure or isolation index (p* -md), provided a result more representative of the situation of most individuals. This paper expands the earlier research to include all U.S. metropolitan areas. Focusing on white exposure to African Americans, it is shown that in most metropolitan areas, the majority of whites live in areas significantly whiter than indicated by the p* measure used in past studies. Moreover, the more segregated an area is, the more p* understates the degree to which African Americans are excluded from most whites' neighborhoods. Several implications of this finding for race relations are discussed. It is concluded that p*-md provides a more accurate picture than p* of the neighborhood racial composition of most white individuals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"While the general dynamics governing collective memory processes are well developed theoretically, our tool kit for systematically assessing how collective memory changes over time remains limited. Here, we focus on a particular tragic event the killing of five participants in an anti-KKK march in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Nov. 3, 1979 to assess continuity and change across accounts presented as part of a 1980 federally-sponsored investigation and a 2005 truth and reconciliation commission. Specifically, we employ a block modeling methodology to describe the structure of narrative themes shared across multiple accounts in each time period. We then analyze the sources of temporal variation in these narratives, and show how shifts in the range of actors participating in the 1980 and 2005 initiatives, as well as the institutional contexts within which accounts were offered, shaped how themes were strategically deployed to increase the resonance of specific positions. We find that, in the Greensboro case, the contours of these demographic and institutional dimensions resulted in a decrease in the polarization of competing narratives and an increased emphasis on key themes that contested elite ""institutional"" accounts."
0,"This study examines the racial and religious differences in parental attitudes toward interfaith relationships in the Bible Belt region of the United States. Using data from the 2007 Georgia Southwestern Omnibus Community Survey, we explore attitudes toward interfaith unions and whether opposition becomes stronger as the union becomes more intimate. We utilize marriage market theory and third party influence to explain subjective parental attitudes toward the interfaith unions of their children. We employ a tolerance scale and logistic regression to predict the racial, religious, and cultural differences in opposition toward interfaith friendship, dating, and marriage. Results indicate that religious importance is a more significant predictor of interfaith opposition than religious affiliation. In addition, white parents exhibit greater opposition toward interfaith dating and marriage than black parents. Overall, the level of opposition toward interfaith unions increases as the relationship becomes more intimate."
0,"Several studies have analyzed the impact of obesity on occupational standing. This study extends previous research by estimating the influence of body mass on occupational attainment over three decades of the career using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. In a series of covariance structure analyses, we considered three mechanisms that may alter the career trajectories of heavy individuals: (1. employment-based discrimination, (2. educational attainment, and (3. marriage market processes. Unlike previous studies, we found limited evidence that employment-based discrimination impaired the career trajectories of either men or women. Instead, we found that heavy women received less post-secondary schooling than their thinner peers, which in turn adversely affected their occupational standing at each point in their careers."
0,"Many existing studies have demonstrated the earnings disadvantage of immigrants in U.S. labor market. When examining the mechanism of such disadvantage, previous research has pointed to the factor of lower human capital as a portion of immigrants completed their education before immigration. This study builds on the previous research and further investigates both place of college and where they completed education on the earnings among immigrant scientists and engineers. In addition to the human capital, this study captures factors pertaining to acculturation. Using data from Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), I divide the immigrant scientists and engineers into fully foreign-educated, fully U.S.-educated and mixed foreign- and U.S.-educated groups. These categories are regressed against the native-born in a full sample and subsamples of men and women, respectively. The full-sample analysis shows that immigrant scientists and engineers who have received their college education abroad are at an earnings disadvantage, regardless of whether they completed their higher degrees in or outside the United States. However, their earnings can rise faster than their native-born peers if they completed their education in the United States. The results suggest that attending college and/or pre-college in U.S. plays a more substantial role in closing the earnings gap between immigrants and non-immigrants among scientists and engineers. Gender-specific analyses reveal that the earnings gap between immigrants and native-born women is narrower than that between their male counterparts, showing gender may play a more salient role in earnings disadvantage than immigrant status.

0,"In an ideal world, schools would provide students with a safe environment conducive to learning.  However, every type of school is touched by crime and/or fear in some way.  Students perceptions of safety have implications for their learning process.  Situations that are defined as real have real consequences, and fear takes focus away from learning. The school may not be able to control external factors, but the school can control its own school climate, which may increase perceptions of safety.  This study examines the relationship between sense of community and perceptions of safety in eighth and tenth grade using NELS:88.  The results indicate that when students feel that they have interpersonal relationships with teachers they are more likely to feel safe in school net of personal incidents of crime and school behavioral environment in both eighth and tenth grade.  In tenth grade the racial composition of the school matters for perceptions of safety, with black students being less likely to feel safe as the percent of white students increases. The findings of this study can help schools to create environments where students feel safe, allowing the students to focus their attention on academics rather than fear."

0,"We used multilevel covariance structure analysis to study the relationship between birth weight, family context and youth math and reading comprehension growth from approximately ages 5 through 14 within and between families. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Sample, we examined the relationship between birth weight and subsequent academic achievement growth disparities, distinguishing between birth weight and other contextual social confounders. We found that smaller birth weight is associated with lower math and reading scores at age 5. Additional findings indicated that the home environment has important developmental consequences from early childhood and into adolescence. Overall, the pattern of findings painted a complex picture of disadvantage, beginning in the womb and extending through a variety of mechanisms into adolescence."
0,"This article takes a new approach to gender and housework by identifying a new measure of gender deviance-work in gender-typical occupations-and by arguing that men who do ""women's work"" and women who do ""men's work"" in the labor market may seek to neutralize their gender deviance by doing male-and female-typed work at home. Analysis of data from the National Survey of Families and Households and the 2003-7 waves of the American Time Use Survey shows that men who do ""women's work"" in the market spend more time on male-typed housework relative to men in gender-balanced occupations and their wives spend more time on female-typed housework. Women in gender-atypical occupations also do more female-typed housework than women in gender-balanced occupations. The article provides clearer evidence about the important ways in which cultural conceptions of gender shape and are shaped by economic processes."
0,"Over the past century the United States has experienced substantial population-wide gains in educational attainment - increases driven largely by processes of cohort succession Focusing on the adult population age 25-54 we show that there has been (1) a significant attenuation of the historical increases in educational attainment and (2) a shift in the processes underlying educational change that differs by gender Our analysis points to a significant turning point in population-wide educational levels, and from a research perspective has implications for how one interprets findings when using education as a control variable "
0,"Many men say that they feel increasingly hampered as they age. Social theories that specify relations between abstract concepts agency/determinism, domination/resistance, and consent/coercion tend to advocate on behalf of particular social groups whom they present as oppressed but having agency with which they resist their oppression. Ordinary people draw some of the same moral lines, between their senses of disempowerment and their acts of defiance, for instance. Discussion of their aging bodies provides professional, middle-aged men a venue in which they discuss the extent to which they wish to strive to live up to ideals of young adulthood. Data for the study of the relation between institutional and personal formulations of masculine agency include professional discourses of refereed social science and social work journals, and personal/institutional discourses offered by interviews with men in the 40s and 50s about their experiences of their aging bodies. Men variously report retaining their senses of efficacy, relying increasingly on the external agencies of routines and commodities for assistance, and slacking off into states of relative lack of empowerment/discipline. The latter approach stands to frustrate the institutions that wish, for their own reasons, to see older men empowered."
0,"Previous research has found a link between economic development and post-materialist and libertarian values. This research examines social change in values in Japan from the mid-1970s to the beginning of the 21st century. Using Japanese survey data, we investigate the nature and pace of social change during the economic crisis of the early 1990s, as well as in the periods before and after the burst of the bubble economy. We find that social change stalled during the economic crisis and resumed again in the late 1990s, but at a much lower level than in the late 1980s. We argue that economic period effects are largely responsible for the slowdown in social change in values in Japan at the end of the 20th century. "

0,"We use newly developed methods of measuring spatial segregation across a range of spatial scales to assess changes in racial residential segregation patterns in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2000. Our results point to three notable trends in segregation from 1990 to 2000: ( I) Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation levels increased at both micro- and macro-scales; (2) black-white segregation declined at a micro-scale, but was unchanged at a macro-scale; and (3) for all three racial groups and for almost all metropolitan areas, macro-scale segregation accounted for more of the total metropolitan area segregation in 2000 than in 1990. Our examination of the variation in these trends among the metropolitan areas suggests that Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation changes have been driven largely by increases in macro-scale segregation resulting from the rapid growth of the Hispanic and Asian populations in central cities. The changes in black-white segregation, in contrast, appear to be driven by the continuation of a 30-year trend in declining micro-segregation, coupled with persistent and largely stable patterns of macro-segregation.

0,"Some scholars suggest that church strength inhibits the rise of liberation theology while church weakness facilitates its emergence.  This article argues just the opposite.  Drawing on research on state strength, this article argues that strong churches, that is, those that are relatively autonomous and with a well developed capacity to carry out social programs are more likely to develop along liberationist lines.  Conversely, weak churches, that is, those that lack autonomy or capacity or both are less likely to develop along liberationist lines.  A typology of Latin American Catholicism is developed and the argument is applied to the cases of Chile, Columbia, Mexico and Venezuela."
0,"In the United States, gender-neutral cocustody policies provide parents equal legal and physical custody of children post-divorce/separation and recast the family as nonhierarchical and as expressing an egalitarian ideal.  But what happens in practice?  Interviews with 31 cocustodial parents in California reveal the abstraction of cocustody law is quite different than the day-to-day reality of coparenting.  In spite of the rhetorical reorientation of cocustodial family law the majority of coparents in these interviews suggest cocustody policies impact parents differently.  Coparenting legal status can be a powerful impetus to parent equally post-relationship and a great back up for fathers struggling with masculinist discourses often at odds with hands-on parenting, however, coparents reveal there is little about the practice of cocustody that is gender-neutral, particularly: the process of mediation; the history of child care; and, who receives social support."
0,"This paper focuses on a different, often neglected, aspect of the globalization of education, the expansion of fundamentalist beliefs and educational institutions across the world. Evidence and theory suggesting a worldwide isomorphic convergence of a single educational script is compared with that of the divergence approach highlighting fundamentalism, and fundamentalist schools, as an exemplar to challenges modernist world-culture brings to religious beliefs and practices. International data from Chile, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Russia, Sweden, and the US, is analyzed to investigate the validity of the two images of globalization of education proposed by the two approaches. Results suggest the need for a more dynamic model that would capture the process of negotiation between local beliefs and particular social contexts, with global pressures."
0,"Existing research rarely examines the social consequences of poor childhood health from a longitudinal perspective Using data from the British National Child Development Study, I follow a cohort from before birth through middle age to examine whether children s health limitations before and during the educational process predict occupational skill in mid-adulthood, and whether negative consequences are strongest for children in persistently poor health I also examine whether differences in achievement explain the observed associations, and at what point during the schooling process performance begins to play a large explanatory role Poor health is strongly negatively related to qualifications in adulthood particularly for children in persistently poor health These associations are largely explained by differences in performance early in children's academic careers, before the first important transition point The relationship between prenatal maternal smoking and mid-adulthood qualifications is more persistent This article demonstrates that a static conceptualization of childhood health is inadequate to fully understand the dynamic process through which social status and health over the course of childhood have long-run consequences for the adult life course"
0,"Using ideas from cultural and organizational theory, I examine the interplay of individual and congregation-level educational attainment on biblical literalism. Data on 387 congregations and 100,009 worshippers (US Congregational Life Survey, 2001) are used to test hypotheses. Results indicate that the effects of congregational education and individual educational attainment are among the largest effects in models. This study is the first to show that regardless of an individual's own education, affirmations of biblical literalism are less likely when persons with higher education dominate a congregation. This finding brings into relief the important role of social context in persons' belief in biblical literalism. Additionally, congregational education amplifies the influence of individual education on biblical literalism such that the gap in belief between college/non-college education individuals widens in high education congregations. This finding suggests that high education persons more deeply absorb the influence of a more educated congregational context. "
0,"Atheism, agnosticism, and undoubting belief in a one true god are pivotal issues distinguishing religious adherents. Shifts in the rates of atheism and agnosticism can influence the composition of religious markets. Demand side rational actor models and the new demographic approach to religious commitments emphasize the influence of life course dynamics on religious desires. I examine multiple predictors of different types of belief in God using data from the General Social Surveys. I employ ordinal logistic regression to test the effects of social status, gender, race, region and city size, family structure, and denominational affiliation on the odds of being an atheist, agnostic, doubting believer, or a consistent believer. I also examine trends in these belief configurations, and whether cohort variations might evidence a coming shift in the relative rates of belief and unbelief."
0,"Unlike traditional research on educational stratification that focuses on the pursuit of higher education, our study examines why young adults do not make the transition to college, using a nationally representative sample of college non-enrollees (N = 2640). In applying latent class analysis techniques, we identified multiple types of students who do not pursue college. One group of non-enrollees (27.6%) reports forgoing college because the economic barriers are too high - either because of college affordability or family financial responsibility. These youth had both low math test scores and low family income, and thus closely align with regression-based analyses on college enrollment that emphasize academic and economic constraints as the central barriers to educational progress. However, we also identified a second, often overlooked group of youth who had the academic preparation and family income support to enroll in higher education, but decided to forgo college because they preferred to work and to make money (18.3%). The heterogeneous motives of these youth suggest that postsecondary decisions are not always guided by academic and economic barriers, but sometimes driven by previous work experience and perceptions of local opportunities for school and work.

0,"Using data on married women from the sixth survey wave of the Marital Instability over the Life Course (2000, N = 489), we examine the influence of mattering, or the extent to which wives believe they are important to their husbands, on wives' perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor. Mattering taps into wives' beliefs about their husbands' supportiveness of them, as evidenced by respect, concern, and appreciation. We find that the more wives believe they matter to their husbands, the more likely they are to report the division of housework is fair, regardless of the share of housework wives perform, time availability, relative resources, and gender role attitudes. This research contributes to prior work on wives' perceived fairness of the division of household labor by demonstrating the salience of broader emotional dynamics in the marriage. "
0,"Research regarding the impact Of repression on social movements has yielded conflicting findings; some argue that repression decreases the total quantity of protest events while others argue that it motivates protest. To move beyond this impasse, various scholars have suggested exploring how repression influences the quality of social movements. This study assesses the impact repression had on the formation of alliances between different social groups participating in South Korea's democracy movement. Results from negative binomial regression analyses show that repression facilitated the formation of alliances between movement actors at a time when the overall number of protest events decreased. This study contributes to the literature on coercion and mobilization by pointing to the possibility of movement development during low levels of a protest cycle."
0,"Variance function regression models and demographic decomposition methods are applied to identify two dimensions of changes in health disparities (SES-demographic effects vs. compositional effects, between-group disparities vs. within-group disparities) in the US from 1984 to 2007. Using National Health Interview Survey data on self-reported health, we find that disparities in men's health increased, while those of women decreased, for the whole period. Widening men's health disparities are largely driven by increases in the effects of SES-demographic statuses on within-group disparities. These increases are moderated by increasing levels of men's college attainment. But decreasing middle and upper income attainment and a decreasing employment rate further increase men's health disparities. For women, the effects of SES-demographic statuses on health disparities also increased over time. This, however, was outweighed by increases in women's college attainment, middle and upper income attainment, and employment rate. The result is overall declining self-reported health disparities for women. "
0,"Thousands of refugees are being denied access to asylum and resettlement in the United States (U.S.) due to the overly broad application of the material support to terrorism ground of inadmissibility.  Under a relatively new policy, the Department of Homeland Security has been actively applying this bar which was greatly expanded by the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the REAL ID Act of 2005.  This statutory bar has been interpreted to deny refugee protection to refugees and asylees who have been coerced under extreme duressincluding at gunpointto provide so-called material support to groups engaged in broadly defined terrorist activity.  Moreover, refugees associated with resistance movements against dictatorial governments are also largely inadmissible.  Ironically, for many of these persons, the very circumstances that form the basis of their refugee or asylum claimwell-founded fear of persecutionare now grounds for inadmissibility to the U.S.  By failing to take into account the context of violence and an individuals particular circumstances the law punishes victims of terror.  Immigration and terrorism are independent social phenomena stemming from dissimilar causes and with radically different objectives.  Nonetheless, asylum seekers and refugees increasingly find themselves linked to the post September 11th security-migration nexus."
0,"In this paper, I argue that the democracy-mined citizen-professionals who founded and led four key post-9/11 civic renewal organizations that aimed to promote healing and hope by creating real opportunities for citizen participation in rebuilding Lower Manhattan have continued to be motivated by a three-leveled call to leadership; they have been sustained by community fellowship as well as multiple layers of effectiveness of their efforts: civic, professional and personal.   The collective behavior and motivation of the principal leaders of: The Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown for Rebuilding Downtown New York, New York/New Visions, Imagine New York, and Rebuild Downtown New York, started reaching out to their broad network of citizen and professional stakeholders to begin advocating for a voice in the Lower Manhattan healing and rebuilding process shortly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11; each utilizing their formidable civic, professional and personal social capital.  The key leaders of these new civic renewal movements are comprised of individual principal actors who have a highly developed professional orientation and scientific knowledge of the planning, architecture, and legal processes in New York City, in addition to considerable political and economic capital."
0,"Examples drawn from the history of DNA profiling in the United States are used to show how knowledge claims about DNA profiling became part of the wider social structure. A crucial aspect of this process was the formation of new social structures at the micro and macro levels. Social order and knowledge formed within a community of practice, the FBI sponsored Technical Working Group on DNA Methods (TWGDAM), was translated and entrenched in new formal social structures, such as the DNA Identification Act of 1994. This in turn gave further stability and credibility to the knowledge about DNA profiling advanced by TWGDAM, as well as their status as a credible professional organization. This article contributes an understanding of the role that new social structures play in linking the micro and the macro levels of social structure."
0,"Most sociological research, even among students of culture, assumes that networks exert a causal influence on cultural beliefs. Network-focused research has failed to consider the possibility that cultural beliefs or worldviews have an independent effect on the formation of social networks. Building on Emirbayer and Goodwins (1994) structuralist constructionism and using longitudinal data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, this paper shows that the different moral worldviews outlined in Habits of the Heart were causally linked to changes in the ego-networks of young people between 2002 and 2005. These effects are robust to the inclusion of prior network composition and behavioral homophily and are generally stronger than prior network and homophily effects. The study concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for the sociological study of networks and culture."
0,"This paper contributes to our understanding of identity processes of race and ethnic groups with an analysis of the role of place in Native Hawaiian identity. Although the analysis centers on Hawaiians, it offers important insights that may extend to other groups or cultures whose language is endangered, whose culture is known more in its commercial tourist rather than its contemporary authentic form, and whose members are highly intermarried and mobile.  Under these conditions, the concept of place is critical to understanding the cultural survival of a people, as I demonstrate in the case of Native Hawaiians. This study sets out a theoretical perspective of the spatial connections between the homeland of indigenous Hawaiians and their identity by locating the present in the historical locations and subjugations of place, by tracing the genealogical, cultural, and ancestral relations of Native Hawaiians and place, and by mapping how the context of place creates tensions and contradictions in self-definition and identity for Native Hawaiians."
0,"One of the most curious aspects of the 2004 presidential election was the strength and resilience of the belief among many Americans that Saddam Hussein was linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11. Scholars have suggested that this belief was the result of a campaign of false information and innuendo from the Bush administration. We call this the information environment explanation. Using a technique of ""challenge interviews"" on a sample of voters who reported believing in a link between Saddam and 9/11, we propose instead a social psychological explanation for the belief in this link. We identify a number of social psychological mechanisms voters use to maintain false beliefs in the face of disconfirming information, and we show that for a subset of voters the main reason to believe in the link was that it made sense of the administration's decision to go to war against Iraq. We call this inferred justification: for these voters, the fact of the war led to a search for a justification for it, which led them to infer the existence of ties between Iraq and 9/11."
0,"From the early 1980s through 2000, the number and the percentage of African American men in prison skyrocketed.  This would be expected to have negative impacts on Black well-being, but Black child poverty generally decreased during this period.  Using data from the U.S. Prison Census and the Current Population Survey for the period from 1983-1998, we examine the effects of Black imprisonment on Black household composition and Black child poverty, with special attention to the effect of state Black imprisonment rates on household composition and income.  Net of controls, state Black male imprisonment rates increase child poverty through reducing the likelihood that the child's father lives with the family and reducing the income in two-parent families, especially at low parental education levels. Lagged effects of imprisonment are stronger than immediate effects."
0,"In this paper I will examine the practice of doing femininity for monetary gain. In particular, I will review literature on sex workers and drag queens, focusing on both academic literature and primary sources such as blogs written by sex workers and drag queens. It is my contention that drag queens and sex workers are excellent examples of the process of doing emphasized femininity, because both groups consciously exaggerate femininity. While biological women are under pressure to do femininity at all times, one is rarely rewarded in a direct and tangible way for such performances. I also submit that the act of doing emphasized femininity is an aggressively active act that must be achieved passively, which creates a tricky contradiction for sex workers and prostitutes."
0,"Prevailing theory assumes that people enforce norms in order to pressure others to act in ways that they approve. Yet there are numerous examples of ""unpopular norms"" in which people compel each other to do things that they privately disapprove. While peer sanctioning suggests a ready explanation for why people conform to unpopular norms, it is harder to understand why they would enforce a norm they privately oppose. The authors argue that people enforce unpopular norms to show that they have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. They use laboratory experiments to demonstrate this ""false enforcement"" in the context of a wine tasting and an academic text evaluation. Both studies find that participants who conformed to a norm due to social pressure then falsely enforced the norm by publicly criticizing a lone deviant. A third study shows that enforcement of a norm effectively signals the enforcer's genuine support for the norm. These results demonstrate the potential for a vicious cycle in which perceived pressures to conform to and falsely enforce an unpopular norm reinforce one another."
0,"Differential treatment regimens for hypertension by race have been recommended in the U.S. for at least three decades. Using the nationally representative NHANES-III data (1988-1994), we explore the extent to which Black and White hypertensive adults are placed on different treatment regimens, and whether this is due to differences in socioeconomic and demographic factors, relevant comorbidities, and blood biochemistry profiles.  A series of logistic models - controlling for or stratified by race - are used to estimate race differences in the prevalence of five different pharmaceutical interventions for hypertension. The analyses showed persistent racial differences in the prescription of antihypertensive drugs. With some exceptions, these differences were not explained by a comprehensive set of potential socioeconomic, demographic, and biomedical mediators.  An unexpected insight is the moderating effect of sex on the race differences in prescribing different medication types. Our findings suggest that race and sex act as implicit guides for pharmacological treatment of hypertension."
0,"Different forms of capital, as power resource, are commonplace in academia. Academics commonly make a name for themselves in print. Publication in top-tier journals confers prestige to many scholars. In this paper, intellectual capital is used to explain how scientific value becomes affixed to publications. I focus on reception and recognition of research articles valued for tenure and promotion in academic fields from the vantage point of minority scholars. In-depth interviews with Latino faculty at twelve research universities were conducted. Faculty accounts reveal their understanding of the translation of scholarship investments to intellectual capital as playing a decisive role in tenure and promotion. Ideas held by faculty about the link between intellectual capital and academic promotion vary by career longevity, academic rank and discipline. Polemics over the scientificity of research reproductions, the gist of a struggle for symbolic power, suggests new directions for further research on how we report faculty discourse."
0,"This article demonstrates that value of Foucault's conception of discipline for understanding organization responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault's depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to buffer or hide some activities. Members' tendency to internalize these pressures, to become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that rankins produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a crucial task for scholars."
0,"This study examines the earnings of African immigrants across three waves of U. S. Census data (1980, 1990, and 2000). The authors find that the U. S. labor market favors White male immigrants, followed by Black male and White female immigrants, and finally Black women. The authors also find that male immigrants earned more per hour than female immigrants regardless of race. Considering change over time, this study finds that the earnings gap between Black and White male immigrants is growing larger over time, the positive association between foreign work experience and earnings is attenuated over time, and for women, the positive effect of earning a college degree on earnings is growing stronger over time. These findings confirm many of the conclusions reached by other race and gender scholars; however, the authors extend this work by focusing on male and female African immigrants, who are largely under-represented in the literature, and by examining change over time."
0,"How does a radical organization that is founded on ideals of cooperation and egalitarianism reproduce male dominance?  “Group style” provides the starting point for an analysis of power and culture in group interaction that links sexism in American society to the reproduction of Duke Ave’s gender hierarchy.  I build on Eliasoph and Lichterman’s (2003) model of how culture works in interaction by investigating how the micropolitics of meaning-making shape group style.  In their discussions and disagreements about how things should be at Duke Ave, residents articulate ideas about cooperative community in ways that create both group solidarity and hierarchy between men and women.  I unpack the constructed nature of what appear to be ‘male’ and ‘female’ linguistic styles in order to explain how group style reproduces men’s domination in decision-making interactions.  The group style subtley defines reality such that male residents’ concerns appear to be collective concerns while female residents’ concerns appear particular and divisive.  This also contibutes to social psychology by presenting a model of power in meaning-making interactions that shape identities."
0,"How can a nominal descriptive term acquire status beliefs and definitions giving it connotations of differential social worth and competence? Cecilia L. Ridgeway and her associates have developed one theory explaining such effects. Recently Joseph Berger and Hamit Fisek offered a new theory using different mechanisms. We report the first experimental tests of the new theory. One mechanism describes spread of status value through referent individuals who possess both nominal and status characteristics. A second mechanism predicts spread of status value directly from status elements including education and income, without intervening referent actors. Results show that both mechanisms can create positive and negative status value for a nominal characteristic as predicted. "
0,Bicycle messengers have been a ubiquitous part of the urban landscape since the 1980s.  Using Sassens concept of global cities this paper attempts to explain the formation and persistence of the bicycle messenger industry.  I argue that despite increasing importance of telematics bicycle messengers provide an essential economic function within global cities.  This function comes from the ability to quickly deliver physical objects within a dense and congested urban environment.
0,"In recent years the number of women earning advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and math has been on the rise, yet women remain underrepresented at all ranks of the academic hierarchy in STEM fields. We explore the mechanisms in the recruitment and hiring process that hinder or promote the hiring of women into tenure-track jobs in these fields. We rely on data that include the entire pool of applicants to tenure-track faculty positions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics over a five year period at a large public research university. We identify a variety of ways universities and departments can increase the number of women in tenure-track jobs, including placing greater emphasis on increasing the number of female applicants, placing ads in outlets that specifically target women scientists, and increasing the gender diversity of search committees."
0,"Using data from the American Community Survey 2007 and 2009, we investigate differences in co-resident grandparent family structure between the native-born and the foreign-born families in the United States. This comparative approach reveals that whereas nuclear families are the norm in European-origin families in the U.S., other ethnic groups stress the importance of the extended family, familism, and/or filial piety. Given socioeconomic and cultural differences in immigrant families, we hypothesize that 1) co-residential grandparent families will be more common among immigrants and among native-born racial and/ethnic minority groups; 2) immigrant grandparent co-resident families will be more likely to be hosted by the parents; 3) parent-hosted intergenerational families will be more prevalent among immigrants of Asian origin than among other immigrants, and; 4) these differences will exist net of length of time in the U.S., citizenship status, English language proficiency, SES, and other factors. Our results confirm these hypotheses."
0,"This study empirically examines the public and social policy question: Do state restrictive abortion laws affect the likelihood that women use more highly effective contraceptive methods? Using contraceptive use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2002 survey, the empirical results show that Medicaid Funding Restrictions, Informed Consent Laws, and Two-Visit Laws have no significant impact on adult women's (ages 1844, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44) use of highly effective contraceptive methods. A state's antiabortion attitudes, which likely contribute to the enactment of restrictive abortion laws in a state, are a major factor in inducing greater use of highly effective contraceptive methods by adult women at-risk of an unintended pregnancy. The empirical findings remain robust for various population subgroups of adult women (i.e., married, single, employed, unemployed, with children, no children and college educated). "
0,"Human social life is messy, and as a result the practice of sociology is filled with tension, contradiction, conflict, and ambiguity. As a discipline, sociology has generated excellent theories and methodologies for dealing with this complexity. This presidential address suggests that the impact and resonance of sociological knowledge is enhanced further when we open ourselves to the tensions and contradictions we experience personally in our work as sociologists. Critical engagement with these personal conflicts deepens our understanding of the social subject and enriches the sociological imagination. Using the method of ""auto-historia,"" the author describes some of her own experiences of "" going deeper into the contradictions"" and the significance of this process for her professional evolution."
0,"In the social mobility literature, the position generator has been used to examine the relationship between the structural location of individuals, and outcomes such as obtaining a high status job (Lin 1999, Lin et al 2001).  Diversity of occupational ties (as measured by the position generator) is also a significant predictor of an individuals cultural capital (Erickson 1996).  A great deal of work has also been done in the field of social movements examining the relationship between networks and mobilization (Diani and McAdam 2003).  In particular, numerous scholars have examined ego-networks ties as a predictor of individual participation in social movement activities (McAdam 1986, Tindall 2002).  However, only limited attention has been given to the position generator in this literature (for an exception, see Tindall and Cormier forthcoming).  Also, while past research has demonstrated that prior network ties to activists is one of the most important predictors of current activism, relatively little research has been devoted to examining network structure as an outcome of activism.  Indeed Diani (1997) has noted that network structures may be one consequence of social movement mobilization (and a form of social capital). The present paper builds upon these insights by examining data collected using the position generator on a sample of environmental movement members, and examining the relationship between individual activism (as an independent variable) and diversity of occupational ties (as a dependent variable).  Our analysis shows that controlling for an extensive suite of socio-economic, demographic, level of individual activism is a strong and highly significant predictor of diversity of occupational ties (to other movement members).  Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"This study conducts cross-national research on 97 developing countries to test competing hypotheses of poverty. Four major theories from the social sciences, including 1) economic development and openness, 2) geographical and demographical disadvantages, 3) regime characteristics and war, and 4) social policy and human capital enhancement, were examined to determine their explanatory power by modeling the ratio of the poor to total population in those countries. Poverty is defined by living below $1 or $2 a day. Both the incidences of poverty and the poors income shortfall from the non-poor are analyzed with ridge regression modeling. Empirical outcomes reveal that besides a countrys income level, tropics, landlockedness, population growth and secondary schooling opportunity are significant predictors of poverty reduction, whereas political factors (democracy, military spending and war) and government social spending are only weak predictors. No evidence was found to support the economic openness proposed by the neoliberal school."
0,"This research focuses on immigration and youthful illegalities in the Toronto area, one of the world's most ethnically diverse global cities. While current research documents a negative relationship between crime and immigration, there is little attention to individual-level mechanisms that explain the paths through which immigrant youth refrain from illegalities. Through a study of two cohorts of adolescents across two generations (1976, 1999), we elaborate a process model that is generic over both generations, and in which measures of bonds to parents and schools, commitments to education, and dispositions of risk aversity mediate youth involvement in illegalities. By focusing on a period when non-European immigration to Toronto increased dramatically, we then identify a compositional effect through which the more recent cohort is engaged in fewer illegalities."
0,"The biosocial linkage between early pubertal timing and girls problem behaviors is well-established.  An important extension of this line of research considers how early pubertal timing influences girls academic risk, both during early adolescence and beyond.  To investigate this life course phenomenon, this study drew on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study.  Regression analyses revealed a linkage between early pubertal timing and girls GPA and probability of course failure in 9th grade.  Pubertal timing was also associated with GPA at the end of high school and the probability of dropping out of high school but this observed relationship was attenuated once academic risk in 9th grade was taken into account.  These results suggest that the academic disruption related to early pubertal timing resulted in cumulative disadvantages in girls academic attainment."
0,"The causes of revolts have long been a contentious debate in social science.  The more basic idea that there even can be identifiable causes generalised from historical accounts has long yielded malcontent.  Goldstone (1991) presented a theory claiming to broadly predict revolt in the Early Modern world and demonstrated it empirically for peak instances of collective action.   This paper rigorously tests Goldstones model of revolt with more detailed data across all instances in Early Modern France.  The influence of taxation and signalling, demonstrated as important by other theorists, is also tested."
0,"A large number of scholars have examined cultural capital as an explanation for class differences in academic success but routinely use a number of disparate operationalizations of the concept.  Despite an outcry from theorists and qualitative researchers, in-depth quantitative examinations of the mechanisms and pathways of cultural capital are nearly non-existent.  Additionally, most of the literature focuses on cross-sectional data, suffering from the potential bias of unmeasured heterogeneity from cognitive ability or motivation.  In this research, we examine data from a longitudinal study of low-income youth to examine multiple operationalizations of cultural capital and test for mediating effects.  We find that typical operationalizations of cultural capital, museum attendance and reading habits, have positive effects on GPA that are almost completely mediated through academic attitudes and beliefs.  However, other habits and skills, such as homework, skipping class, and disrupting class, have significant direct effects on GPA.  Longitudinal and first difference coefficients indicate that cross-sectional models are biased due to unobserved characteristics.  Overall, these results suggest that different operationalizations of cultural capital exhibit different pathways to academic success."
0,"Since the second wave of feminism the roles and responsibilities of both women and men have been in transition.  Change often spurs anxiety, which leads some individuals to seek out organizations offering support and answers.  This project explores web content of 16 gender segregated organizations to better understand the range of gender discourses available online.  Data collected include types and frequencies of metaphors or figurative language in gender segregated pro-feminist and anti-feminist organizational websites.  This paper focuses on mens organizations, but uses additional data from womens organizations to test the dispersion of particular discursive themes. Images of education, community involvement and justice emerge as important to all groups, but the differences between groups reveal that stance toward feminism is a stronger force than gender within these gender segregated groups."
0,"To mobilize support for war and to control dissent, governments draw upon deeply engrained discourses regarding soldiering and the citizen's duty to support the troops. We identify the cultural and political evolution of the discursive legacy of ""support the troops"" from the Vietnam War through the Iraq War. Using longitudinal and comparative organizational analyses, we analyze how this discursive legacy was engaged by U. S. peace movement organizations (PMOs)."
0,"Why do populations often self-organize into antagonistic groups even in the absence of competition over scarce resources? Is there a tendency to demarcate groups of us and them that is inscribed in our cognitive architecture? We look for answers by exploring the dynamics of influence and attraction between computational agents. Our model is an extension of Hopfields attractor network. Agents are attracted to others with similar states (the principle of homophily) and tend to converge toward the states of agents to whom they are attracted, given the strength and valence of the social tie. Negative valence implies xenophobia (instead of homophily) and differentiation (instead of imitation). Consistent with earlier work on structural balance, we find that networks can self-organize into two antagonistic factions, without the knowledge or intent of the agents. We investigate this tendency as a function of network size, the number of potentially contentious issues, and agents' openness and flexibility toward alternative positions. The surprising finding is that the global alignment of a multi-dimensional opinion space along a single polarizing definition of opposing ideologies is facilitated by the ideological flexibility and open-mindedness of local constituents."
0,"How are public legal rights created by a legislature privatized (i.e., moved into the private sector) by business organizations?  To answer this question nestled at the intersection of organizations and law, I draw on two bodies of research that often ignore one another: political science studies of how organizations influence public legal institutions and neo-institutional organizational sociology studies of how organizations shape law within their organizational field.  By integrating these diverse literatures, I demonstrate how an organizational fields construction of what constitutes compliance shapes the meaning of law among legislators and courts.   Specifically, my case study examines case law and over thirty-five years of California legislative history concerning its consumer warranty protection laws.  I show how automobile manufacturers initially subject to powerful consumer protection laws created private dispute resolution venues that the legislature subsequently incorporated into statutes and made consumer rights and remedies contingent on first using manufacturer dispute resolution structures.  Further, I demonstrate how the legislature and courts consistently deferred to these private venues.  When legal and organizational fields overlap, organizational norms and values concerning private institutional venues flow into the legislative and judicial arena and shape the meaning of law.  This paper concludes by positing that organizational responses to law in the consumer context results in a transformation and weakening of the formal rights, which I refer to as the holsterization of rights, i.e., the process whereby initially strong public legal rights are (1) redefined and (2) controlled by private organizations."

0,"This article explores how a sample of college students discursively negotiated perceptions of race and ability in the context of mediated sport. A majority of respondents expressed acceptance of a link between racial identity and sport-specific skills. However, rather than articulate this notion overtly and directly, rhetorical strategies, such as disclaimers and coded language, were used. We analyze these responses as a form of ""racetalk"" (Bonilla-Silva and Forman 2000) to more specifically unpack the significance of discourse within the post-Civil Rights Movement era. Although the language used to discuss race in this sample, like the contemporary era more generally, appears colorblind and progressive on the surface, it is undergirded by a distinct form of color consciousness."
0,"In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels (1979) argued that the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie (p. 82). In other words, the state is an instrument for the capitalist class to rule the working class. This paper will seek to critically examine the relevance of this claim in Singapore today, looking specifically at the issue of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The assumption is that government policies are a result of social tensions and conflicts, thus the decisions made (resulting in government policies) reveals the state alliance to certain interests. Given the limitations of an academic paper, the strategy adopted here is to look at government policies regarding the administering of Anti-Retroviral drugs (ARV) for HIV patients."
0,"This research examines the relationship between disabilities in families and returns to welfare. Past studies of welfare recidivism have long theorized that disabilities played a central role in returns to welfare among former recipients, but lacked data to test the hypothesis. Hypothesis tests support the theory that both child and maternal disabilities, which act as barriers to self-sufficiency, increase rates of TANF re-entry and SSI entry. We show that because past studies did not account for disabilities on the odds of returning to welfare, effects of work, number of children, and past receipt of TANF are somewhat overstated. Our findings add to the literature on welfare recidivism and have implications for welfare reforms that emphasize work and lifetime limits on benefits. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Acceptance by the dominant group reveals the current standing of racial groups in the U.S. hierarchy, as well as the possibility for assimilation. However, few researchers have addressed the gendered nature of racial preferences by whites. We examine whites' exclusion of blacks, Latinos. Asians, Middle Easterners, East Indians and Native Americans as possible dates, using a sample of profiles collected from an internet dating website. We find that white men are more willing than white women to date non-whites in general, yet, with the exception of their top two preferences for dates, whites and Latinos, the racial hierarchies of males and females differ. Among daters with stated racial preferences, white men are more likely to exclude blacks as possible dates, while white women are more likely to exclude Asians. We argue that exclusion relates to racialized images of masculinity and femininity, and shapes dating and marriage outcomes, and thus minority groups' possibilities for full social incorporation. "
0,"This article builds on social movement theory to explain ideological variation among socialist, social democratic, and labor parties across 18 countries in the early twentieth century. We propose a causal argument connecting (1) the political emergence of the bourgeoisie and its middle-class allies to (2) the political space for labor unions and working-class parties, which (3) provided a setting for internal pressures and external opportunities that shaped socialist party ideology. Combining quantitative analysis and case studies, we find that the timing of civil liberties and the strength of socialist links with labor unions were decisive for reformism or radicalism. Refining Lipset's prior analysis, we qualify his claim that male suffrage provides a key to socialist orientation."
0,"The measurement of social norms plays a pivotal role in many social sciences. While economists predominantly conduct experiments, sociologists rather employ (factorial) surveys. Both methods, however, suffer from distinct weaknesses. Experiments, on the one hand, often fall short in the measurement of more complex elements, such as the conditionality or the level of consensus of social norms. Surveys, on the other, lack the ability to measure actual behavior. This paper argues that the so-called ""strategy method"" compensates for both weaknesses. We can demonstrate the applicability of the strategy method for the measurement of conditionality and consensus of fairness norms which take individual effort into account. To substantiate our claim, we present a methodological experiment comparing results for the strategy ultimatum game with those from a ""conventional"" ultimatum game. We find that offers do not differ, but the acceptance rate is substantially lower in the strategy method experiment compared to the conventional one. This confirms our theoretical expectations that strategy method experiments rather measure normative principles, whereas the ""conventional"" method the willingness to sacrifice own profits to adhere to these principles. Our results are consistent with previous comparative research between factorial surveys and observational data. "
0,"This article argues that social movements can contribute to the development and integration of new narratives into the cultural stock by sponsoring new rhetorical frames and by sponsoring legislation, thus entering into policy debates. A case study of a new cultural narrative, dubbed ""virgin chic,"" shows the imprints of the American Right. Through analysis of the mobilizing efforts of right-wing think tanks, this article shows that the Right's development of the ""family values"" frame and its sponsorship of federal bills aimed at legislating morality resulted in ""virgin chic."" Analysis of the origins and career of this narrative shows that it circulated widely (and continues to circulate, 20 years after its emergence in 1990), and that it successfully carries right-wing ideology into popular culture."
0,"This study examines the influence of partner relationship quality on childbearing. We are innovative in using relationship quality reports from both partners, drawing on the first and second wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study. Thus, we can identify potential effects of discordant perceptions of the relationship on childbearing. We also pose a new hypothesis on the direction of the effect of relationship quality on fertility, predicting that medium levels of relationship quality result in the highest childbearing rates. Our results indicate that only women's perceptions of relationship quality influence a first birth, whereas women's and men's perceptions affect second births. We do not find unique effects of disagreement in assessments of relationship quality; effects of partners' perceptions are additive. Women reporting medium levels of relationship quality are most likely to have a(nother) child, whereas men with medium and high quality relationships are most likely to have a second child. "
0,"The proportional odds assumption in ordered logit models is a restrictive assumption that is often violated in practice. A violation of the assumption indicates that the effects of one or more independent variables significantly vary across cutpoint equations in the model. In order to relax this assumption for the cumulative odds model, researchers may use either a ""partial"" model that relaxes the assumption for a subset of variables or the ""generalized"" model that relaxes the assumption for every independent variable. In this paper, we propose a relatively new and under-utilized third alternative, the proportional odds with partial proportionality constraints (POPPC) model, which allows the effects of a subset of variables to vary across cutpoint equations by a common factor. We improve upon an earlier formulation of the POPPC model by offering an additional conceptual justification for the model and an estimation method that does not require the use of person-threshold data. We illustrate the POPPC model with two examples from the 2008 General Social Survey. "
0,"To what extent do organizational hiring practices contribute to the variation in men's share of hospital registered nursing ( RN) positions? The answer to this question provides key insight into the process of workplace sex segregation in a traditionally feminine field. To that end, the present analyses examine how informal and formal hiring practices in over sixty Pacific Northwest hospitals affect the share of men holding hospital RN positions. Findings from Tobit regression analyses indicate that men's share of hospital RN jobs increases with an increased use of informal referrals to recruit RNs. Supervisor monitoring of hiring decisions, hospital use of walk-ins, and employment agency referrals to recruit RN applicants have no effect on men's share of RN positions. Although unexpected, these results are explicable in light of the occupation's feminine gender type and gender status beliefs. The author discusses the implications of these findings for research investigating the sex segregation process in gender-typed occupations."
0,"Extracurricular participation has been found to have positive effects on many outcomes, including educational attainment. Past research has offered theoretical explanations, but not looked for differences in these effects across different school socioeconomic compositions. These positive effects may fail to materialize in high poverty schools, calling into question the theoretical explanations offered so far. This paper uses hierarchical modeling techniques to analyze the effects of participation in the high school extracurriculum on the odds of graduation and of attending postsecondary education. Using cross-level interaction terms, the paper also analyzes the differences in these effects across schools of differing socioeconomic compositions. Participation is found to have positive effects in various categories of participation, and these effects hold across schools regardless of socioeconomic composition. These findings illustrate the importance of the extracurriculum in all schools, particularly as one area where students from disadvantaged backgrounds can close the educational inequality gap."

So far, this moderator effect has not been studied in other societies. Are there also weaker effects of parental divorce and single parenthood for blacks in other countries? We answer this question by analyzing Caribbeans in the Netherlands. We analyze effects of parental divorce and separation on eight outcome indicators for children in adulthood and we compare these effects between Caribbeans and whites. We show that for Caribbeans there are no effects of parental divorce on own divorce, cohabitation, leaving home, and contact frequency with the father, much in contrast to the effects for whites. For socioeconomic outcomes, however, the effects are similar for Caribbeans and whites. "
0,Few studies of social movement political success investigate the strategic and tactical approaches used to achieve positive political outcomes. This work investigates a rarely studied mobilization of U. S. women in the first half of the 20th century to explore how movement organizations bring about legal change. Archival data for 15 states are examined to investigate how women won the right to sit on juries. The authors argue that jury movement activists engaged in strategic adaptation were more likely to win a change in jury laws rapidly. Those not engaged in such strategic action won their reforms more slowly. The authors suggest that when social movement actors tailor their actions to respond to exigencies in the environment they are more likely to expedite political success.
0,"Organizational form matters, especially in fields in which values matter.  How the organization is structured becomes as important as its activities in value-driven enterprises.  In this paper, the author describes the institutionalization of nonprofit technology assistance as a field of nonprofit practice in which formal organizations sprung from earlier movements to provide technology to nonprofits.  In the burgeoning field of technology assistance, the formal organization model represents a latecomer that simultaneously competes and collaborates with pre-existing models.  However, as nonprofits are pressed to do more with less, NTAPs face increasing pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of their activities and the sustainability of their models while fighting to secure institutional recognition within the nonprofit sector as a whole.  A comparison of these models yields insights into the changing foci of value-driven organizations as they attempt to find ways of sustaining their models."
0,"Few researchers of Internet sexual exploration have systematically compared variance of use across sexual orientations, with even fewer surveying bisexual respondents. In 2004, 15,246 individuals responded to an online survey of their use of Internet personals. Gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals were more likely than heterosexuals to have exchanged correspondence, met individuals offline, and had sex with someone they met through personal ads. Whereas gay men and lesbians of all ages were most likely to have established a long-term relationship as a result of personals, heterosexuals over age 40 were more likely to have established a long-term relationship than younger heterosexuals. Further, compared to men, women were approximately two times as likely to have established a serious relationship as a result of personals. Qualitative findings suggest that the Internet functions not only as a means of screening for desired characteristics, but also as a shield against prejudice in real life encounters. Sexual minorities and heterosexuals alike used online venues as a means of sexual identity development, sexual exploration, and community building."
0,"Studies of involuntary job loss using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) generally go no further than the early 1990s due to the omission of the question identifying the reason for job loss in the years 1994 to 1997.  With the inclusion of this identifying data from 1999 onward, this paper updates trends in involuntary job loss for the years 1999 to 2005."
0,"Using data from 19,839 adolescents from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this study investigates whether the effects of parental divorce on adolescents' academic test performance vary by sibship size. Analyses show that the negative effect of divorce on adolescent performance attenuates as sibship size increases. On the other side of the interaction, the inverse relationship between sibship size and test performance is weaker in disrupted than in two-biological-parent families. Trends of such interactions are evident when sibship size is examined either as a continuous or a categorical measure. Finally, the observed interactions on adolescents' academic performance are completely explained by variations in parental financial, human, cultural, and social resources. In sum, this study underlines the importance of treating the effect of parental divorce as a variable and calls for more research to identify child and family features that may change the magnitude of such an effect.

0,"This research investigates variation in hate crime offending against Arabs and Muslims across U.S. counties in the months before and after September 11, 2001. Four questions are of particular interest. First, what were the determinants of anti-Arab and Muslim hate crimes prior to 9/11? Second, in what social contexts were Arabs and Muslims at greatest risk of victimization? Third, to what extent did hate crimes against these groups increase after the terrorist attacks? And last, did the predictors of hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims change appreciably after 9/11? Findings show that hate crimes targeting Arabs and Muslims increased dramatically in the months following 9/11, although the structural determinants and geographic concentration of these crimes remained largely consistent after the attacks. Negative binomial regression results further suggest that counties with larger concentrations of Arabs and Muslims have higher incidents of such hate crimes, which likely reflects the availability of targets for this type of offending. At the same time, the likelihood of victimization for a given Arab or Muslim person is lowest in counties where the percent Arab or percent Muslim is highest, in line with a power-differential perspective on discrimination and intergroup violence. The findings imply, that terrorist attacks may indeed incite retaliation and set off a wave of hate crime offending, but the location of these crimes is likely to remain consistent after a galvanizing event."
0,"Housing in the United States constitutes the largest expenditure for many households, while the value and equity held in owned-housing represents a substantial source of wealth for families.   Rising housing costs, recent changes in the home mortgage industry, and the emerging dominance of immigrants in the U.S. housing market make it important to explore how immigrants are faring in these domains. The current project employs data from the New Immigrant Survey to examine three areas of housing that have lacked sufficient empirical study:  the proportion of household income allocated to housing costs (shelter cost burden), the present value of homes, and home equity.  The analyses document more positive housing outcomes for Latin American immigrants than observed in previous scholarship.  However, the results also indicate that significant differences by country/region of origin and race persist after controlling for variation in individual and household characteristics, migration history, housing characteristics, and location."
0,"U.S. immigrants are a physically healthy population, but we do not understand the explanatory factors responsible for their physical health status, particularly those related to social network support. Using data from the 2001 wave of the National Health Interview Survey, we examine multiple measures of immigrant adaptation, investigating their influence on measures of physical health. In particular, we examine how well indicators of social support and integration explain the immigrant health advantage. Results show clear evidence of an immigrant paradox in physical health, but that measures of support and integration explain almost none of the immigration effect on physical health."
0,"Using data from the New Immigrant Survey, we examine the religious beliefs and practices of new legal immigrants to the United States. We find that Christian immigrants are more Catholic, more Orthodox, and less Protestant than American Christians, and that those immigrants who are Protestant are more likely to be evangelical. In addition to being more Catholic and more Orthodox than American Christians, the new immigrants are also paradoxically less Christian, with a fifth reporting some other faith. Detailed analysis of reported church attendance at places of origin and in the United States suggest that immigration is a disruptive event that alienates immigrants from religious practice rather than ""theologizing"" them. In addition, our models clearly show that people who join congregations in the United States are highly selected and unrepresentative of the broader population of immigrants in any faith. In general, congregational members were more observant both before and after emigration, were more educated, had more cumulative experience in the United States, and were more likely to have children present in the household and be homeowners and therefore yield biased representations of all adherents to any faith. The degree of selectivity and hence bias also varies markedly both by religion and nationality. "
0,"While income inequality among college graduates is well documented, inequality in occupational status remains largely unexplored. We examine whether and how occupational specificity of college majors is related to college graduates' transition into the labor market and their subsequent occupational trajectories. Analyses of NLSY79 indicate that occupationally specific degrees are beneficial at the point of entry into the labor market but have the lowest growth in occupational status over time. Students earning credentials focusing on general skills, in contrast, begin in jobs with low occupational status but subsequently report the greatest growth. These findings illuminate specific ways in which educational and occupational systems interact and provide a novel approach for understanding inequality in labor market outcomes among college graduates."
0,"Based on interviews with 30 sets of parents, this article examines how the respondents experience the process of ""letting go"" of their college-bound children. The focus of our analysis is on how the parents evaluate the meanings of their children's leaving home and adopt strategies to facilitate the process for both themselves and the departing child.  Our interview materials allowed us to recognize and then parse the paradoxical task faced by parents of fostering ""attached individuation"" for both themselves and their children.   In the articles data sections we address four broad and persistent themes that emerged from our conversations with parents.  First, we consider how parents manage the range of sometimes-conflicting emotions generated by the letting go process.  Second, we analyze the content of parents worries as a good unobtrusive measure of how they understand the transition to college as a ritual marker in their children's lives.  Third, we show how negotiations about geography -- about proper distance from home -- in choosing a college reflect efforts to impose a measure of gradualism into the letting go process.  Finally, we report on how parents theorize the impact of a child's departure on family relationships in general."
0,"Expectation states theory employs several scope statements to specify the situational conditions that must be met for any test of the theory to be considered valid (Foschi, 1997). Collective orientation and task orientation are two scope conditions that researchers frequently implement as selection criteria for a participant's inclusion in an analytic sample. Although excluding participants who fail to meet scope conditions is theoretically consistent, researchers have yet to establish how this practice affects experimental outcomes. I employ meta-analysis to compare studies within the expectation states tradition in which participants are excluded for failure to meet scope conditions to studies in which no similar exclusions are made. Results suggest that studies that exclude participants for scope violations demonstrate a decreased baseline tendency to reject influence. I contend that adopting a more universal approach to the measurement and application of scope conditions would be methodologically and theoretically beneficial to expectation states research. "
0,"Past research on the social significance of sound has not addressed the processes by which sounds generate meaning within an environment.  We propose a model whereby sound operates within a place to create a non-human identity through the phenomenological production of meaning.  Once an identity of a place is established, the definition of the situation can be created, which guides behavior for human actors.  Although this model is not formally tested, suggestions for appropriate methods to do so are given."
0,"Export-only diffusion occurs when innovators do not adopt an innovation themselves, but rather promote it to others for adoption. Potential adopters do not take their cues from early adopters, but rather from diffusion professionals who make it their job to spread a practice or institution. The global spread of national-level, population-control policies during the Cold War is one such instance: developed and promoted by wealthy countries that did not themselves adopt such policies, they came to be widespread among poorer countries, thanks in large part to the mobilization of diffusion professionals. This article offers an analytical account of this diffusion, as well as an event-history analysis of 163 countries over the period 1950-1990 demonstrating the importance of linkages between policy adopters and the non-adopting institutions of diffusion professionals."
0,"In the Clash of Civilizations, Samuel Huntington writes that ""cultural identities, which at the broadest level are civilizational identities, are shaping the patterns of cohesion, disintegration, and conflict in the post Cold War world."" Yet a transnational civil society has emerged and continues to expand, integrating peoples from diverse regions of the world who are mobilized around common values, interests, and goals. As one realm of global civil society, transnational social movement organizations (TSMOs) serve to link peoples from diverse regions. However, it is the countries of the global north that remain the most highly represented in this sector. TSMO participation can certainly be drawn along Huntington's civilizational lines, with the Christian west being highly represented and the Muslim and non-Muslim Asian East being far less so. Is it possible, then, that the dynamic of civilizational difference is played out in transnational civil society? What of global culture and its proposed propensity for uniting peoples across civilizational, or, more modestly, cultural divides? This analysis tests for civilizational differences in the geography of TSMO participation and explores two alternative hypotheses related to patterns of TSMO participation. First, that the level of societal liberalization will condition patterns of participation irrespective of civilizational differences, and second, that global-historical processes, specifically colonial history and state integration into the world polity, affect rates of participation. The findings refute the argument that civilizational differences account for the uneven geography of TSMO participation."
0,"We use categorical and logistic regression models to investigate the extent that family structure affects children's health outcomes at age five (i.e., child's type of health insurance coverage, the use of a routine medical doctor, and report of being in excellent health) using a sample of 4,898 children from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study. We find that children with married biological parents are most likely to have private health insurance compared with each of three other relationship statuses. With each additional child in the home, a child is less likely to have private insurance compared with no insurance and Medicaid insurance. Children with cohabiting biological parents are less likely to have a routine doctor compared with children of married biological parents, yet having additional children in the household is not associated with having a routine doctor. Children with biological parents who are not romantically involved and those with additional children in the household are less likely to be in excellent health, all else being equal."
0,"A recent Mexican survey is used to examine whether the often stated stereotype of male violence toward women among indigenous peoples in Mexico is true or is the result of misattribution of contextual and structural effects to racial and ethnic characteristics.  We include couples' cultural and ethnic homogamy/heterogamy as a key variable.  Our results show that homoganous couples are at the same risk of partner violence regardless of their ethnicity.  Women in heterogamous couples in which the male is indigenous are at elevated risk of suffering violence, and indigenous women in heterogamous couples are at a lower risk.  The implications for future research and the need of taking into consideration the impact of homogamy/heterogamy in culturally heterogeneous nations are discussed."
0,"This project examines the interaction between race and religion in shaping peoples support for government assistance to the poor. Previous research reports conflicting results about the ways that religion impacts attitudes about poverty, and this analysis contributes to existing literature by looking at the specific interaction of religious affiliation with race. The data used are from the General Social Survey for the years 2000, 2002, and 2004. Results of the analysis show that overall, blacks are more supportive of government assistance to the poor than whites, and there is a significant interaction effect between religious affiliation and race. Among whites, those with fundamentalist religious affiliations are less supportive of assistance to the poor than those with liberal religious affiliations, but fundamentalism has the opposite effect among blacks. Blacks with fundamentalist religious affiliations are the most supportive of government assistance to the poor. These results indicate the necessity of examining race when analyzing the influence of religious affiliation on attitudes about poverty."
0,"Based on extensive interviews with commercial fishermen in two fishing communities in the Northeast United States, this paper delves into sophisticated forecast use and needs of a particular group of forecast users. In the process, this paper interrogate the dynamics between expert and lay knowledge by unearthing fundamental similarities in the way fishermen and forecasters engage with weather and weather information. In light of fishermens weather-related decision making process, it ultimately argues that the extent to which the weather forecast is considered good by its users has, paradoxically, very little to do with its accuracy, a fact that critically confounds forecasters' claims to expertise and undermines their credibility."
0,"Weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit, Hurricane Rita wreaked havoc between the Texas and Louisiana. While elements of emergency response could have been more efficient, the response to the hurricanes of non-government organizations filled gaps and played a significant role in ensuring the safety of disaster victims in addition to their routine activities, demonstrating the strengths and capacities of their local expertise, social networks and capability to serve a broad constituent of at-risk populations. Among these groups, anti-violence organizations drew upon skills developed and strengthened in their every day work. Coupled with a rich array of social networks, a southwestern Louisiana anti-violence shelter demonstrated the particular capacities that are too often ignored by formal disaster response. This work uses resource dependency as a theoretical framework, which focuses on organizational adaptation, as manifest in physical, human and social capital. With an increasing emphasis on strengthening physical capital, other intangible forms of capital have been overlooked. Twenty-five in-depth interviews with key participants involved in anti-violence shelters exposed aspects of organizational response and recovery. The response and recovery of SWLA Womens Shelter demonstrates that there are non-economic resources that contribute to and organizations continuity."
0,"We show that the progress of technological knowledge is an inherently ecological process, wherein the growth rate of each technology domain depends on dynamics occurring in other technology domains. We identify two sources of ecological interdependence among technology domains First, there are symbiotic interdependencies, implying that the rate of growth of one technology domain is driven by the advances made in other technology domains. Second, some technology domains compete with each other, implying that the rate at which a given technology domain advances varies inversely with the competitive pressure it receives from other technology domains. Based on all the technological knowledge patented in the United States between 1975 and 1999, we find statistical support for our argument and hypotheses."
0,"Incarceration diminishes the life-chances of adults, but little is known about how parental incarceration affects children. Effects on early childhood aggressive behaviors are especially intriguing because of the strong connections between early childhood aggressive behaviors and future criminality. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth cohort study of children born in urban centers at the close of the 20th century, this paper considers the effects of paternal incarceration on childrens aggressive behaviors at age 5. Results show strong effects of paternal incarceration on aggressive behaviors for boys but not girls. Results also show that effects are concentrated among boys living with their fathers at the time of his incarceration. The use of various modeling strategies and alternate dependent and independent variables demonstrates the robustness of the finding  and shows that effects are largest on physically aggressive acts, precisely the acts most strongly connected with future criminal activity. Results also indicate that paternal incarceration does lead to more problem behaviors for children  at least in some areas  and suggest that paternal incarceration may promote the intergenerational transmission of crime and incarceration."
0,"This paper reports the results of a pilot study (n=86) examining undergraduate students views of aging and the elderly.  Students completed a survey tapping their attitudes toward the elderly, personal anxieties about aging, and definitions of the start of ""old age"" for women and men.  In addition, they were asked to draw a picture of an elder which was coded for content related to stereotypes of the elderly (e.g., facial expressions, signs of impairment).  The results revealed several gender differences that relate to the double standard of aging -- which argues that aging is viewed as a more negative experience for women than men.  Compared with men, women reported significantly more anxiety about their own aging, expressing particularly high levels of concern about declines in physical attractiveness and having adequate family support in later life.  Women also were significantly more likely than men to depict wrinkles in their sketch of an elder.  Further reflecting the double standard of aging, both men and women reported lower ages at which women are considered to be old, compared with men.  These analyses indicate that social constructions of gender, age, and beauty influence young adults' perceptions of aging, including anxieties about their own later years."
0,"Hooking up is a dominant form of sexual encounter among college students and has replaced dating as the way students form relationships. But what it entails is opaque, even to the students. I identify behaviors engaged in when hooking up and the demographic correlates of having in oral or vaginal sex through a survey of 14,600 college students. Kissing and touching breasts or buttocks are the most common activities; most hookups also include manual genital stimulation. Many hookups involve oral and vaginal sex and multivariate analyses show marked variation by a number of characteristics in having either. Religious service attendance and GPA have a negative relationship with having oral or vaginal sex. Age and a history of hooking up with this partner have a positive relationship. Women are less likely to engage in oral sex, and Hispanics are less likely than whites to engage in either oral or vaginal sex."
0,"Over 80 percent of congregations in the U.S. offer at least one social service program and by conservative estimates this represents over 250,000 congregations. Previous research seeking to explain congregation-based social services tends to focus on churches’ internal characteristics, while ignoring their ties with external organizations. This study broadens the analytical frame by investigating congregations’ collaborator networks and how they influence their social service activity. Social capital theory, applied to congregations as organizational actors, suggests that the number and types of collaborators a congregation has can affect the number and types of programs it offers. Using data from a nationally representative sample of congregations, this study finds a significant relationship between congregations’ collaborator networks and their program sponsorship patterns. Specifically, congregations that collaborate offer more programs, congregations that collaborate with secular organizations offer more programs, and congregations with similar collaborator networks offer a similar menu of programs. In addition, the study challenges previous research by demonstrating the insignificance of theological orientation and declining significance of religious tradition in predicting congregations’ social service activity."
0,"This article extends research on the consequences of mass imprisonment and the factors shaping population health and health inequalities by considering the associations between imprisonment and population health measured as life expectancy at birth and the infant mortality rate and black-white differences in population health using state-level panel data from the United States (N = 669), 1980-2004. Results show that imprisonment is significantly associated with poorer population health, though associations between imprisonment and infant mortality and female life expectancy are somewhat more consistently statistically significant than are associations with male life expectancy, and associations are more pronounced and statistically significant for blacks than they are for whites. Results also show, however, that increases in imprisonment are associated with decreases in the mortality rates of young black men. Thus, though imprisonment tends to be associated with higher mortality risk and greater black-white differences in mortality, it may, in the short-run, have some paradoxical mortality benefits for young black men.

0,"This article uses a feminist framework to explore embodied aging by analyzing in-depth formal interviews with 57 men and women in their 60s, 70s and 80s. Emphasizing intersectionality, I focus on the interpretations and strategies these men and women use to make sense of their aging bodies. Their aging corporeal experiences allow me to examine ageist notions about aging and being old and to explore how this thinking, which valorizes youthfulness, shapes their aging experiences."
0,"This article examines the transition to adulthood among 1.5-generation undocumented Latino young adults. For them, the transition to adulthood involves exiting the legally protected status of K to 12 students and entering into adult roles that require legal status as the basis for participation. This collision among contexts makes for a turbulent transition and has profound implications for identity formation, friendship patterns, aspirations and expectations, and social and economic mobility. Undocumented children move from protected to unprotected, from inclusion to exclusion, from de facto legal to illegal. In the process, they must learn to be illegal, a transformation that involves the almost complete retooling of daily routines, survival skills, aspirations, and social patterns. These findings have important implications for studies of the 1.5- and second-generations and the specific and complex ways in which legal status intervenes in their coming of age. The article draws on 150 interviews with undocumented 1.5-generation young adult Latinos in Southern California."
0,"In the past few decades, Americans have seen an increased investment in social capital by the United States government, particularly as it pertains to higher education. The Federal Government has attempted to ameliorate many of its discriminatory and racist practices that have continually subjugated minorities to the lowest rungs of society as evidenced by the 1965 Higher Education Act and subsequent amendments.  It is my contention that social capital is strongly correlated to educational attainment.  Thus, because Latinos and African Americans have historically been discriminated against in their pursuit of higher education; their access to social capital has been severely limited.  Furthermore, we argue that the current disproportionate federal funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) compared to Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) is due directly to the de facto segregation historically encountered by Latinos.  The practice of de facto segregation is much more subversive than the de jure segregation encountered by African Americans.  As a result, the federal government continues to discriminate against Latinos by disproportionately investing more in HBCUs than HSIs, thus, reducing the educational attainment and social capital for Latinos. This paper illustrates how the differences in federal appropriations disproportionately affect Latinos and how this disproportion relates to social capital."
0,Some sociologists have recently argued that a major aim of sociological inquiry is to identify the mechanisms by which cause and effect relationships in the social world come about. This article argues that existing accounts of social mechanisms are problematic because they rest on either inadequately developed or questionable understandings of social action. Building on an insight increasingly common among sociological theorists-that action should be conceptualized in terms of social practices-I mobilize ideas from the tradition of classical American pragmatism to develop a more adequate theory of mechanisms. I identify three kinds of analytical problems the theory is especially well poised to address and then lay out an agenda for future research.
0,"This paper investigates organic agriculture in Maine, with a comparative eye turned to the opposite coast.  Californias organic agriculture has been the subject of intense scrutiny (Guthman 2004; Mello 2006; Pollan 2006) and many have reached the conclusion that organic agriculture is bifurcated into an organic industry and an organic movement.  Recent analyses have also shown how the organic industry has come to dominate organic agriculture and to replicate many of the undesirable features of conventional agriculture.  The analysis of organic agriculture in Maine reveals that, at present, Maine has avoided many of the negative consquences of the organic industry, largely because of the smaller size and scale of the organic sector in Maine and through a deliberate (and state-supported) strategy of localization.  Maines organic agriculture remains closer to the organic ideal type and to its movement origins, and hence provides one model for an alternative and sustainable agriculture."
0,"Most undergraduates work despite evidence that working while in college is associated with lower rates of degree completion.  Prior research indicates that the propensity to work varies by both family income and education, suggesting that both financial and social capital operate to reduce work and preserve educational advantage.  We test that hypothesis with a sample of 3,000 low-income Wisconsin undergraduates enrolled in the state’s 42 public two-year and four-year colleges and universities.  Leveraging an experiment that distributes financial aid via lottery, we identify effects of financial capital on labor force participation that are comparable in magnitude to the positive benefits of social capital obtained through parental education.  Specifically, the allocation of additional financial aid reduces the hours worked by low-income students with high school-educated parents to the point that it nearly fully offsets the socioeconomic advantage (in terms of fewer hours worked) that accrues to students from college-educated families.   Need-based financial aid, it appears, may be an equalizer that promises to reduce labor force participation and enhance college attainment."
0,"This study examines the intergenerational effects of changes in womens education distribution in South Korea. Departing from the conventional approach in research in social stratification, I examine the effects of changes in womens educational attainment in one generational on the education distribution in the next generation. Using simulation methods based on multi-equation population renewal model (Mare and Maralani 2006), I examine how intergenerational transmission, assortative mating, and differential fertility influence the intergenerational effects. I found that the magnitude of intergenerational effects depends on how marriage behaviors respond to changing womens educational distribution. When assortative mating patterns correspond to the changes in womens educational distribution, the intergenerational effects are amplified substantially. By contrast, differential fertility is not an important component of intergenerational effects: existence of fertility differentials does not make difference. Finally, the intergenerational effects are smaller for the younger cohorts than for the older cohorts. This is a consequence of weakened intergenerational association and saturation of educational attainment for the younger cohorts."
0,"Guided by professions theory, we explore the role of structural factors in explaining Canadian family physicians provision of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Our results suggest that organizational settings discourage the use of CAM, while solo clinical practices are most conducive to its use. We also found that those trained in French-language medical schools are less likely than their English-language trained colleagues to use CAM, and that physicians in British Columbia are the most likely to offer CAM.  Surprisingly, however. Provincial differences do not appear to be related to differences in legislation regarding CAM use. These findings hold despite controlling for important characteristics of the physicians and patients, suggesting that structural factors play an important role in influencing physicians behavior."
0,"This study sets out to investigate whether introducing molecular genetic measures into an analysis of sexual partner variety will yield novel sociological insights. The data source is the white male DNA sample in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors' empirical gene-environment interaction analysis produces a robust protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype relative to the Any10R genotype in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). This protective effect tends to be lost in schools in which higher proportions of students start having sex early, as well as in individuals with relatively low cognitive ability. The genetics-informed sociological analysis here suggests that explaining a human trait or behavior may require a theory that accommodates the complex interplay between social contextual and individual influences and genetic predispositions."
0,"The transition to adulthood represents a period in the life course marked by numerous changes in the realms of education, work and family.  These transitions occur within larger trajectories, which, when considered together, represent multifaceted pathways to adulthood.  Focusing on five roles in the transition to adulthood including work status, student status, marriage status, living arrangement and parenthood, we utilize an operationalization of these multifaceted pathways based on two-staged latent class analysis (Macmillan and Eliason 2003).  We examine differences across five latent life pathways in depressed mood.  Our results indicate that individuals who are most likely to be on the normative on-time latent life pathway have better mental health than individuals who make a precocious transition to parenthood or those who delay family formation through their late twenties.  The differences in mental health are explained primarily by financial stressors and work related issues.  These analyses suggest that financial stressors and work problems are at the root of the mental health difficulties of young people who transition to adulthood in ways that deviate from prominent age norms."
0,"In this article we probe the interplay between public and private music consumption using a large-scale survey of the Flemish population in Belgium We analyze whether public and private music consumption have different correlates and to what extent there is convergence between the genres that people listen to at home and at concerts Results show that music consumption is positively related to all indicators of cultural capital educational attainment, enrolment in arts classes and public participation of the parents The effects are strongest for high-brow genres such as classical and opera and diminish for middle-brow and low-brow genres such as world/traditional music or pop/rock Cultural capital is more important for public participation than for private consumption This suggests that not only information processing capacity is involved when attending concerts, but also social barriers such as familiarity with the rules of decorum and network homophily Omnivorousness in music consumption is especially situated in the private sphere"
0,"Recent research suggests that the use of monetary sanctions as a supplementary penalty in state and federal criminal courts is expanding, and that their imposition creates substantial and deleterious legal debt. Little is known, however, about the factors that influence the discretionary imposition of these penalties. This study offers a comprehensive account of the role socio-cultural factors, especially race and ethnicity, have in this institutional sanctioning process. We rely on multilevel statistical analysis of the imposition of monetary sanctions in Washington State courts to test our theory. The theoretical framework emphasizes the need to treat race and ethnicity as complex cultural categories, the meaning and institutional effects of which may vary across time and space. Findings indicate that racialized crime scripts, such as the association of Latinos with drugs, affect defendants whose wrong-doing is stereotype congruent. Moreover, all individuals accused of committing racially and ethnically stigmatized offenses in racialized contexts may experience the courtesy stigma that flows from racialization. We find that race and ethnicity are not just individual attributes but cultural categories that shape the distribution of stigma and the institutional consequences that flow from it."
0,"Studies of intergenerational conflicts in immigrant families tend to focus on how the children are constrained by the social norms of the sending society that their parents impose on them and how such constraints impact the second-generations psychological well-being. This article, in contrast, examines intergenerational conflicts from the first-generations standpoint. Based on a qualitative study of Taiwanese immigrants and their children, this article highlights the importance of the first-generations cultural identification in intergenerational dynamics. During intergenerational conflicts in Taiwanese immigrant families, the mothers are often accused by their children of being too Taiwanese. This accusation often engenders enormous anxiety and distress among the mothers. Taiwanese immigrant women eager to show their Americaness to their children, but at the same time, these women still want to maintain their authority and controlling power as Taiwanese parents. Taiwanese immigrant women, therefore, struggle back and forth between two systems of culture, seeking appropriate guidance and legitimizations for their parenting behavior. These mothers shifting cultural identity not only has become their major parenting dilemma, but also illustrates the complex dynamics between the two generations."
0,"With continued cost increases as well as demands for charitable donations and economic subsidies, universities are concerned with public relations and political legitimacy. The latter are fostered by the Model Minority Myth which implicitly asserts the moral superiority of universities and their graduates by condemning American society in general and the white working class in particular as being racist. Despite its intellectual and empirical limitations, the Model Minority Myth persists because it promotes the political power of universities in the current era of increasing inequality and the rising exploitation of the working class that are fostered by educational credentialism."
0,"This paper examines how issues of feminism, marriage, resistance, and power are interrelated.  In exploring the conceptualization of marriage as a patriarchal structure and studying how patriarchal power is experienced and resisted in marriage, I uncover how feminists make sense of their simultaneous location within marital discourse and feminist discourse of resistance.  I look at the means of resistance feminists employ while remaining married.  Finally, I discuss whether we need a new conception of marriage or if marriage continues to operate as a patriarchal structure of oppression.  Using both qualitative and quantitative data, I argue that marriage is a structure in a state of transition from a patriarchal structure to one of shared resistance to patriarchy.  I find that men have become partners and resist the domination of patriarchal power alongside women.  Resistance occurs in crossing traditional gender boundaries inside the home and in the paid labor force.  Social networks play a large role in resistance strategies.  Several other themes emerged from the data indicating there are several paths of resistance and several forms of disciplinary power.  Finally, I find evidence to suggest that way marriage is structured and experienced is changing.  The result is an expanded conception of marriage."
0,"As the number of charter schools in the U.S. continues to grow, social scientists have focused their attention on the implications of their growth for academic performance and for educational inequalities.  Much of the existing research examines the number of charter schools in a state or district, or compares charter schools’ average characteristics with those of public schools.  Less often studied is the variety of charter schools being proposed, some of which are denied and some approved by state and district gatekeepers.  This paper employs a social movements perspective to analyze the frames employed by educational entrepreneurs and local leaders in successful and unsuccessful charter school applications in multiple Florida school districts.  We identify four major frames that differ in their proposed curricula, target populations, and overarching educational philosophies.  In the counties studied to date, charters targeted directly toward at-risk or disadvantaged students were the least likely to be approved.  Surprisingly, whether the applicants came from grass-roots entrepreneurs or well-known local leaders appears unrelated to charter application success."
0,"This article investigates homeowners' perceptions of race and class within a racially integrated neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland. Forty-two semi-structured interviews were completed with 59 white homeowners between September 2005 and September 2006. Adding a social class component to Bonilla-Silva's (2006) color-blind racism perspective, I ask if white homeowners in a racially-integrated neighborhood accept a color-blind worldview, or if they have an alternate framework for understanding race. Akin to O'Brien's antiracists (2001), there was a range of rejection of color-blindness, from selective to reflexive race cognizance. Most homeowners recognized the institutional basis of racial inequality and their own white privilege. However, many conflated race and class and argued that it was really class differences that caused racial differences. While many supported more racial integration, most rejected class integration in the neighborhood. This paradoxical set of attitudes will most likely continue to be an obstacle to the maintenance of racially integrated neighborhoods."
0,"This Presidential Address develops a sociological concept of citizenship, particularly substantive citizenship, as fundamentally a matter of belonging, including recognition by other members of the community. In this conception, citizenship is not simply a fixed legal status, but a fluid status that is produced through everyday practices and struggles. Historical examples illustrate the way in which boundaries of membership are enforced and challenged in everyday interactions. The experience of undocumented immigrant college students is particularly illuminating. These students occupy a position of liminal legality, which transcends fixed categories such as legal and illegal. As they go about their daily lives, their standing is affirmed in some settings and denied in others. Furthermore, the undocumented student movement, which asserts that education is a human and social right, represents a form of insurgent citizenship, one that challenges dominant formulations and offers an alternative and more inclusive conception."
0,"This paper discusses the use of post-performance interviews in a study of jazz jam sessions. These interviews are used in conjunction with a more traditional participant observation ethnography that explores how individuals are able to communicate with one another in interactions that do not make use of language. By recording the performances of musicians at jam sessions, then interviewing one of those musicians while listening to the recording, I am able to uncover important aspects of how musicians collaborate successfully. Extending this technique of listening or watching recordings of informants with those informants may prove fruitful in gaining fuller understanding of the constitution of social action in a variety of situations."
0,"Available theories concerning interdisciplinary collaborations tend to focus heavily on the cognitive dimension of such interchange. We propose the theoretical construct of “shared socio-emotional-cognitive platforms” to capture a broader set of conditions that enable or impede individuals to conduct interdisciplinary research together successfully. The paper elaborates on this theoretical concept, which is informed by an extensive empirical study of six research networks supported by three institutions. We first review relevant literature on interdisciplinary collaborations, and then advance a proposed definition of SSEC platforms, describing three key dimensions and the theoretical assumptions on which they stand. These dimensions are: the intellectual (most exclusively concerned with cognition); the interactional (concerned primarily with interaction, meaning-making, and group styles) and the institutional (concerned with the rules, practices and expectations of funding organizations and the academic fields). We conclude by comparing our construct with two well regarded models for understanding interdisciplinary exchange: the notion of “trading zones,” proposed by Peter Galison (1997) and that of interdisciplinary cultures,” proposed by Julie Klein (2010) to specify our constructs’ explanatory power and contribution to the field."
0,"At present, most work examining the well-documented relationship between social inequality and body size treats fatness as an effect, caused either by some factor that determines weight and social class simultaneously, or by social class itself. However, the relationship between weight and social inequality is more complex than these explanations suggest. Recent studies by John Cawley (2004) and Charles Baum and William Ford (2004) suggest that fatness is often a contributor to inequality, not merely an effect."
0,"The goal of this paper is to connect the macro-level processes of the global economy to the local processes of civil society. More specifically, we explore the impact of certain dimensions of globalization on two aspects of civil society; corruption and civil unrest. We begin with a theoretical discussion of the mechanisms by which these global and local processes are linked. Next, a series of quantitative cross-national analyses are presented that find both beneficial and deleterious effects of these global processes on civil society. We close with case studies of two countries, Argentina and Thailand, which give substance to these cross-national findings."
0,"This paper uses the theoretical and analytical resources of critical theory to explore the processes and conflicts over efforts to present tragic events as spectacles, focusing on a case study of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans.  Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent government response have intensified uncertainty and unpredictability, disclosed a new vulnerability in U.S. cities, and showed how a predicted disaster could wreck havoc within the U.S. economy and political system.  I first examine the ways in which the logic of spectacle and entertainment permeate a major disaster like Katrina.  Next, I investigate how media coverage and political commentary on Katrina insinuates its own immanent critique of racial and class divisions in U.S. society.  Finally, I draw attention to how critical tendencies are immanent to the commodification process itself, in the form of disaster tourism and the production of Katrina souvenirs that embrace spectacle to criticize federal policy and build global awareness of New Orleanss plight. Overall, my goal is to show how the category of immanent critique can play an important role in drawing out the implications of disaster-as-spectacle, illustrating the intersection of race and class in U.S. society, and highlighting the multidimensional, conflictual, and contradictory character of spectacles."
0,"Life insurance, which manifests a particular form of rationality and emerged in a particular cultural and institutional setting in the European context, has been brought to China at the conjunction of China's transformation from a socialist to a market economy and the global expansion of capitalist enterprises. It is something new to the Chinese population under the Communist regime. How do life insurers introduce this ""something new"" and create a market in the Chinese context? This paper presents an empirical case of how Euro-American life insurers, together with newly emerged local competitors, create a life insurance market in a Chinese context, and examines the role of culture in market formation. It is based on 14 months of ethnographic research on four different life insurance companies in Shanghai during the summer of 2000 and the academic year of 2001-2002. The findings show that the foreign players endeavor to impose on the locals a new ideology with a set of beliefs, values and practices embedded in the nature of life insurance as a modern risk management. The local competitors, on the other hand, align with the local buyers to transcribe this ""something new"" into ""something familiar"" according to the local cultural repertoires. I argue that culture matters not as an exogenous factor but as a constraint circumscribing appropriate actions and as a resource legitimating and making sense of the new economic practice in creating a market."
0,"Religious participation is linked to overall satisfaction among both married and unmarried couples in urban America. Less is known about what may account for the association between religious participation and relationship quality. We explore this issue using data from the first two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Relationship-related behaviors (e.g., temperance) and relationship-specific behaviors (e.g., affection) can each account for the association between church attendance and relationship quality. Furthermore, religious participation appears to be more tightly linked to men's perceptions of relationship quality than women's. "
0,"Ugandas success in the HIV prevalence rate decline is well documented in the literature.  Although studies pertaining to the impact of the ABC of HIV in Uganda are lacking, some scholars attribute this decline to the ABC strategy that stands for abstinence (A), being faithful to one sex partner (B), and using a condom (C).  Other scholars dispute the success of this strategy in reducing the HIV prevalence rate in Uganda.  With the focus on university students, is the ABC of HIV appears to be the solution to prevent infection among the youth?  Based on data recently collected in Uganda (2007), this study looks at university students sexual behavior and the ABC strategy influential factors.  Findings in this study may shed light on the implications of the ABC of HIV strategy.  Some of the questions answered in this study include: What are the social normative sexual behaviors of university students in Uganda?  Should variations in sexual behaviors of university students be attributed to the ABC program?  What agencies have been influential in shaping the students sexual behavior?  Frequency and cross tabulation phi statistical techniques are utilized to analyze the demographic percentage distribution patterns and associations of variables that predict ABC behavior.  In addition, logistic regression is employed to further isolate agencies such as religion, parents, schools, and media that may have influenced the ABC behavior.  The cross tabulation results reveal that the largest percentage of those that support abstinence is that of the younger respondents (78%) and females (71%).  On the other hand, more males (32%) indicate having more than one sex partner as compared to females (21%).  The majority of the respondents (86%) indicate that religion has been the biggest influence in shaping their attitudes towards ABC behavior, followed by fear of AIDS (84%), and parenthood (83%).  Overall, the effect of ABC on sexual behavior among university students is minimal because 91% of the 299 respondents indicated that they are single but had sex.  Twenty percent of the respondents indicated to have more than one sex partner.  Moreover, 61% indicated that they never or sometimes use a condom."
0,"This paper reports results from a unique experiment conducted in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to gauge the effect of question format on men's reports of contraceptive use at last sexual intercourse. Respondents received separate questions about their own and their partners' contraceptive use or one combined question about either partner's contraceptive use. We examine whether receiving separate questions, as opposed to one combined question, is related to higher reports of using any contraceptive method, specific methods, female methods in addition to male methods, and the number of methods reported. We find that reports of any contraceptive use at last sex and use of the most common methods, condoms and the pill, were stable across question formats. However, we find significantly higher reports of withdrawal, combining male and female methods, and multiple method use among men who received the separate-question format. We also find that characteristics of the sexual experience in question condition the effect of question format on men's reports. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Research examining the determinants of fear of crime has arguably raised more questions than it has answered. This exploratory study addresses one of the compelling questions that remains unanswered: what is the role of ethnicity, both at the community and individual levels, in understanding variation in fear of crime? Guided by racial or minority group threat theory, we examine the relative sizes of both the Black and Latino populations as indicators of minority group threat to determine their role in understanding individual fear of crime in a city where Latinos represent a much larger proportion of the population than Blacks (Miami-Dade County, Florida). Furthermore, the race and ethnic backgrounds of the respondents are also considered to evaluate their role in understanding variation in the fear of crime. Using both Census tract-level data and data collected from a NIDA sponsored grant that was part of a larger study about physically disabled residents, our findings reveal that in Miami-Dade County where Blacks are highly segregated from whites, the relative size of the Latino population is a predictor of fear of crime among white residents. Implications of this finding are considered, including a call for more nuanced research focusing on the predictors of fear of crime within multiethnic communities. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Large numbers of foreign-born residents in the United States mean that many people receive at least part of their education abroad. Despite this fact, our understanding of nativity differences in the success of adults and their children is based on research that does not empirically consider variation in the benefits to schooling depending on where it is received. We use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) to examine: (a) whether the socioeconomic and cognitive returns to education depend on whether it is received in the U.S. or abroad; and (b) whether schooling location partially accounts for nativity differences in these returns. We find that the returns to schooling are generally largest for adults who receive at least some of their highest level of education in the U.S. The beneficial effects of U.S. schooling are more pronounced at higher levels of educational attainment. Schooling location accounts for a sizeable fraction of the lower socioeconomic and cognitive returns of the foreign-born, relative to natives; some meaningful differences remain, however. In addition, the higher cognitive skills of the children of foreign-born adults remain unexplained. Although we cannot distinguish among the possible pathways underlying these associations (e.g., school quality, transferability of credentials, the timing of immigration) our findings suggest the importance of considering factors related to schooling location as predictors of socioeconomic and cognitive success in the United States.

0,"This article extends previous work on family structure and children's education by conceptualizing migration as a distinct form of family disruption that reduces parental input but brings substantial economic benefits through remittances. It examines the multiple and countervailing effects of migration on schooling in the context of substantial migration and limited educational opportunities for blacks in South Africa. The receipt of remittances substantially increases black children's school attendance, but has no such effect for whites. The effect for blacks is in part attributable to improved household economic conditions that increase household educational spending and reduce the demand for child labor. We also find a negative effect of parental absence due to migration, but it is largely cushioned by inflows of remittances. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score methods and contextual fixed-effect modeling suggest that the beneficial effect of remittances is relatively robust. We find further that remittances help ameliorate inter-familial socioeconomic inequality in schooling. Finally, we evaluate possible temporal changes and show that the positive and equalizing effects of remittances persisted during and after the apartheid regime. We conclude that labor migration and remittances, as institutionalized family strategies adopted by many blacks, help reconfigure structural opportunities in the educational stratification process in South Africa."
0,"Despite the image of a jury trial, most criminal cases in the UK appear to be resolved by means of  plea bargaining.   Despite the perennial controversy it engenders, plea bargaining is gaining acceptance in Britain recently.  This paper explores how plea bargaining arose historically out of the highly discretionary practices of prosecution and the criminal process under the common law and, in particular, how it interplays with mandatory sentencing schemes.  It examines Lord Woolfs recent proposals that would expand opportunities for the practice in the UK.  Drawing on the authors own research into how plea bargaining originated and then changed in response to new social contexts, the author considers some implications for justice."
0,"Despite a number of contemporary theoretical works in sociology and moral philosophy arguing that the project of modern selfhood is necessarily a deeply moral endeavor, there are few empirical studies examining the specific ways in which social actors construct moral selves and lives. Utilizing ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, this article examines how a group of adult Muslim converts in Missouri produced new moral selves in and through the use of embodied religious practices. Drawing on the theoretical insights of Bourdieu, I demonstrate how the embodied religious practices of ritual prayer, fasting and covering formed within converts the moral dispositions, or habitus, associated with becoming a 'good Muslim.""."
0,"Quantitative scholarship on civil wars has long debated whether ethnic diversity breeds armed conflict. We go beyond this debate and show that highly diverse societies are not more conflict prone. Rather states characterized by certain ethnopolitical configurations of power are more likely to experience violent conflict. First, armed rebellions are more likely to challenge states that exclude large portions of the population on the basis of ethnic background. Second, when a large number of competing elites share power in a segmented state, the risk of violent infighting increases. Third, incohesive states with a short history of direct rule are more likely to experience secessionist conflicts. We test these hypotheses for all independent states since 1945 using the new Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) data set. Cross-national analysis demonstrates that ethnic politics is as powerful and robust in predicting civil wars as is a country level of economic development. Using multinomial logit regression, we show that rebellion, infighting, and secession result from high degrees of exclusion, segmentation, and incohesion, respectively. More diverse states, on the other hand, are not more likely to suffer from violent conflict."
0,"In our increasingly mobile society, transitions are often made in search of opportunity, yet to the detriment of social ties to others. This study draws upon a life course perspective, focusing specifically on the timing and context of transitions, to explore how educational transitions affect students' academic trajectory with national longitudinal data. Findings suggest that students who transition to high school alone are resilient when they are more popular or involved in extracurricular activities. For students who transfer during high school, higher achieving students have lower academic outcomes than classmates who stay with the collective, while low-achieving transfer students benefit academically by changing schools. Findings provide insight into ways that resilience can occur in the midst of life transitions, and for whom, which may help alleviate risk and prevent the accumulation of disadvantage."
0,"Social scientists, international aid organizations, governments, and religious groups have conducted extensive research concerning the effectiveness of long-term humanitarian aid.  However, there is little research concerning the effectiveness of short-term humanitarian aid.  This project is centered on the short-term trips that are sent to Cameroon by a small, U.S. based nonprofit that supports an orphanage in Northwest Cameroon.  The purpose of this research project was to identify the issues involved in evaluating short-term humanitarian aid including defining effectiveness, determining unmet needs for evaluation, and exploring the benefits and drawbacks of implementing more formal evaluation methods.  The results of a qualitative analysis of the data revealed that both the orphanage and organization are aware of dependency and dominance issues, but there is a mutual understanding of the benefits of having a dominant organization work with the orphanage toward goals of independence.  Delivering deep and long-lasting happiness and offering long-term support is an important part of short-term trip effectiveness.  Structured goals and the willingness to honestly evaluate short-term trips will enable better evaluation, and the tools used in evaluation must address not only tangible effects but also intangible effects such as improved morale or spiritual development.  This project serves as a starting point for future research by identifying some of the key issues and questions involved in evaluating the effectiveness of short-term humanitarian aid."

0,"Examining public opinion data from a 2007 survey of Los Angeles, the authors consider racial and ethnic variation in perceptions of race relations across neighborhoods in various contexts of demographic composition and change. Using several measures of ethnic diversity, the authors examine whether racial attitudes differ depending on the demographic mix at the census tract level, and if the relative importance of ethnicity and other individual characteristics varies depending on the proportion, ratio, or diversity of ethnic groups within tracts. Only among African Americans do they find a consistent impact of racial/ethnic identity on perception of race relations, although such attitudes do not vary within various measures of neighborhood diversity. The results suggest limitations to the assumed significance-either positive or negative-of neighborhood diversity on individuals of various races and ethnicities."
0,"This research investigates how family events in adult children's lives influence the timing of their parents' financial transfers. We draw on retrospective data collected by the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and use event history models to study the effects of marriage, divorce and childbirth on the receipt of large gifts from parents. We find increased chances of receiving real estate at marriage and in subsequent years, at childbirth, but not in the event of divorce. Large gifts of money are received in the years of marriage and divorce, but not at childbirth. Our findings indicate that parental gifts are triggered by adult children's economic need, but also point to a plurality of transfer motives and meanings for parents, adult children and their relationships."
0,"Ground-level air pollution has serious effects on the natural environment and human health, but it has not received the same attention in the sociological literature as the greenhouse gases polluting the upper atmosphere. To address questions about the effects of social structural forces on environmental impacts, we analyze cross-national time-series data (1990-2000) to assess influences on the emission of ground-level air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Drawing on human ecological theory, we move beyond previous analyses by assessing demographic effects on pollution emissions in a nuanced way by dividing population into the number of households and average household size. We found that the number of households has a greater effect on SO2 emissions than average household size. This suggests that the effect of population on the environment is not simply due to its size and growth, but also to its distribution across households. The difference we found has important implications, since the global growth rate in the number of households is greater than the growth rate in population. Furthermore, while the population growth rate in less developed nations is over four times that in developed nations, the household growth rate is only double. This finding suggests that developed nations will contribute more to air pollution in the coming years than would be assumed based on population growth alone."

Democracy pays a heavy price when its members are emotionally illiterate, where emotional littering is rampant. This paper explores the interfaces between affective life and social processes. After discussing different ways of measuring emotional intelligence and its impact on democratic polity, the paper introduces the Emotional Template Matrix (ETM) analysis, a self-assessment tool designed to track emotional wellness, and describes the ETM Survey based on this methodology. The last section of this paper summarizes preliminary results of the ETM Survey."
0,"The implications of recent weight gain trends for widening social disparities in body weight in the United States are unclear. Using an intersectional approach to studying inequality, and the longitudinal and nationally representative American's Changing Lives study (1986-2001/2002), we examine social disparities in body mass index trajectories during a time of rapid weight gain in the United States. Results reveal complex interactive effects of gender, race, socioeconomic position and age, and provide evidence for increasing social disparities, particularly among younger adults. Most notably, among individuals who aged from 25-39 to 45-54 during the study interval, low-educated and low-income black women experienced the greatest increase in BMI, while high-educated and high-income white men experienced the least BMI growth. These new findings highlight the importance of investigating changing disparities in weight intersectionally, using multiple dimensions of inequality as well as age, and also presage increasing BMI disparities in the U. S. adult population."
0,"How can individuals who are considered status-disadvantaged according to the cultural beliefs of the larger society, yet earn positions as leaders in task groups, command authority?  This paper suggests that women (status-disadvantaged) as leaders who increasingly find it difficult to get things done may use trust placed in them by others in authority positions as a cue for their leadership effectiveness.  Results from an experiment using mixed and same-sex partnerships showed that status-disadvantaged leaders, who are trusted by others in authority positions, are more influential than status-equal leaders.  That influence extends to behavior in task oriented groups, however beliefs about their legitimacy as leaders is not significantly different.  Beliefs about competence are dependent upon whether ones partner is status-disadvantaged or status-equal (the external status order) but not upon trust cues.  Men working with women may accept their influence in the short term when they receive trust cues underscoring the women as leaders but trust cues do not provide legitimacy for women in leadership positions.  Not only are they viewed by men as less competent, but they are also seen as less considerate, a documented backlash against women leaders (Carli 1990; Rudman and Glick 1990).  Trust cues fail to confirm the legitimacy of their leadership attainment and suggest a curtailment of their leadership effectiveness."
0,"In this study, the author uses 25 years of data taken from the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth to examine the relationship between family life course statuses and transitions and work-related health limitations. The author uses a detailed set of statuses and transitions that include marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and parenthood. The measures of health used tap health limitations in the kind and amount of work that can be performed. Using a fixed-effects estimator for dichotomous outcomes, the author finds that marriage is positively related to the health of men but negatively related to the health of women. The author also finds that parenthood is not related to the health of men but is positively related to the health of women. The results also indicate that statuses are more important for determining health limitations than are transitions."
0,"This article returns to a classic question of political economy: the zero-sum conflict between capital and labor over the division of the national income pie. A detailed description of labor's share of national income in 16 industrialized democracies from 1960 to 2005 uncovers two long-term trends: an increase in labor's share in the aftermath of World War II, followed by a decrease since the early 1980s. I argue that the working class's relative bargaining power explains the dynamics of labor's share, and I model inter- and intra-class bargaining power in the economic, political, and global spheres. Time-series cross-section equations predicting the short- and long-term determinants of labor's share support most of my theoretical arguments and the main findings are robust to alternative specifications. Results suggest that the common trend in the dynamics of labor's share of national income is largely explained by indicators for working-class organizational power in the economic (i.e., unionization and strike activity) and political (i.e., government civilian spending) spheres, working-class structural power in the global sphere (i.e., southern imports and foreign direct investments), and indirectly by an indicator for working-class integration in the intra-class sphere (i.e., bargaining centralization)."

Late 20th century blurring of fact and fiction in U.S. culture and the academy, questions of memory, the role of irrationality and emotions in narrative construction, and the politics of feminist methods are examined as issues in understanding different kinds of bias and in questioning the role and concept of bias in qualitative methods."
0,"Social movement theorists belonging to both the resource mobilization school and the framings school tend to define social movements as phenomenon that actively pursue political goals, despite disagreements over whether cognitive conceptions or resources are more important in the successful attainment of these goals. The following paper seeks to enter into a dialogue with these two traditions by examining the possibility that social movements may contain features that are not overtly political, or themselves be entirely unconcerned with political goals, and yet still produce politically relevant consequences. Borrowing loosely from mechanisms for the generation of discourse developed by Foucault, the paper conceptualizes social movements as unique loci of discourse interaction, which both generate and are sustained by an incipient new discourse. The discourse created therein, furthermore, is important due to its cognitive aspect, which constrains the thinking of individuals within the movement, and due to its communicative aspect, which allows it to be spread outside of the movement through the simple act of communication (thus breaking free of the initial locus). This new discourse is further relevant, because it effects which aspects of reality are communicated in inter-personal interaction, thus severely constraining which action oriented frames can be constructed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the possibility of a division of labor within social movements, in which discourse is generated via discursive interaction in several loci, and subsequently woven together in other movements before becoming framed in a politically relevant manner. The paper ends with several implications of the importance of discourse in formulating a more complete understanding of social movements, as it relates to generating more nuanced theories of power. The case study of the 1960s in the United States is employed to highlight these phenomena."
0,"This paper argues that accounts of the welfare state as a form of labor market regulation fail to note the long history of the regulation of marriage and family life through US welfare policy.  Feminist critiques of labor market approaches have implicitly accepted the emphasis upon welfare as a mechanism for labor market regulation.  However, such a focus cannot explain current pro-marriage initiatives in the US.  Accordingly, this paper traces the long history of the US regulation of family, so that we can better understand how precedent has led to contemporary regulation, and what is distinct about current welfare initiatives.  By replacing the framework of welfare as labor market regulation, with the Foucauldian account offered by French sociologist Jacques Donzelot, I seek to explain why contemporary legislation is focusing upon the production of nuclear families and marriage.  I argue that American welfare has regulated poor families for over a century, however, the definition of a problem family, along with state interventions offered, have shifted over time.  Consequently, I suggest that the history of US familial welfarism can be conceptualized into four eras of family regulation; Family Breakup (1820-1890); Family Preservation (1890-1962); Nuclear Family Support (1962-1996); and Nuclear Family Governance (1996-present).   Such an analysis also suggests a new relationship between poor families and the state in the context of contemporary neoliberal governance."
0,"Two groups of sociologists take money as their central concern.  Scholars of inequality focus on the distribution of economic resources while many economic sociologists focus on the constitutive and regulatory roles of culture in monetary transactions.  In this paper I examine the interplay between these two dimensions of economic process by focusing on the particular case of South African burial societies; informal groups organized by members to mutually save for the cost of funerals.  I take a mixed-methods approach, drawing on survey data and in-depth interviews, which allows me to examine the scope, stratification, and meaning of membership.  I find that far from being a marginal part of the economy, membership in informal burial societies is widespread.  Further, while burial society membership is overwhelmingly concentrated among blacks, there is little stratification in membership by income, education, or access to formal finance.  Indeed, burial society members are more likely to hold formal financial products than non-members.  Drawing on qualitative interviews, I show that burial societies do far more than fill a simple savings or insurance function.  Rather, burial societies help members to create a good reputation and provide an important means by which economic action is used to do relational work."

0,"The upswing in economic inequality that has affected a number of advanced industrial societies in the late 20th century has been particularly conspicuous in the United States. The authors explore its causes using data on the distribution of family income in 3,098 U. S. counties in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The authors build a model of within-county income inequality that assumes that distribution processes involving labor market and sociodemographic variables operate primarily at the county level and those involving the political and institutional context operate primarily at the state level. Multi-level methods are used to distinguish county cross-sectional, state cross-sectional, and longitudinal effects on inequality. The authors find that, when features of the state-level institutional and political context are associated with inequality, these effects are larger longitudinally than cross-sectionally. A range of other factors, including economic development, labor force changes, shifts in the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the labor force, educational expansion, and urbanization are found to have comparatively large effects, both longitudinally and cross-sectionally."
0,"This study investigated the links between marijuana use trajectories and marijuana abuse/dependence (DSM-IV) using five waves of data from 718 North American Indigenous adolescents between 10 and 17 years from eight reservations sharing a common language and culture. Growth mixture models indicated that 15% of youth began using by 11-12 years of age and that another 20% began shortly thereafter. These early users had odds of abuse/dependence 6.5 times larger than abstainers. Girls were also unexpectedly found to be particularly at risk of early use, and this did not reflect other background and psychosocial factors, including friend use. While the timing, patterns, and consequences of use were similar to those reported for alcohol use previously, the social influences on use differed in important ways. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Although interest in religion among young people has increased markedly, research examining the impact of religion on child development has been sorely lacking. This study is the first of its kind to use nationally representative data to explore the influence of religion on several different dimensions of psychological development and social adjustment in early childhood. Data from the Spring 2000 wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) are analyzed to explore how child development is shaped by individual parents' religiosity, the religious homogamy of couples, and the family's religious environment. Significant religious effects are observed across a range of child development domains and are manifested for both parents' ratings and teachers' ratings of youngsters. Parental, couple, and familial religion are linked with youngsters' pro-social behavior. However, religion can undermine child development when it is a source of conflict among families. The investigation concludes with a specification of implications and directions for future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

This article examines this question taking repressive environments and threat as an important case in point. Drawing on primary and secondary data sources, I offer comparative insights on resistance group dynamics and perceptions of threat in three Nazi death camps-Sobibor, Treblinka, and Auschwitz-between 1941 and 1945. Prisoners formed resistance groups at each camp, but collective revolt occurred in only certain cases: when the collective perception of threat at a given camp was viewed as both immediate and lethal. The interpretation of changing, threatening conditions, and an understanding of structural and interactional opportunities for group identity and tactical strategizing, are vital for understanding collective action in repressive environments. I conclude by discussing these lessons pertaining to threat and their implications for repressive contexts and broader social movement theorizing."
0,"Organizational studies have the potential to develop stronger sociological explanations of mental health by demonstrating the connections that exist between (a) the larger social structure, (b) organizational processes, and (c) individual consumer experiences and outcomes. In this paper I present findings from a qualitative-comparative case study of four programs that followed the same model for serving formerly homeless consumers with dually diagnosed mental health and substance use disorders. I collected data from administration, consumers, and front-line staff at each program. My analysis, guided by the concepts of institutional isomorphism and loose coupling, demonstrate how and why implementation of the model varied at the four programs and the effects these variations had at the consumer-level. These findings point to (1) program flexibility and (2) consumer education as being the two most important dimensions of programming that affected consumer experiences and outcomes. I present a typology based on these dimensions that can be used to guide future organizational mental health research."
0,"This paper analyzes the central issues surrounding a Housing First and Harm Reduction model implemented by the Chicago Housing for Health Partnership (CHHP). CHHP was established in 2002 by a diverse group of health care, respite and housing providers and serves chronically medically ill homeless adults who have been recently hospitalized. In this paper we outline the history of the CHHP model as a Housing First program. As CHHP evolved it became apparent to the organizations that a harm reduction model was necessary to effectively treat their target population. The introduction of a harm reduction philosophy initially required a plasticity of the concept in order to effectively integrate it into the system and promote its use among its members. However, over the course of the program the more flexible concept of harm reduction didnt work and it ultimately led to the reorganization of the CHHP program and a more hardened or agreed upon concept of what harm reduction entails. We base our conclusions upon a year long study of the CHHP system and its participants and stakeholders including agency heads, program directors, case managers, consumers, and CHHP/lead agency staff."
0,"We utilize the 2000 Equal Employment Opportunity file of the US. Census and various secondary resources to determine if party control, union density and states' anti-discrimination and family leave policy legacies affect levels of occupational sex segregation across large counties. Our findings offer a puzzle to political sociologists because two theories that are typically pitted against one another (Power Resource Theory vs. Liberal Economic Theory) predict and result in comparable outcomes. Indeed, as suggested by Social Democratic Theory, the sub-national United States have lower levels of occupational sex segregation when the Democratic Party and unions are strong, and policies are the mechanism through which these states maintain low occupational sex segregation. Yet, interestingly, as suggested by Liberal Economic Theory, occupational sex segregation is also low when unions and the Democratic Party are both weak, suggesting that unfettered market capitalism redresses socio-economic inequalities."
0,"This research addresses a largely ignored question in the study of terror: who are its likely victims? An answer was sought through analysis of comprehensive data on civilian victims of terror in Israel from 1993 through 2003. The chances of being killed in seemingly random terror attacks were found unequally distributed in Israeli society, but the weaker sectors were not the most vulnerable. This pattern may be attributed to the perpetration of most terror attacks in public places, where members of underprivileged groups are less likely to be. Paradoxically, ethnic segregation, gender and other forms of social exclusion and inequality may have helped to protect marginalized social groups from the risk of terror victimization."
0,"With data from respondents in Nizhni Novgorod, Russia, we assess assumptions from self-control theory that attractiveness of criminal acts (motivation) does not vary enough among people to challenge the import of self-control and that failure to anticipate and take into account long range costs of misbehavior represents the mediating link between self-control and criminal conduct.  Although the magnitude of associations between self-control and indicators of criminal behavior is about the same as in other studies, they are largely overshadowed by criminal attraction.  Consistent with that, failure to anticipate long range costly consequences does not appear to be the mediating link between self-control and criminal behavior.  In fact, sanction fear is modestly and significantly related to the crime measures independently of self-control, though sanction fear also appears to be influenced by criminal attraction.   The results suggest that in the production of criminal behavior attraction to criminal behavior may be more important than controls inhibiting criminal impulses and that effects of low self-control on criminal conduct may not be indirect through the mediating mechanism of failure to anticipate long range consequences, but instead may be direct, reflecting inability to avoid anticipated costs."
0,"While previous theories have detailed that identities can be both racial and ethnic, exactly how these dual identities are created is not detailed. In this paper, we explore how structural racial identity processes (such as altercasting) coincides with agentic processes of ethnic self-selection can create these dual – or shared – identities. Mainly drawing on literature relating to the racialization and ethnicization of Latinos, we propose that panethnic identities can be both imposed and selected. The goal of this paper is to provide a theoretical basis for this process, highlighting how theories in both psychological and sociological social psychology can add to the discussion of the creation of panethnic Latino/a identities. We shortly discuss methodological and theoretical implications of this work."
0,"This paper attempts to show the logic and mechanism in which extreme nationalism become possible. Through the analysis of the difference between the state religion policy and the national moral (kokumin dotoku) policy in Meiji Japan, I find why the first plan failed while the second functioned as the basis of national ideology such effectively. In short, the governments shift of policy in modern Japan can be described as shift from religion to civil religion in Rousseaus term as a basis of national ideology. Though there are many similarities between religion and morality, morality is specifically a matter of practice and secularity. And that specific character was the very advantage that the national moral had for the basis of national ideology. This case analysis provides one historical evidence to show that no matter how eccentric it appears, nationalism cannot be explained as fanatic cult. Rather, national ideology requires a logic and a mechanism to be diffused and reproduced between people."
0,"This paper explores how evangelical Christian parents construct “obedience” within a Christian ethos of discipline.  We have observed three constructions of “obedience” within this ethos: 1) Zero-Tolerance Obedience in which children must obey their parents’ commands immediately, 2) .Negatively-Framed Obedience, in which parents frame children’s disobedience as sin that reaps consequences (i.e. punishment), and 3) Positively-Framed Obedience, in which parents frame obedience as a positive virtue that “pleases” parents and/or God."
0,"In the last few years, there's been a burgeoning interest among sociologists in narrative, narrative analysis, stories, and storytelling. This movement is multivocal and constituted by diverse representational heritages and strategies. The ""narrative turn"" has emerged in the context of a discipline in theoretical and political crisis and in calls for self-reflexive modes of qualitative inquiry that grapple with the intersection of biography and history in society. In this paper, we review these trends and advance our vision of a ""storytelling sociology."" Storytelling sociology views lived experience as constructed, at least in part, by the stories people tell about it. Stories are not merely ways of telling others about ourselves but of constructing our identities, of finding purpose and meaning in our lives. Storytelling sociology is theoretically minimalist, seeking meaning in the narrative itself. Storytelling sociology encourages writing that experiments with different forms of representation and that seeks engagement with the world beyond academe. The measure of ""truth"" in this project is not judged by conventional postivist standards of validity and reliability but by the power of stories to evoke the vividness of lived experience."
0,"Model uncertainty is pervasive in quantitative research. Classical statistical theory assumes that only one (true) model is applied to a sample of data. In practice, however, researchers do not know which exact model specification is best. Modern computing power allows researchers to estimate a huge number of plausible models, yet only a few of these estimates are published. The result is a severe asymmetry of information between analyst and reader The applied modeling process produces a much wider range of estimates than is suggested by the usual standard errors or confidence intervals. I demonstrate this using the work of Barro and McCleary, on religion and economic growth. Small, sensible changes in their model specification produce large changes in the results: the results are inconsistent across time, and the instrumental variables strategy suffers from a weak instrument set. Also, the observed relationship between religiosity and economic growth does not hold in the West; it is largely a feature of Asian and African countries and of countries whose data is poor quality In short, empirical findings should be evaluated not just by their significance but also by their robustness to model specification. I conclude with suggestions for incorporating model uncertainty into practice and improving the transparency of social science research."
0,"At first glance they seem to have little in common. Goffman, heir to the Chicago school, has precious little to say about either power or history. Foucault, avatar of post-structuralism, wrote exclusively about these things, and moreover seems worlds apart from the terrain of symbolic interactionism. Understandably, perhaps, few scholars have spoken of them in the same breath.  In this paper I contend that a fuller appreciation of both Goffmans and Foucaults work becomes possible when we read each as seeking to appropriate the insights first generated by Durkheim, whose theory of totemism and the cult of the individual provided the touchstone for their respective theorists of the self. Extracting insights from these two theorists sheds light on the nature of ritual under contemporary society, and draws attention to the need for sociological theory on this terrain increasingly, a contested one, as the culture wars suggest."
0,"In the last three decades the world has experienced the emergence of nonviolent revolutions against dictatorial and totalitarian regimes. Despite being the earliest of these nonviolent challenges to domestic rulers, the Iranian Revolution of 1977-79 has attracted little attention from scholars of nonviolent action. The objective of this paper is twofold: to introduce researchers of nonviolent social change to the Iranian Revolution, and to identify the causal elements that helped bring about a nonviolent revolution in Iran. Religious motivation and organization, and a favorable international context are identified as some of the structural and agentic conditions that made a nonviolent challenge to the shah both possible and successful. The findings of the paper seem to indicate that nonviolence could once again become a method of struggle in contemporary Iran."

The findings show some support for the theories tested.  Theoretical implications and limitations of the study are discussed."
0,"Citizenship has become a scholarly buzzword for our times. Why? I will suggest that citizenship seems to act as a normative aspiration, a solid and active way of conceptualizing grounds for social justice. I will argue that the promise of citizenship as a frame for social justice lies in how it is a nexus of disciplinary and juridical power which foregrounds contextualized considerations of culture, society, state, and capital. I argue for a conceptualization of citizenship as membership in a necessarily political community (partially) recognized by and (partially) expressed through a state formation which can enforce rules of relation between members articulated as negative rights, positive rights, and obligations. Having thus framed citizenship, I sketch an outline of the theoretical basis for an empirical exploration of the dialectical relationship between citizenship and sexuality in North America. I conclude by illustrating the use of this framework to do a brief theoretical case study of extra-dyadic sexual practice and partnering in North America."
0,"Studies that examine the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and weight are limited because residents are not randomly distributed into neighborhoods. If associations are found between neighborhood characteristics and weight in observational studies, one cannot confidently draw conclusions about causality. We use data from the Utah Population Database (UPDB) that contain body mass index (BMI) information from all drivers holding a Utah driver license to undertake a cross-sectional analysis that compares the neighborhood determinants of BMI for youth and young adults. This analysis assumes that youth have little choice in their residential location while young adults have more choice. Our analysis makes use of data on 53,476 males and 47,069 females living in Salt Lake County in 2000. We find evidence of residential selection among both males and females when BMI is the outcome. The evidence is weaker when the outcomes are overweight or obesity. We conclude that studies that ignore the role of residential selection may be overstating the causal influence of neighborhood features in altering residents' BMI. "
0,"Latino students currently have the highest dropout rates of any population subgroup in the United States.  This paper seeks to combine the literature on language assistance classes and tracking in a multi-level modeling framework in order to find an answer to how individual and contextual variables differentially explain why Latino students drop out of high school.  I use data from the first three waves of the National Education Longitudinal Study for the Latino sub-sample of 1387 students nested within 393 schools.  My hypothesis is that Latinos who have taken language assistance classes prior to 8th grade are more likely to drop out of high school primarily due to tracking in non academic classes.  The preliminary findings suggest that language assistance classes may have a negative effect on the probability of dropping out of high school  especially for students who attend urban schools with gang conflicts.  A tentative conclusion from these results is tha t contrary to the stated hypothesis, having had taken language assistance classes prior to 8th grade may in fact arm Latino students with some skills and/or resources which deter them from eventually dropping out of high school."
0,"How do we attribute a monetary value to intangible things? This article offers a general sociological approach to this question, using the economic value of nature as a paradigmatic case, and oil spills litigations in France and the United States as real world empirical illustrations. It suggests that a full-blown sociology of economic valuation must solve three problems: the ""why,"" which refers to the general place of money as a metric for worth; the ""how,"" which refers to the specific techniques and arguments laymen and experts deploy to elicit monetary translations; and the ""then what"" or the feedback loop from monetary values to social practices and representations."
0,"The social model of disability, which claims that disablement is the result of social and physical barriers that prevent impaired persons from fully participating in society, has come to be widely accepted in the disability literature. Despite its broad success in empowering impaired individuals and fostering social movements toward disability rights, this model has been criticized for not capturing a full picture of the disablement process. The model purposively does not address individuals’ physical experiences of impairment, such as pain and fatigue. However, it is contended that these factors have lasting and real effects on the quality of impaired individuals’ lives. Additionally, the model does little to explain the process by which experiences of social and physical barriers come to shape the self. Finally, the model does not address individuals’ experiences of disability across stratified social positions. Using a symbolic interactionist frame, I examine how individuals’ experiences with physical and social barriers in society, as well as physical impairment, are mediated through the reflected appraisal process in shaping their identities as disabled/able-bodied."
0,"Fixed- and random-effects models for longitudinal data are common in sociology Their primary advantage is that they control for time-invariant omitted variables However, analysts face several issues when they employ these models One is the choice of which to apply, another is that FEM and REM models as usually implemented might be insufficiently flexible For example, the effects of variables, including the latent time-invariant variable, might change over time The latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others Lagged endogenous variables might be necessary Alternatives that move beyond the classic FEM and REM models are known, but they involve estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare This article presents a general panel model that includes the standard FEM and REM as special cases In addition it provides a sequence of nested models that provide a richer range of models that researchers can easily compare with likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics Furthermore, researchers can implement our general panel model and its special cases in widely available structural equation models software"
0,"In this paper, I estimate the effects on language skills of two characteristics of school populations: average/share and diversity, both on the ethnic and the sociocultural dimension. I use the cross-national PISA 206 data, for both 15-year-old native pupils and pupils with an immigrant background. A larger ethnic diversity of schools in secondary education hampers the educational performance of both pupils with an immigrant background and native pupils, but the negative effects are smaller in education systems with little stratification and strongest in highly stratified education systems. The sociocultural diversity of schools does not have an effect on educational performance, but these effects are positive in highly stratified educational systems and negative in hardly stratified systems. However, the average parental educational level of schools is very important for the educational performance of children, and this hardly differs between education systems. A higher share of pupils with an immigrant background in a school hampers educational performance, but if these pupils have the same regional origin (Islamic countries; non-Islamic Asian countries), a higher share of pupils with an immigrant background at that school promotes educational performance. Pupils originating from Islamic countries have substantially lower language scores than equivalent pupils with an immigrant background from other regions. This cannot be explained by the individual socioeconomic backgrounds, school characteristics, or education systems."
0,"This paper draws upon structural social psychological theories of small group dynamics to add predictive power to economic theories of discrimination. We first combine economic models of taste-based discrimination with social identity theory and hypothesize that discrimination is driven mainly by preferences or affinities that follow in-group/out-group boundaries. We also bring together status characteristics theory with economic views on information-based discrimination to alternatively hypothesize that discrimination is primarily driven by expectations of competency that are culturally linked to status characteristics. Predictions from both arguments are tested using data from the reality television show Survivor, a quasi-experimental setting that has compelling advantages for the study of discrimination. Specifically, we model the number of votes for elimination a contestant receives using sex, race, age, education, and group membership as explanatory variables. The results overwhelmingly support our integration of status characteristics theory and information-based models of discrimination. In the early episodes, when strategic considerations should lead contestants to value competency, low status individuals (women, minorities, and older contestants), receive more votes for elimination than high status contestants. However, as predicted from our refinement of information-based discrimination, this pattern is reversed in the later episodes. Here, when strategic considerations disfavor competency, it is high status contestants who are targeted more frequently. In contradiction to taste-based theories, discrimination tied to status characteristics is much more evident than voting according to in-group/out-group membership. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for contemporary theories of discrimination. "
0,"Although the positive association between religiosity and life satisfaction is well documented, much theoretical and empirical controversy surrounds the question of how religion actually shapes life satisfaction. Using a new panel dataset, this study offers strong evidence for social and participatory mechanisms shaping religion's impact on life satisfaction. Our findings suggest that religious people are more satisfied with their lives because they regularly attend religious services and build social networks in their congregations. The effect of within-congregation friendship is contingent, however, on the presence of a strong religious identity. We find little evidence that other private or subjective aspects of religiosity affect life satisfaction independent of attendance and congregational friendship."
0,"This paper explores the experiences of undocumented Latino college students in Southern California (United States). Their invisibility shaped both their autonomy at college and their inability to interact fully in the classroom and engage in classroom debates. Participants described an overwhelming feeling of fear, anxiety, and hopelessness due to the hyper hate community that surrounds the university and other societal factors. Educational resiliency and educational citizenship are concepts to better understand the participants’ experiences. We provide recommendations for universities, professors, support staff, and political action."
0,"New Immigrant Survey 2003 data are used to consider the intersection between self- and other's assessments of English proficiency. Our findings yield two important results. First, individuals who over- or under-estimate their English proficiency experience worse labor market outcomes than those whose positive self-evaluations coincide with the interviewer's. Second, our analysis of respondents with a concordant self and interviewer assessment suggests higher returns to English proficiency than when using self-assessment. We argue that, although self-assessed language proficiency dominates the literature on immigrants' well-being, this measure omits an important additional factor concerning immigrant self-perception and its concordance with the perceptions of others.

The parameters of the experiment are set according to the status characteristic and expectation states theory to measure the status of women as indicated by the choices subjects make during the experiment. The experiment was replicated in three locations (Wuhan, Beijing, and Taiwan) to determine the impact of economic development on womens status. The results indicate that economic development in Mainland China has had a detrimental effect on womens status and that democratic advances in Taiwan have not improved the status of women."
0,"How do social movements promote diversity and alternative organizational forms? We address this question by analyzing how cooperative enterprise was affected by the Grange-a leading anticorporate movement in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. State-level analyses across three industries yield three findings. First, the Grange had positive effects on cooperatives and mutuals during the nineteenth-century populist struggles over corporate capitalism. Second, these effects were stronger where corporations counter-mobilized to block challengers' political efforts. Grangers pursued economic organization as an alternative to politics and in response to blocked political access. Third, the Grange continued to foster cooperatives even as populist revolts waned. It did so, however by buffering cooperatives from problems of group heterogeneity and population change, rendering them less dependent on supportive communities and specific economic conditions. These findings advance research at the movements/organizations interface by documenting movement effects and by isolating different causal pathways through which mobilization, counter-mobilization, and political opportunity shape economic organization. The results also provide economic sociology with new evidence on how social structure moderates economic forces, and help revise institutional analyses of American capitalism by showing how cooperatives emerged as significant, rather than aberrant, elements of the US. economy."
0,"A growing literature reveals that parental divorce and marital discord can have undesirable effects on the mental health and social well-being of children, some of which extend well into adulthood. Our study augments this body of work by focusing on the interplay of divorce and discord in shaping the religious and spiritual lives of young adults. Several discrete subgroups of young adults are identified in terms of parental marital status and degree of parents marital conflict, and multiple religious and spiritual outcomes are considered. Data are taken from the National Survey on the Moral and Spiritual Lives of Young Adults from Divorced and Intact Families, a nationwide US telephone survey of approximately 1500 young adults ages 18-35 conducted in 2001. Findings confirm that persons raised by parents in intact, happy, low-conflict marriages tend to score higher on most religious and spiritual outcomes. However, offspring from divorced families and those from intact high-conflict families differ on some outcomes, but not others. Indicators of traditional institutional religious practices and beliefs appear more vulnerable to the effects of parental divorce and discord than personal spiritual beliefs and practices. Overall, findings reveal a rich but complex set of relationships between family background and religious and spiritual lives among young adults. "
0,"This research addresses a long standing puzzle in the social sciences: why are stratified social systems accepted as legitimate (the way things ""ought"" to be) by those who are advantaged and those who are disadvantaged by them? We build on previous studies of self-evaluations to explain the legitimation of inequality. The research consists of two experiments designed to test the self-evaluation theory of legitimacy. The theory proposes that structural inequality becomes legitimated when individuals' self-evaluations and the level of resources they receive are congruent. Study I examines the impact of structural power on self-evaluations. Results show that participants randomly assigned to advantaged positions in power structures earn more rewards and, as a result, develop higher self-evaluations than those randomly assigned to disadvantaged positions. Study 2 addresses the relationship between self-evaluations and legitimated structural inequality by testing competing hypotheses of legitimacy. The results partially support the self-evaluation theory and partially support competing arguments about legitimacy. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work and suggestions for future research. "
0,"Since the 1970s, sociological research on organizations has paid particular attention to the relationship between organizations and the broader fields in which they exist. However, the attention to context has frequently led to an impoverished notion of creative and strategic agency in organizational life. This paper illustrates the importance of considering agency through an analysis of natural and organic foods co-operative retailers, known as co-ops, in a changing natural products marketplace. The paper begins by outlining the new institutionalist and organizational ecology approaches to organizations research. I also examine recent criticisms about the dearth of agency in these models and offer a way to think about actors strategies that draws on research in cultural sociology. Next, I explain the relevance of co-ops for this research and describe my data and research methods. The remainder of the paper analyzes three dimensions of strategy in co-ops. I consider changes in work, management, and collective organization and argue that co-ops responses to dilemmas in these areas illustrate the role of strategy in mediating between environmental conditions and organizational behavior. These examples also show that organizational histories, cultures, and goals condition strategic responses."
0,"The Department of Homeland Security is said to be, today, one of our most important federal agencies.  Observers agree, though, that it is a dysfunctional agency whose ability to really protect the American public is deeply in doubt.  In this paper, I try to understand this apparent mismatch between critically important function and lack of real performance.  I argue that there is an analogy between Homeland Security today and atomic Civil Defense in the 1950s.  I review the history of Civil Defense and argue that its real purpose was not to protect lives but to ensure popular support for an aggressive foreign policy based on the threat that the U.S. would retaliate to aggression with atomic weapons.  Given the analogy, I discuss what that earlier experience can teach us about the (possibly covert) goals of Homeland Security today."
0,"Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, this article emphasizes the central role of poor infant health as a mechanism in the formation of early educational disparities. Results indicate that the varying prevalence of poor infant health across racial/ethnic groups explains a significant portion of the black disadvantage and a moderate portion of the Asian advantage relative to whites in math and reading skills at age four. Results also demonstrate that infant health is an equal opportunity offender across social groups as children with poor health are equally disadvantaged in terms of early cognitive development, regardless of racial/ethnic status. Overall, results indicate that health at birth has important consequences for individual educational achievement and racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive development and school readiness."
0,"This paper explores what it meant to be an Indian scientist, especially an anthropologist, in the colonial India.  It examines the structural conditions created by the British colonialism and their influence on native scholarship.  Indian scientists in all disciplines were subject to racism and discrimination (receiving significantly lower salaries, unable to hold certain posts, etc.). However, the native scientists in the newly burgeoning social sciences, especially anthropology, whose subject matter was living people rather than inanimate objects, were confronted with additional challenges because despite the obvious class and social differences, they felt an affinity and a certain sense of sameness with the people they studied. Yet, based on the positivist epistemology and methodology of the science they practiced, they were supposed to not only distance themselves from these people, but also regard them as inferior.  This put them in a deeply contradictory position, which, however, also made the inner tensions and incongruities of the colonial regime exceedingly evident and enabled them to use the egalitarian rhetoric of science to start dismantling the colonial regime through  what I called anthropologized history, i.e., a history based on the assumption that nations are natural, bounded, and mutually exclusive entities, each with their own history that can (and, indeed, need to) be pitted against histories of other comparable units.  The project of dismantling the colonial regime with the help of science was eventually successfully accomplished.  It also, however, ultimately led to dismantling of the shared life of many of the Indian Hindus and Muslims."
0,"Considerable attention has been directed at analyzing the lifestyle of retirees and how they adapt to their new stage of the life course. The literature largely treats this stage as a given and suggests Boomers (1946-1965) will retire as the preceding two generations have retired. But retirement in one's early- to mid-sixties is a relatively new stage of the life course and may soon become little more than a fond memory. The social conditions driving the changes that will keep people in the workplace longer than anticipated are examined in this article. These changes may not all be negative; indeed, there are considerable positive consequences for individuals remaining in the workforce longer. One of these is obviously the ability to remain economically vibrant. The other is that outside the workplace people have precious few social connections, and social networks are crucial for many if they are to maintain a positive self-image."
0,"In  Passion: An Essay on Personality (1986) Roberto Mangabeira Unger explores the relationship between the problems of contextuality and solidarity. On the one hand, humans are both bound to and capable of transcending their formative social and intellectual contexts, and – in part by breaking with the belief that these contexts are natural – they can create structures that allow for the “occasions and instruments of [their] own revision” (10). On the other hand, humans experience both an unlimited need for others (and their material support and acceptance and recognition) and an unlimited fear of their exploitation and depersonalization in these encounters. For Unger the “passions” are ways of negotiating these “enabling conditions of self-assertion” (simultaneously engaging with others while avoiding subjugation and depersonalization). Passion focuses on the central passions of hate (and vanity, jealousy, and envy) and love (and faith and hope). This essay explores Unger’s claim that a reciprocal causal relation exists between a frozen, naturalized contextuality and forms of solidarity that fail to realize these conditions of self-assertion, are marked by the passions of hatred (which resemble the symptoms of narcissistic personality disorders), and discourage both the “accepted vulnerability” in interpersonal relations that Unger claims is the essence of love and the “democratic experimentalism” that he sees as the hallmark of contexts routinely open to revision. I suggest that a more historical analysis of narcissism can strengthen Unger’s argument."
0,"In this paper, I explore the cultural significance of autobiographical memory and the relevance of autobiography to collective memory and a distinctly social epistemology. Taking a formal, sociocognitive approach to narrative analysis, I analyze autobiographical stories about awakening to truth in political, psychological, religious, and sexual realms of social life. Individuals use such awakening narratives to redefine their past experiences and relationships, testify to “truth,” and plot future courses of action while explaining major transformations of worldview. Despite many differences, all awakeners reconstruct their personal memories as they work to redefine some socially significant moral or political concern. Some use their autobiographical memories to shape the collective memory of a macro-level community. Others use their autobiographical memories to shape the publicly accepted social framework for individual memories pertaining to particular moral-interpersonal issues. In both cases, individuals use their autobiographical accounts to assert mnemonic authority – the authority to define or redefine past experiences, events, and social relationships that are more broadly relevant than the life of any one individual. Further, they use their life stories to express mnemonic solidarity with a new autobiographical community and define the parameters of various sociomental (cognitive and epistemic) tensions and conflicts in the world. From this perspective, autobiography serves as both a dialogical performance and a communicative action. Explicitly focusing on autobiography as an analytic domain, I advance a theoretical framework for exploring the ways individuals use personal memories to do cultural work and perform meaning by telling stories about their lives."
0,"This article examines how widely shared cultural values shape social problem construction and, in turn, can reproduce social inequality. To do so, we draw on a comparative case study of American news reporting on eating disorders and overweight/obesity between 1995 and 2005. In the contemporary United States, thinness is associated with high social status and taken as evidence of moral virtue. In contrast, fatness is linked to low status and seen as a sign of sloth and gluttony. Drawing on an original data set of news reports, we examine how such social and moral meanings of body size inform news reporting on eating disorders and overweight. We find that the news media in our sample typically discuss how a host of complex factors beyond individual control contribute to anorexia and bulimia. In that anorexics and bulimics are typically portrayed as young white women or girls, this reinforces cultural images of young white female victims. In contrast, the media predominantly attribute overweight to bad individual choices and tend to treat binge eating disorder as ordinary and blameworthy overeating. In that the poor and minorities are more likely to be heavy, such reporting reinforces social stereotypes of fat people, ethnic minorities, and the poor as out of control and lazy. While appreciation for bigger female bodies among African Americans is hailed as protecting against thinness-oriented eating disorders, this same cultural preference is partially blamed for overweight and obesity among African American women and girls."
0,"In recent years there has been a growing call to historicize sociology by paying more attention to the contextual importance of time and place as well as to issues of process and contingency. Meeting this goal requires bringing historical sociology and interactionism into greater conversation via a historical theory of social situations. Toward this end, the authors of this article draw on Erving Goffman's work in Frame Analysis to conceptualize experience in social situations as grounded in multilayered cognitive frames and to demonstrate how such a framework helps illuminate historical changes in situated interaction."
0,"Current estimates suggest that one of every 100 American adults is now incarcerated, and each year more than 650,000 individuals are released from prison.  Scholars studying this growing ex-inmate population have, to this point, focused on how incarceration impacts individual outcomes such as employment, earnings or health.  Missing from this literature is an examination of how incarceration potentially impacts the communities to which ex-inmates return following their release from prison.  Using nationally representative panel data, this study begins to fill this empirical gap by examining how incarceration impacts the racial composition of ex-inmates neighborhoods.  Using fixed-effects model specifications – which examine within person change over time – we find that incarceration channels ex-inmates into certain types of neighborhoods.  However, we further find that this effect is not uniform across different racial and ethnic groups or over time."

However, while extensive research has identified individual level predictors of this phenomenon, few studies have theorized and tested the effect of structural social forces on children’s and youths’ alcohol consumption. In an attempt to address this gap, we study the simultaneous effects of personality, familial, and residential environments on children’s and youths’ underage drinking. Integrating informal social control and opportunity explanations of deviance, we first suggest that while informal social controls (i.e. parental supervision and neighborhood collective efficacy) prevent adolescents’ underage drinking, individuals’ access to local alcohol retail shops encourages such behavior. Focusing on the interactive effects of communal opportunities and controls, we then suggest that neighborhood collective efficacy reduces the probability of alcohol retail shops to lead to underage drinking. We test our theoretical model using the unprecedented data design available in the PHDCN. Results from a series of multilevel logit models with robust standard errors reveal support for our hypotheses; specifically, we find that family supervision prevents child and youth alcohol consumption, and that alcohol sales in a given neighborhood increases adolescents’ alcohol use. In addition, while the direct effect of collective efficacy is insignificantly related to children’s and youths’ alcohol consumption, our models suggest that it significantly reduces the probability of local alcohol retailers to result in underage drinking."
0,"Computational simulations of early human societies based on modified Lotka-Volterra predator/prey models are presented and discussed.  The ""nasty bottom,"" or the demographic regulator which keeps both animal and many early human societies small and geographically localized is introduced and discussed in its implications for world systems theorizing.  Two vicious cycles of the demographic regulator are tackled: 1) the relationship between humans and their environmental resources, and 2) the conflict and migration cycles that regulate small societies prior to hierarchy formation and technological advancement.  The models provide insight into why early human populations remained relatively small in number, and have implications for understanding how humans eventually broke free from this demographic regulator and gained control over most of the terrestrial earth."
0,"Previous studies on social integration of immigrants were predominantly of static nature. This article provides a dynamic account by distinguishing differences in social integration that develop shortly after immigrants' arrival in the host country from changes with length of stay. We examine contacts in leisure time between natives and non-western immigrants in the Netherlands. Theories from research on ethnic intermarriage are applied to these more common forms of contact. We use pooled cross-sectional survey data from 1988-2002. The results show that on average social integration increases with length of stay. Ethnicity, migration motive and home country education account for differences in integration that develop shortly after arrival and are maintained or even increased with length of stay, while the size of the immigrant group matters mainly at entry and then loses its influence over time. Age at migration exclusively explains differences in social integration that develop with length of stay. "
0,"Much scholarly writing has argued that although racial and ethnic minorities have experienced increasing rates of suburbanization over the past several decades, much of this suburbanization has been confined to inner-ring suburbs that function more or less as extensions of central city ghettoes. However, there has been surprisingly little empirical investigation of this question. Most prior research treats “suburbs” as all tracts in a metropolitan area that are not in the central city, and does not account for the spatial location of those suburban places. In this study we used Geographic Information Systems software to code the “ecological distance” (or suburban “ring”) of all Census Designated Places in some 250 metropolitan areas. We then use census data and multi-level modeling techniques to investigate patterns of white and minority suburbanization from 1970 to 2000. We test two hypotheses regarding the causes of variation in the location of suburban minorities. First, variation could be related to changes in the socioeconomic characteristics of group members; that is, as minority groups experience increases in socioeconomic status, they may on average convert such increases into residence in more distant suburban rings over time. Second, variation could be related to the extent to which outlying suburban rings have developed, thereby pulling non-Hispanic whites further out and creating housing vacancies in closer-in suburban rings. The results from this study should provide a detailed picture of the extent to which suburbs—and more importantly, which suburbs—have become more heterogeneous over time."
0,"Although it often goes unnoticed, framing is an activity that many people engage in on a regular basis, especially as a strategy to convince other people to do something or to feel a certain way about something. In this paper, I draw on a variety of archival data to examine the framing strategies of two groups  the mass media and a group of skating fans called SkateFAIR  in regard to the judging scandal in figure skating during the 2002 Olympic pairs event, and the judging changes that followed. I find that although the media and skating fans have adopted many similar concepts in framing these judging changes, their uses of these frames have often been vastly different. In particular, although the media has discussed certain aspects and consequences of the judging changes in a negative light, reporters' framing of the judging changes has generally been much more positive than that of skating fans. In addition to extending previous work on framing and social movements, this study addresses several fundamental social processes that are relevant to many areas beyond sport, including contentious politics, public opinion formation, and the construction and representation of interests."
0,"This study examines how patterns of racial and ethnic segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas vary by household structure. Specifically, using tract-level summary files from the 2000 decennial census, we estimated levels of metropolitan segregation for different racial and ethnic groups by household composition and poverty status. We find that when using the dissimilarity index, white households with children, and especially poor ones, are more segregated from black, Hispanic, and Asian households than are white households as a whole. Results from the interaction index provide complimentary information. In large part because nonpoor white married-couple households are more numerous than other groups in most metropolitan areas, Such households tend to have relatively less interaction with other racial and ethnic groups, and black and Hispanic households in particular. In contrast, minority group members often live in neighborhoods with a high proportion of non-Hispanic white households. Among all three minority group families with children, nonpoor married householders had the highest levels of interaction with whites. These results show that household structure shapes racial and ethnic residential patterns in U.S. metropolitan areas. "
0,"It has often been proposed that new cleavages have emerged within the middle class. In this paper, we examine the distinction between social and cultural specialists and technocrats, and investigate whether these new and old middle class fractions are differentiated by their patterns of intergenerational mobility. To what extent do these newly distinguished middle class fractions have specific external and internal intergenerational mobility patterns? And to what extent have mobility boundaries between them been rising over time? To answer these questions, we use 47 Dutch national population sample surveys with detailed occupation codes collected between 1970 and 2006 (N = 60,978). Our analyses of internal and external homogeneity show that the middle class fractions each have characteristic mobility and immobility patterns and therefore a necessary condition is satisfied to declare them as separate classes. Furthermore, in the early periods, the social and cultural specialists were differentiated by a high level of immobility but in the later periods, the distance between the old and new middle classes has decreased significantly.

0,"Whites, blacks and Latinos in the United States tend to live in different neighborhoods and attend different schools. Does this segregation influence youth in the long run? This study used longitudinal data from the NELS to see whether neighborhoods' or schools' proportion black and/or Latino during the high school years influences educational attainment through age 26. The analyses indicate that concentrations of blacks and Latinos in schools, but not zip code areas, associates with lower attainment in the long run. Students in predominantly black and Latino schools are less likely to earn a high school diploma or equivalent and to earn a bachelor's degree or more than similar students in predominantly white schools."
0,"This paper examines the social construction of the obese body in Canadian law.   I look at key tribunal and human rights decisions to argue that there are competing constructions.    Obesity is seen as a weakness, sickness, and social pariah.   These constructions contradict one another and consequently, leave the obese body as  contentious.     This leaves obese persons in a difficult social location, one that they may try to deny, or eliminate, rather than claim as an identity.   Because of this it is unlikely that an obesity politic will emerge.    Judicial activism and scholarly analysis may therefore be the only route to address this form of discrimination."
0,"Gang activity and membership were noted to be significantly related to financial rewards. As such, gang membership and gang activity should also be understood from an economic perspective. In this article, Pierre Bourdieu's framework of capital is used to analyze two separate samples of Latino and Asian gang members. Stark contrasts in socioeconomic backgrounds are recorded among the two samples of gang members, and gang membership and activities are also noticeably dissimilar. Accessibility to economic, cultural, and social capital is argued to affect gang membership and activities. The results suggest that the availability of legitimate and illegitimate capital greatly affects the trajectory and the length of gang involvement. Also, gangs provide significant material and social capital for the respondents of the study."
0,"A recent debate in sociological exchange theory concerns which form of exchange is likely to promote cohesion in exchange relations. One side maintains that bilateral exchange, often associated with economic transactions, entails joint action to share mutual benefits, contributing more to feelings of cohesion than do independent acts of unilateral giving from one person to another, typical of social exchange. The other side argues that bilateral exchange requires dividing resources under binding terms of exchange, which strains relationships by underscoring competitive aspects of exchange. The present study reconciles these divergent claims by testing a new model of exchange that combines key propositions from past theories to specify when bilateral exchange promotes or undermines cohesion. Results from two laboratory experiments provide support for the model's core claim that cooperative forms of bilateral exchange can reinforce cohesion more than unilateral exchange does, contrary to the enduring assumption that economic exchange undermines relational bonds."
0,"This study adds to the existing research concerning ecological relationships between suicide rates, social interaction, and urbanicity in the United States. Age-sex-race adjusted five-year averaged suicide rates for 1993-1997 and various measures of urbanicity are used. Some proposed relationships held true, while others indicate that social integration and urbanicity are so intertwined in their effects on suicide that no clear, unidirectional pattern emerges. The religious affiliation measure captured unique variations in the role religion plays in this relationship, depending on how urbanicity was measured. Findings suggest closer attention needs to be paid to how both urbanicity and religious affiliation are measured. Overall, vast regional variation exists in suicide rates and the role of urbanization can be misunderstood if not properly specified."

0,"As women pursue careers while retaining primary responsibility for family life, discretionary time is an emerging arena of gender inequality in contemporary life. This study examines gender inequality in waking role obligations and the implications for differences in sleep disruption. Drawing on a sample of 583 retail food workers, who regularly worked nights and rotating schedules, we find in our multivariate modeling that women experience significantly more sleep disruption than do men. A decomposition analysis shows that almost one-half of the gender gap in sleep disruption is accounted for by gender differences in health status and various dimensions of work-family context. By implication, the remainder of the gender gap in sleep disruption is attributable to differences in responsibility for work-family obligations. Given the need for more research on how work-family conflict affects health and well-being, further research on sleep patterns is warranted."
0,"This paper assesses the battle over school desegregation in Prince Edward County, Virginia, the only locality to close its schools for an extended period (five years) rather than desegregate them.  A 1951 strike at Moton High School by local students against the inferior condition of black schools led to Prince Edward becoming one of the five cases decided in Brown v. Board of Education (1954).  When the county faced a final desegregation order in 1959, it closed public schools, reopening them only under a 1964 Supreme Court edict.  Much of the battle over school desegregation in PEC took place in courtrooms.  After the 1959 school closings, a sustained campaign of direct action did not take place until Summer 1963.  This paper assesses whether an earlier and more sustained emphasis on direct action might have pressured Prince Edward County authorities to reopen public schools before 1964.  After analyzing the obstacles to launching a direct-action campaign in the county, I evaluate the likelihood that such a strategy would have produced tangible results.  While the drama of sit-ins, demonstrations and boycotts has drawn the preponderance of media and scholarly attention, understandings of the civil rights movement are incomplete without more sustained analysis of how legal mobilization strategies--the pursuit of movement goals through litigation--interacted with these outsider tactics."
0,"Sociological theory and public discourse raise concerns about division, fragmentation, or attenuation in our collective life rooted in, among other things, racial or religious differences, but we know very little about how ordinary Americans imagine themselves as similar to and different from their fellow citizens. In a recent, nationally representative telephone survey (2003, N = 2081) we asked over 2,000 Americans whether the members of ten different racial/ethnic, religious, or social groups ""share your vision of America."" We used cluster analysis and found three patterns of responses to this set of questions, patterns that reflect differences in social location and correspond to different views of diversity, group stereotypes, and understandings of American society. We argue that what we find reveals different dimensions along which Americans draw symbolic boundaries in public life, and that how these boundaries are drawn is rooted in three different visions of America. Optimistic pluralists believe in the positive value of diversity and are unwilling to exclude people on the basis of religion, ethnicity, or lifestyle; critics of multiculturalism are critical of diversity and are wary about contemporary social changes and political and social ""out-groups;"" and cultural preservationists imagine an America with a moral order underpinned by shared values and a history of a unified white, Christian culture. In the conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for scholarship on multiculturalism and the ""culture wars,"" and we call for more research on how ordinary Americans interpret the meanings and implications of social differences in public life."
0,"The resource compensation hypothesis predicts that religiosity will serve as a cognitive buffer against structural constraints whereby more religious individuals will exhibit lower levels of fatalism than their less religious counterparts. The resource amplification perspective, on the other hand, predicts that religiosity will foster a sense that otherworldly forces control life's outcomes, leading to higher levels of fatalism. Using a precise measure of fatalism from the two most recent waves of the World Values Survey, a comparative examination of three Latin American countries, South Africa, and the United States is carried out. With Mexico as the sole exception, findings from ordered logistic regression models suggest that higher levels of religiosity are associated with lower levels of fatalism, supporting the resource compensation hypothesis. Implications for longstanding debates over the salience of modern religion are considered. An important and underappreciated cognitive function provided by thriving religious denominations and institutions may be to provide a catalyst for personal empowerment that comes through the rejection of a fatalistic mentality."

0,"Researchers have established that individual religiosity influences abortion attitudes, and that abortion attitudes, in turn, shape abortion restrictions and access. Less clear is whether religion and abortion structural constraints influence abortion decisions. This study examines the several individual, contextual, and structural factors that could shape the abortion decisions of women who conceive before marriage. Special attention is given to the importance of academic aspirations and structural constraints, in contrast to religious beliefs and county religious context, for making an abortion decision. Hierarchical modeling techniques and two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) are employed. Neither generic religiosity nor conservative Protestant religious context appear to influence women's abortion decisions. Conversely, young women's abortion decisions are shaped by academic ambition, identification with a conservative Protestant denomination, proximity to an abortion clinic and the level of public abortion funding in their county of residence.

0,"Imagined futures, once a vital topic of theoretical inquiry within the sociology of culture, have been sidelined in recent decades. Rational choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling, the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort, unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a virtuous identity, claims to be ""one who aspires."""
0,"U.S. immigration policies after 1965 fueled a rise in the Latino population and, thus, increased the competition for low-skill jobs. We examine whether Latino immigration and Latino dominance of low-skill industries increases black urban violence. Using city-level data for the year 2000, we find that (1. Latino immigration is positively linked to urban black violence, (2. the link is most prevalent where blacks lost ground to Latinos in low-skill markets, (3. not all low-skill sectors operate in unison; black violence rises only when jobs in agriculture, manufacturing and construction are in short supply and, (4. Latino immigration raises black violence by first increasing black unemployment. We discuss the implications of these findings."
0,"Much research examines the organizational changes brought by equal employment opportunity (EEO) law, but it remains unclear whether establishments formally charged with employment discrimination and found in violation of EEO laws actually improve workplace conditions for women and racial minorities. Building on economic and institutional accounts of organizational responses to legal intervention, this article assesses the effects of discrimination charges and their resolutions on changes in establishment-level occupational segregation by sex and race from 1990 to 2002. Using data from a national random sample of work establishments matched to discrimination charge data, I examine the direct impact of charges on workplaces, as well as the indirect pressures that establishments experience in their legal and organizational environments. For sex segregation, I find that establishments do not desegregate in the wake of discrimination charges filed directly against them, but they do respond to EEO enforcement in their industrial fields and legal environments. For race segregation, organizational factors-rather than legal intervention-are the primary predictors of desegregation. To the extent that EEO enforcement encourages organizational change, it does so indirectly operating through establishments' industrial and legal environments."
0,"Most sociological research on social bond formation has argued that status-attraction and self-selection (homophily) narrow the pool of suitable persons, and then within the remaining set, a process of social interaction discerns who will associate with whom. This paper attempts to provide empirical evidence of how synchronization and emotional intensification play a role in bond formation after initial screening. We identify how emotional features of speech, such as intonation and prosody, are used to encourage a reciprocal social bond. And how all too often, the desired effect of finding a match, is accomplished by prosodic alignment and positive emotional expression. Last, we find prosodic features of speech are most influential in initial moments of an encounter (blink decisions), and quickly establish who is willing to associate with whom. To establish these findings we collected original data on speed dating events using surveys and audio recordings. With this information we identify a variety of audio features emblematic of prosody and intonation, and through multi-level modeling, discern which prosodic styles are more or less associated with desired forms of tie formation (i.e., date selection)."
0,"Much has been studied about how adults in the U.S. travel, but relatively less has been said about the travel patterns of children. In fact, the first time nationally representative data about the daily travel patterns of children under the age of five was collected, was in the 2001 National Household Travel Survey sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Understanding childrens travel in our society has multifaceted importance. For example, children under five who are driven around by adults do not have the same risk factors as teens who are new drivers.  There are health consequences associated with the travel patterns of children as well. Researchers have been concerned about the dwindling numbers of children walking to school, even when the distance between home and school has not changed. Even though this can be purely viewed as a health or transportation issue, there are social implications to how children use their time. Results from this study indicate that not only are there differences in travel behaviors between adults and children, but there are also differences across age groups as well as subgroups. This paper provides a starting point to better understand why and how children in the U.S. travel."
0,"I use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study to investigate the prevalence, perceived effectiveness, and correlates of end-of-life discussions among married men and women in their mid 60s. I address three research questions: How well understood do people feel after discussing their end-of-life medical care preferences with their spouses? Is a persons perception of high marital quality associated with feeling understood after an end-of-life discussion? Do spouses perceptions of marital quality contribute to their partners perceptions that they have been understood? Nearly 80% of primary respondents reported that their spouses understood their preferences extremely well. Primary respondents perceptions of high marital quality were associated with the perception of having been extremely well understood. Spouses perceptions of high marital quality also have independent main effects on primary respondents perceptions of having been extremely well understood, but there was not a significant interaction between the marital quality perceptions of primary respondents and spouses. I discuss implications for health care providers who are interested in facilitating effective spousal communication about end-of-life decision-making."
0,"Analysis of official commemorations held in Berlin for the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall shows a significant shift in both time perspective and genre when compared with the history of German commemoration. Specifically, there has been a departure from atonement for a deeper shameful and traumatic past to “mnemonic consolidation” of a very recent heroic, agentic, and hopeful past. This change in commemorative strategy serves Germany’s federal government’s needs for international political legitimation as a morally responsible nation in the present as well as its aspirations for political leadership in the European Union and globally in the future. Consolidating the memory of former East German’s roles as resisters of  dictatorship into the longer term official commemorative memory provides public, positive, and agentic templates of action for future German selves as well as differentiation from its shameful past as perpetrators."
0,"Multinational Corporations (MNCs), especially those with headquarters in the U.S., have been usually singled out as the flagship of the globalization process. However, empirical research on the internationalization trends of these firms displays mixed findings and conclusions regarding the validity of the globalization statement and the presumed ubiquity on the foreign operation of the major U.S.-based MNCs. In effect, based on some evidence in the worldwide pattern of the sales of the largest 500 MNCs, some have argued that the whole concept of globalization has only marginal value. Others have contested the regionalization findings and suggest need to look beyond economic variables. This paper joins this debate, by analyzing the evolution of the internationalization pattern of the largest U.S.-based MNCs over a relatively long period, between 1980 and 2001. In addition, we went a step further and try to explain why U.S. firms operate in some countries or change destinations over time by looking at the characteristics of those countries."
0,"In this paper we focus on the importance of organizational relations and networking outcomes as vital subjects in understanding the multi-level nature of transnational environmental organizing and activism. The analysis looks at how organizations within the global climate justice movement seek to influence the current negotiations occurring within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP). Specifically, how subordinate groups such as indigenous peoples (subsistence farmers, fisher and forest folk) from developing countries working with other organizations in a transnational movement network, Climate Justice Now!, articulate tensions and conflicts related to a global environmental treaty with potentially far-reaching effects on their local economies, land rights, and human rights. We utilize an organizational ethnography to analyze three interconnected components related to the GCJM and the UNFCCC negotiations:  transnational network emergence and participation; organizational framing strategies and targets; and management of inclusivity within these networks. This examination draws specifically on Feldman and Quick’s (2009) work conceptualizing organizational framing as a process dependent on what they term framing cascades which link events to framing processes and resource use. We isolate three such cascades in our analysis of the Climate Justice Now! network: emergence cascade, inclusion cascade, and strategic cascade. The framing processes in each cascade are both related to the patterns of transnational resourcing strategies and the outcomes of events within that cascade as well as the dynamics of prior cascades."
0,"This study explores the benefits of high school assisted job placement by gender. Based on previous findings that suggest women's networks are less helpful for finding a job than men's networks, particular emphasis is placed on the comparison between high school assistance and the use of personal contacts to secure a job.   The findings suggest that various job search methods are differentially beneficial by gender, with the use of personal contacts resulting in higher occupational outcomes for men and high school placement resulting in higher occupational outcomes for women.  The benefits women accrue from using school assisted job placement are partially due to the placement of women into occupations which are higher paid and more stable vis-à-vis other female-dominated occupations."
0,"There has been a great deal of recent research on the social consequences of incarceration, but empirical work documenting whether and when incarceration matters has developed faster than theoretical frameworks for understanding why and how it matters.  The prevailing frameworks are generally either incomplete or focus on conventional mechanisms of stratification, which are useful for some applications, but appear insufficient for explaining certain features of incarceration.  Although some prior research points to the importance of stigma—which pushes research toward a more nuanced appreciation of discrimination—the stigma concept is broader within social psychology than how it is employed with respect to incarceration.  In this essay, we outline what a robust sociological consideration of social psychology has to contribute to the debate, focusing in particular on the social psychology of stigma, prisonization, and the self-concept, as well as person-environment interactions that join the characteristics of former inmates with the environments they encounter upon release.  A social psychological perspective is particularly valuable because it helps to unite disparate research agendas under a common conceptual rubric.  Moreover such a perspective introduces a more dialectic and transactive approach between those who focus on the social structure of former inmate disadvantage, including employer discrimination, and those who focus on the personal characteristics of former inmates."
0,"Investigating immigrant residential patterns in 1880 offers a baseline for understanding residential assimilation trajectories in subsequent eras. This study uses 100% count information from the 1880 Census to estimate a multilevel model of ethnic isolation and exposure to native whites in 67 cities for individual Irish, German and British residents. At the individual level, the key predictors are drawn from assimilation theory: nativity, occupation, and marital status. The multilevel model makes it possible to control for these predictors and to study independent sources of variation in segregation across cities. There is considerable variation at the city level, especially due to differences in the relative sizes of groups. Other significant city-level predictors of people's neighborhood composition include the share of group members who are foreign-born, the disparity in occupational standing between group members and native whites, and the degree of occupational segregation between them.

We know a fair amount about the salutary effects of womens friendships, but what role does the one person play who is the most trusted member of ones inner circle?  Older women are intensively interviewed about their friendship- and health-histories.  Using a grounded theory methodology, their words lead to concepts that provide new avenues of exploration for scholars.  Specifically, they speak in rich and varied terms about the effects of friendship on their health, including the effects of a singular friend, daughter, mother, sister, or partner.  Several women have difficulty identifying one individual as a confidante and two consider themselves the individuals to whom they are the closest.  These individuals contribute to all aspects of their healthphysical, mental, social, spiritual."
0,"Policies increasingly consider the rights of same-sex couples, but scientific knowledge about these couples are limited.  We use new information from lesbians, gays and heterosexuals residing in California to estimate the percent in cohabiting and serious dating relationships.  We also investigate the characteristics associated with forming a union among lesbians, gays, and heterosexuals. Using data from the 2004-05 California Quality of Life Survey, a probability sample of California adults, we find that lesbians and gay men are less likely than heterosexuals to be in a relationship.  Forty-seven percent of self-identified lesbians and 33% of self-identified gay men live are cohabiting and 15% of lesbians and gay men report a serious dating partner.  Results show that education and earnings are not significant predictors of being in a co-residential relationship for lesbians and gay men, in contrast to heterosexuals.  However, employment status, race, and geography were similar predictors of relationship status across sexual orientation groups.  Our findings shed light on the process of union formation among lesbians and gay men."

0,"Why did some social movement organization (SMO)families receive extensive media coverage? In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization, political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and 34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard form of ""political opportunity,"" is not part of the solution. Our results support the main perspectives, while also suggesting that movement scholars may need to reexamine their ideas of favorable political contexts."
0,"This study examines how young immigrants are faring in new destinations using individual level data front the 2000 IPUMS to assess the relative roles of race/ethnicity, nativity, country of origin, and place on the likelihood of not being enrolled in high school for youth aged 15-17. I found that place plays a nuanced role in the risk of non-enrollment that varies by nativity as well as other household characteristics. While children in general have higher risks of dropping out in new destination communities relative to those in established immigrant communities, the risks to immigrant children are even greater. I found that Mexican and Guatemalan origin immigrants are particularly vulnerable, especially in places with the largest increases in the percent foreign born. The implications of these findings for both immigrants and their communities are discussed in the conclusion. "
0,"Considering long-distance advocacy as a distinctive institution of European modernity, the article examines the genesis and history of networks engaged in political action on behalf of distant others. Ever since the beginnings of European expansion overseas in the sixteenth century, such networks have originated from a persistent pattern of radicalization of religious actors against rival networks within the context of empire. In the late eighteenth century, the very same processes led to the establishment of modern forms of long-distance advocacy, with the international movement against colonial slavery and the slave trade. Throughout, long-distance advocacy was initiated and carried out by distinctively reformist and activist religious organizations within Catholicism and Protestantism. These findings highlight the importance of religious organizations in the imperial context for the configuration of modern forms of political activism."
0,"This study addresses processes involved in gender segregation of household labor in the United States.  Specifically, the analyzes focus on the potential of an explicit measure of marital power, defined as the person with the final say in key household decisions, to explain the gendered division of household labor. The current research utilizes a representative sample of male and female married American respondents who live with their partner (N = 532) from the 2002 International Social Survey Programme: Family and Changing Gender Roles (ISSP 2002).  The findings reveal that gender moderates the relationship between power and division of household labor.  This suggests that regardless of the power structure in intimate relationships women still perform the majority of housework necessary to maintain the family.  Measuring the relationships between relative resources, marital power, and the division of household labor represents an important step towards a more nuanced understanding of the segregated nature of housework."
0,"This paper examines the “stop snitching” phenomenon in relation to teenagers and schooling.  It shows evidence of a code against sharing information with formal authorities among students at two low income schools: a predominately black, urban school and a predominately white, rural school.  Using Bourdieu’s concept of habitus, the analysis demonstrates how anti-snitching is woven into the social fabric of these communities, prompting student ambivalence toward school-sanctioned methods of conflict resolution.  The findings highlight the broad reach of the anti-snitching phenomenon, situating this mentality as the result of community-based distrust of formal authority.  The paper assesses implications of anti-snitching for school discipline and climate."

This study for 1880-1910 includes information on the birthplace of men's grandparents, so we can compare the first, second, third, and later generations. We estimate the odds of marrying a native white woman with native-born parents (NWNP) for Irish, Germans, British, and men of other ethnicities. Most groups even in their third generation still show a significantly lower rate of marital assimilation than native stock men. But mixed ancestry (having at least one NWNP parent or grandparent) can result in nearly complete marital assimilation by the third generation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Our original article espoused a simple way to recode religious groups on the General Social Survey (GSS) into historically meaningful categories and attempted to steer social scientists away from assigning these groups to a ""Liberal-Moderate-Conservative"" scale (Smith 1990). Among other problems, such scales create arbitrary cutpoints, have little to do with the historical movements that gave rise to particular religious affiliations and tend to conflate religious, economic, social and political ideas into one monolithic measure. In contrast, we assigned Protestants to mainline, evangelical and Black Protestant categories. In 12 short years, our classificatory system (RELTRAD) has become the standard way to code GSS affiliation data and has been utilized in many other survey efforts. Since its publication, no competing classificatory schemes have emerged to replace it. This article extends our earlier work and raises a series of theoretical and methodological issues for consideration by scholars in efforts to classify religious groups for analysis purposes."
0,"Studies of beliefs about social stratification have generally focused on how individual-level factors shape people's explanations of poverty and inequality. In this article, the authors contribute to this literature by adding a community-level measure of ""concentrated disadvantage"" (poverty and associated conditions) to models predicting support for individualistic (person-centered) and structuralist (system-challenging) beliefs about the causes of poverty. Using data from two Los Angeles County surveys and the 1990 Census, multi-level linear and logistic regression models reveal that higher levels of concentrated disadvantage are associated with increased support for both individualist and structuralist explanations of poverty-a ""dual consciousness"" pattern the authors attribute to increased exposure to social conditions that simultaneously foster sympathetic and antagonistic attitudes toward the poor. These findings add useful information to our knowledge of stratification beliefs and contribute to a growing body of studies showing that ""place-level"" factors can be important determinants of beliefs and attitudes net of individual-level covariates."
0,"This article analyzes how Central American immigrants in tenuous legal statuses experience current immigration laws. Based on ethnographic observations and over 200 interviews conducted between 1998 and 2010 with immigrants in Los Angeles and Phoenix and individuals in sending communities, this study reveals how the convergence and implementation of immigration and criminal law constitute forms of violence. Drawing on theories of structural and symbolic violence, the authors use the analytic category ""legal violence"" to capture the normalized but cumulatively injurious effects of the law. The analysis focuses on three central and interrelated areas of immigrants' lives-work, family, and school-to expose how the criminalization of immigrants at the federal, state, and local levels is not only exclusionary but also generates violent effects for individual immigrants and their families, affecting everyday lives and long-term incorporation processes."
0,"Drawing on previous theoretical and empirical work, we posit that maternal employment influences on child well-being vary across birth cohorts. We investigate this possibility by analyzing longitudinal data from a sample of children and their mothers drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We introduce a series of age, cohort, and maternal employment interaction terms into multilevel models predicting child well-being to assess whether any potential short-term or long-term effects of early and current maternal employment vary across birth cohorts. Results indicate that maternal employment largely is inconsequential to child well-being regardless of birth cohort, with a few exceptions. For instance, children born in earlier cohorts may have experienced long-term positive effects of having an employed mother; however, as maternal employment became more commonplace in recent cohorts, these beneficial effects appear to have disappeared. We discuss theoretical and methodological implications of these findings. "
0,"Toxic or harmful working conditions are an important problem for workers and organizations. Fully understanding the consequences of such conditions has been difficult because in-depth information across organizational contexts is scarce. The current article makes use of a new data set based on content coding the full population of organizational ethnographies (N = 212) to secure in-depth evaluations across a wide range of organizational contexts. The analysis confirms the role of lack of autonomy and lack of skills as toxic working conditions but suggests an equally important role for organizational chaos. Importantly, returning to the narrative accounts allows exploration of the buffering and exacerbating roles of coworker relations and employee involvement and the mechanisms through which these work to moderate other conditions."
0,"This article looks at the effect of religious involvement on civic engagement. Most of the literature on this issue generally agrees that there tends to be a positive correlation between these two, however, some recent articles have found a negative association between religious service attendance and civic engagement. This article seeks to better understand the reason for this finding. By dividing the sample into three groups,  The Religiously Networked, The Religiously Uninvolved and The Disengaged Attenders, this analysis sheds light on the nature of religious involvement and, subsequently, the reason for the negative association between attendance and civic engagement. The findings essentially suggest that the Disengaged Attenders, a group who attend religious services frequently while avoiding active involvement in religious groups are the cause of the negative sign. This group, while not very large (8.2% of the population), is the least involved in civic engagement, and thus creates a problem for studies using attendance to measure religious involvement as an independent variable with civic engagement as the outcome variable."
0,"Parents are primarily understood as interested spectators, external stakeholders, or helpful partners of teachers, mostly interested in the educational outcomes of their individual child, rather than the organizational dynamics that shape the everyday instructional environments. Recent research by Annette Lareau and others suggests, however, that middle-class parents are able to “open” the closed classroom door (Lareau 1988; 2003; Horvat et al 2003; Lareau and Horvat 1999; Cucchiara, Maia and Erin Horvat 2009; Useem 1992; Lareau and Munoz, 2009). Findings from this research suggest that watching parents form a “shadow administration” that changes how work gets done in schools. I borrow the term “shadow” from well established work done by Baker and Stevenson, Bray and others (Marimuthu, Singh et al. 1991, Stevenson and Baker 1992, Bray 1999; 2003; 2008) and pair it with  “administration” to reflect the informal supervision that watching parents engage in while participating in surveillance networks. Two types of parents are identified: “shadow administrators” who are able to penetrate everyday organizational activities, and “subordinate partners”, who sought mentorship and social support from teachers. I examine how shadow administrators are involved in everyday school activities as they construct informal accountability pressures that allow them to carefully scrutinize teacher practices, using such resources as social connections, cultural familiarity and entitlement. I also identify the barriers that subordinate parents face when trying to gain access to timely, accurate information about organizational activities and uncover the ways in which parents encounter resistance when interacting with teachers and school administrators."
0,"Though Pierre Bourdieu has been criticized for ignoring the moral dimensions of social judgments, I suggest that his habitus concept can provide a useful theoretical foundation for a sociological analysis of morality. If the habitus is revised in a way that recognizes the embodied nature of cognition, it can be treated as a foundation for moral judgments of the self and of others. A revised habitus concept can account for two processes by which moral judgments are shaped by social settings: (1) cultural influences on feelings and expressions of emotion; and (2) the ways moral metaphors are structured by embodied cognitive schemas. In both processes, universal bodily operations are employed in different configurations across cultural settings. I argue that a modified habitus concept that can account for these phenomena has significant implications for the sociological analysis of lay morality."
0,"Most contemporary Thai Americans are women, who are overwhelmingly married to non-Thai men. This has continued to be the case even after the direct military link between the United States and Thailand ended, even though the Thai American population is much larger than in the past.  In this study, we look at exogamy among Thai Americans using U.S. Census data drawn from the IPUMS project. We ask: (1) What are the predictors of exogamy among Thai Americans? (2) How can we account for the high rates of exogamy among Thai American women, relative to Thai American men?  (3) How have the predictors of exogamy and the apparent characteristics of womens exogamy changed?  Our results are consistent with the argument that much of Thai American exogamy is historically rooted in the military connection between the United States and Thailand, and that the particularly high rate of exogamy among Thai American women is historically linked to this military connection. However, while Thai women have continued to show high rates of exogamy, there is evidence that this exogamy has been demilitarized."
0,"Many social movement researchers question the usefulness of political opportunity as a concept. However, others argue that it can be refined by disaggregating different opportunities for actors and outcomes to understand the underlying mechanisms that influence each. This research extends this analysis by asking ""Political opportunityfor whom?"" Looking at Canadian Aboriginal mobilization, it assesses how different opportunities influence a broad range of movement actors and organizations. Using data from a 50-year period it assesses how contemporaneous, lagged and change regression modeling of opportunities affect results. The article finds that structural opportunities around resources robustly influence a wide range of mobilization."
0,"This paper investigates the relationships among neighborhood characteristics, education-related parental practices, and children's academic achievement during a critical but under-studied stage of children's educational trajectories - the elementary school years. Using a large, nationally representative database of American elementary school students - the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) - and contextual data from the 2000 US Census, we examine parental practices and neighborhood characteristics at the beginning of children's school careers (grades K-1) and their associations with math achievement through the end of the 5th grade. Findings: Net of family-level characteristics, higher levels of early education-oriented parental practices were associated with higher mathematics achievement at the end of 5th grade, while neighborhood disadvantage was associated with lower 5th grade math achievement. Families residing in high poverty, high unemployment, low-education neighborhoods employed fewer education-oriented practices with their kindergarten-first grade children, but the positive effect of such parental practices on children's mathematics achievement was stronger for children who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

0,"Although law prohibits race-based exclusion in college sororities and fraternities in the United States, racial segregation prevails. As a result, nonwhite membership in white Greek-letter organizations (WGLOs) is often hailed as a transformative step toward equality and unity. The bulk of work on such cross-racial membership centers on comparative-historical and survey data and treats integrated membership as the successful end, rather than a problematic beginning, of analysis. Drawing upon in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in three university campuses on the East Coast, I shift the focus from resource factors that either prevent or enable membership to the strategies of action that nonwhite members employ in their everyday lives in order to be perceived as full, belonging members. By drawing upon the insights of the sociology of culture, I argue that robust racialized schemas simultaneously enable and constrain inclusion. Rather than hide explicit racial-ethnic difference or accede to traditional expectations of Anglo conformity, I find that nonwhite members are enmeshed in a paradox of participation: their ability to frame themselves as equal and belonging Greek ""brothers and sisters"" remains tied to a patterned reproduction of their racial and ethnic identities as essentially different and inferior. Such a paradox emerges as an important theoretical and pragmatic dilemma with implications for an array of institutional contexts. Keywords: whiteness, identity, schema, segregation, fraternity, sorority."
0,"Sending states such as Mexico and the Philippines increasingly view their emigrants as “national heroes” and the remittances they send back as part of the sending state’s economic development strategy. While Ukraine is economically comparable to these states, the Ukrainian state stigmatizes its emigrants to Italy as “prostitutes” and those to California as “defectors” making little effort to reach out to its citizens abroad. Why? I argue the answer lies in understanding Ukraine as a disarticulated nation-state and its nation-building process in a post-Soviet context. The Ukrainian state, in order to fulfill its First World aspirations of joining Europe and distancing itself from all things Soviet and Russian, produces these patterns of emigration which provide the basis of Ukraine’s new nation-building process while it simultaneously signals “Third World” rather than “First World” status in the international arena."
0,"Have the 2001 terrorist attacks and two wars continued to affect the partisan salience of national security issues in US elections? Was the impact of these issues in 2008 overshadowed by renewed focus on the part of voters to domestic conditions and policy issues? This study addresses these questions using recently-released data from the National Election Studies. Building from scholarship on the partisan politics of national security, we seek to incorporate two competing theoretical perspectives on these issues. We consider the 2008 contest in conjunction with the four elections that preceded it to take into account the impact of recent historical events and evaluate key hypotheses. The analysis offers new findings regarding the over-time pattern of influence of national security conflicts on voter choice. We find evidence for the importance of national security issues in the 2008 election, alongside established sources of voter preferences. Implications for theory and research are discussed in conclusion. "
0,"The educational, occupational and income success of the racial minority immigrant offspring is very similar for many immigrant origins groups in the United States, Canada and Australia. An analysis based on merged files of Current Population Surveys for the United States for the period 1995-2007, and the 2001 Censuses of Canada and Australia, and taking account of urban areas of immigrant settlement, reveals common patterns of high achievement for the Chinese and South Asian second generation, less for other Asian origins, and still less for those of Afro-Caribbean black origins. Relatively lower entry statuses for these immigrant groups in the US are eliminated for the second generation, indicating they experience stronger upward inter-generational mobility. As well, 'segmented assimilation' suggesting downward assimilation of Afro-Caribbean immigrants into an urban underclass in the US, also receives little support. "
0,"We use the life course perspective to argue that family transitions like divorce and remarriage are turning points in adolescents' lives and that emotional distress associated with these events are shaped by the circumstances surrounding them. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( Add Health), we explore how family transitions net of family structure are related to two types of emotional distress, acute depressive symptoms and excessive binge drinking, and whether family context moderates these associations. We find that going through a family transition is related to both outcomes, but only under certain circumstances. As maternal-adolescent emotional distance increases, the probability of severe emotional distress following a family transition increases. In addition, transitioning out of a single mother versus a mother-father household is related to a lower probability of reporting acute depressive symptoms."
0,"We report on an experiment that utilizes an application-files design to recreate several features of a hiring decision for junior-engineer positions. The critical situation under study involved an assessor (either male or female) and a male and a female candidate with highly similar professional qualifications but different self-presentation styles. We investigate effects from sex category of assessor, sex category and self-presentation of pair of candidates, and type of assessment decision (namely, choice between the two applicants, and ratings of their competence and suitability). Our hypotheses consider both gender as status and as social identity, and predict different outcomes depending on assessment decision. We found no evidence of bias against the female applicant. The question about competence elicited effects from self-presentation only, from both men and women; the choice of applicant and suitability measures show no bias against the female candidate by men and a bias in her favor by women.

0,"Social stratification is a difficult topic to teach to undergraduate students, especially given the popular American ethic of individualism. This paper describes an activity designed to simulate key aspects of social stratification, including the nature and impact of social structure. Discussion following the game often highlights not only the material and economic aspects of stratification, but also a variety of other related issues and can be used to sensitize students to the overall significance of social structure in understanding economic processes and outcomes."
0,"Much of the research on multiple role-identities has centered on the effects of role accumulation on psychological well-being, but there has been little work done on role accumulations effects on other outcomes.  Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this paper examines the possibility that the number of roles an actor assumes has an effect on how well he or she performs one of the roles in their constellation of role-identities.  Stripped of the confounding effects of socioeconomic background, peer group effects, gender, and previous academic performance, levels of academic achievementmeasured here by grades and test scoresbecome reasonable indicators of how well the actor performs the student role.  Findings suggest that there is a positive, and slightly nonlinear, relationship between total number of identities (role summation), changes in number of roles (role accumulation), and academic achievement.  I also explore the effects of student performance on future role accumulation."
0,"In this essay, we examine two forms of mediated contemporary Protestant evangelicalism in the United States: a Christian punk network, called Misfits United (MU), and a women’s group studying Beth Moore’s bible study, It’s Tough Being a Woman (ITBAW). These cases reveal that contemporary Protestant evangelicals deal with gender in diverse, contradictory, and complex ways. First, we show how both cases explicitly assume the presence of a masculine God, yet contradictorily present an image of God that is implicitly feminine. Second, we examine how different speech allowances for men and women produce a gendered language that reifies traditional gender roles and reinforces heterosexuality. Finally, we examine the emphasis placed on the body by both MU and ITBAW and argue that this emphasis is used to create a specifically sexualized male body and a distinctly asexual female body. We argue that the ways in which these cases understand a gendered God, use gendered language, and gender the body ultimately reinforce traditional gender roles, heterosexuality, and white and class-based privilege."
0,"The propensity score method has increasingly become a popular strategy for studying the treatment effects in sociology.  Developed in the context of policy/program evaluation, the methodological literature has typically assumed that whether an individual receives the treatment is endogenous but when an individual receives the treatment is exogenous.  This assumption, despite plausible when the treatment of interest is a policy/program, is unlikely to hold when the treatment is an event.  However, studying the effect of an event is a much more common research problem than studying the effect of a policy/program in sociological applications.  In this paper, I discuss methodological issues regarding the conventional logit approach to propensity score estimation when applied to studying the effect of an event.  Taking up on these issues, I propose a general hazard-model approach to propensity score estimation.  This approach is preferable to the conventional approach in that it not only accommodates a plausible dynamic behavioral model for the treatment assignment mechanism of an event, but allows the investigator to include time-varying covariates as well.  Empirical applications are illustrated by studying the average treatment effect of divorce on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979."
0,"Peer influence is a major if not overriding theme in much of the contemporary theory of adolescent deviance in general and substance use in particular.   There is little doubt that peer associations play an important role in the etiology of drug use in mid- and later adolescence.  But the corollary, that deviant adult influence plays no role, or only a very limited one, has not been systematically evaluated. This paper explores the role of adult influence controlling for the influence of peers.  I use data from the 1999 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse which includes information about more than 18,000 12 to 17-year-old boys and girls. The primary dependent variable in my analyses is whether the adolescent reported using at least one illicit substance in the past 12 months.  The extent of adult deviant modeling behavior was indicated by adolescent perception of adults use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. The extent of anticipated parental disapproval was measured by asking young people about their parents disapproval of the adolescent behavior. The results show that adolescent perceptions of adults use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana have a significant effect on their own drug use, net of perceived drug use and approval by peers. These findings from a major national sample highlight the need to reconsider adult influence on adolescent drug use."
0,"This essay seeks to specify some of the social-psychological determinants that led to the mobilization of deadly state crime in the Latin American authoritarian state context. The Mexican case provides an interesting case in which to specify some of these determinants because hundreds of leftist political party militants, often engaged in legal activities, have been gunned down by state agents (the police, the military, local politicians associated with the dominant party-state) or indirectly by hired guns on behalf of state leaders (Schatz 2001). I argue, in the Mexican case, that leadership authorization of destructive behavior was the critical activating historical condition activating deadly state crime because it created a permissive social milieu that allows for the utilization of more extreme forms of violence including the use of political assassination as a mode of social control. This permissive social milieu was, of course, aided by a passive legal system that generated the almost complete lack of penalties for state-sanctioned brutality. While none of these determinants alone may  be sufficient to produce a wave of political-electoral homicides, when they all combine, it makes such destructive behavior very likely to occur."
0,"Previous studies of urban inequality point to the flight of mainstream institutions and resources from urban cores, while recent research sharply challenges the pervasiveness of these accounts. These critiques illustrate how formal organizations in poor neighborhoods connect low-income populations to valuable resources through their interorganizational ties. This paper analyzes spatial, network, and qualitative data from 152 nonprofit youth enrichment organizations across 12 inner-city neighborhoods in Boston—the full population of organizations in that area—to investigate the relationship between interorganizational resource networks and neighborhood inequality. Findings reveal organizational resources are unevenly distributed across demographically similar neighborhoods, creating unequal, spatially disjointed pockets of resources in the inner-city. Nearly half of all interorganizational network ties cluster micro-locally, and as such, exacerbate rather than ameliorate intra-urban inequality. Qualitative data reveal the social process underlying the parochial network structure: Neighborhood violence restricts extra-local collaboration, while informal interactions between organizational leaders and indirect government incentives guide local clustering. Under these conditions, a parochial network of resource exchange emerges, magnifying between-neighborhood inequalities and explaining the disjuncture between theories of urban deinstitutionalization and recent critiques. Interorganizational networks therefore enhance individual-level organizational capacity in poor neighborhoods, but do little to offset neighborhood-level resource inequalities in the inner-city."
0,"Women patrons have played important roles in the construction of public concert halls in the second half of the twentieth century.  Through cultural work  voluntary labour promoting high culture   elite women were able to enter the public sphere and contribute to the cultural welfare and built environment of the city.  Two empirical examples from Los Angeles are explored in depth: Dorothy Chandler and the Pavilion at the Music Center that bears her name, as well as Lillian Disney and the Walt Disney Concert Hall.  The gendered geography of the bourgeois public sphere, the historical legacy of the concert hall, and the discourse of high art as public good provide the frameworks through which each building is considered.  These two examples, which are separated by four decades, reveal the evolution in the perceived role of the concert hall in society and the decreasing role of the arts patron in the construction of public monuments."
0,"What involvement do NGOs have in the decision-making and implementation of global agreements?  The roles that NGOs play in these more formal, bureaucratic processes which follow the more frequently studied agenda setting activities of NGOs, remain understudied. This paper shows that NGOs involvement in global politics occurs via their roles as 1) legitimizers, 2) experts, and 3) watchdogs.  The study shows how NGOs extensively engaged in the creation and implementation of the Kimberley Process (KP), a global regulatory body, which was created to curb the trade in conflict diamonds.  First, NGOs legitimacy and the moral deficits of the KP were critical in giving NGOs initial access to KP negotiations.  Second, NGO expertise was key in their ability to influence the KP in its day-to-day operations and in its key decision making bodies.  Third, NGOs served a dual monitoring function, from within the KP and as external watchdogs."
0,"Contemporary global resistance against extractive industry employs divergent collective action frames at different fields of resistances. Through a case of local-gone-global resistance, this paper illustrates two processes that are crucial in understanding the genesis and change of frames used by activists to rationalize collective action in Bangladesh. The first process includes a dialogic interaction between community versus state (government) and extractive industry through frames for negating an open-cast coal mine.  The second process, this paper elaborates is the evolution in collective identity of the community from being passive masses to be governed into active citizens empowered through the process of collective action. This process escalates by being exposed to information and state repression. Through elaborating these processes, this paper also proposes to replace the contemporary overemphasis on impact of the transnational sphere on global resistances and position local field at the centre stage."
0,"This article demonstrates that the Cultural Revolution led to a temporary decline in educational homogamy in urban China, which was reversed when the Cultural Revolution ended. Previous studies on educational homogamy in China have paid incomplete attention to China's shifting institutional structures. This research applies institutional theory to the trend of educational homogamy in urban China. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) state policies lowered educational legitimacy, educational homogeneity and mating opportunities in school in the urban marriage market while enhancing them before and after. From the institutional perspective I hypothesize that the strength of educational homogamy in urban China during the Cultural Revolution was weaker than before and after. I use log-multiplicative layer effect models to analyze data representative of urban residents in 20 cities. I find moderate but significant evidence for the institutional hypotheses. Educational assortative mating is subject to political intervention in urban China."
0,"The relationship between stigma and mental illness is arguably one of the longest standing themes of sociological inquiry. Most of the research on this relationship, both quantitative and qualitative, conflates the stigma of mental illness and the stigma of using psychiatric medication. The medicalization of mental illness has created a paradox with regard to antidepressant use. On the one hand viewing emotional illness as a results of faculty brain chemistry means that it is not a matter of personal weakness and legitimizes it as a disease. With treatment, people are able to perform their normal daily function and, therefore, less stigmatized. On the other hand, taking an antidepressant is seen as fundamentally not normal. Furthermore, it makes visible what was previously (theoretically) invisible, the depression. Following previous studies that have attempted to move away from macro-level discussions of medicalization, this paper examines the rhetorical strategies antidepressant consumers use to justify their illness and medication use both to others and to themselves. I find that discourses of heredity and analogies to more clearly ‘physical’ conditions are widely used, showing how antidepressant consumers internalize the medicalization of depression."
0,"Southeast Asia presents an unique opportunity to examine the often times, tumultuous post-colonial experiences of nation building, and explore the intersections of economic development, political culture and ideology. This historical-comparative study provides an account of the transformation of national identity and the redefinition of ethnicity in contemporary Indonesia and Malaysia. Using historical narratives and archival materials, I explain how and why discourses and practices that were particularly hostile and exclusionary towards the ethnic Chinese were replaced by more somewhat accommodating and inclusionary ones, and examine specific structural conditions that led to a reconfiguration of religious attitudes and practices, specifically Islam. Unlike studies that are inclined to characterize nation-building projects as part of state formation and expansion processes, I propose that these redefinitions are prompted by a reflexive and interactive relationship between state elites, ethnic entrepreneurs, class-based social groups, and civic organizations involving a negotiation of legitimacy. Despite the claims of autonomy and independence of the state from society by statist perspectives, this study shows that that which initially may appear to be deliberate and decisive action by state leadership and political elites can actually be unintentional, and can limit the states ability to maintain its claims of legitimacy among the citizens. Consequently, analyses of the role of the state and the corresponding political outcomes must take into more serious consideration the idea that political action is very much embedded in spatial and historical contexts."
0,"In examining the world-historical context of the rise of pan-Islamic nationalism in Iran, this paper posits Islamic fundamentalism as a modern and global (rather than premodern and local) movement.  Drawing on Polanyi and linking economy, polity, and culture, this study traces the origins of pan-Islamic nationalism in Iran to the transformation of the world-market relations in the second half of the nineteenth century and the rise of the food/agrarian regime after 1870.  It shows that the relations of the state and the mercantile classes with the world market led to conflicting developments, viz., the national contraction of the state on the one hand and the international expansion of  commercial classes on the other hand.  The latter, in the course of their struggles for state representation, merged with the rising pan-Islamic reaction against European expansion in the Islamic world. Pan-Islamism, by its capacity for articulating the economic nationalism of the mercantile classes in ethical terms, mobilized the masses of people for the struggle for the nationalization of the state. Hence, as a historical form, modernity and nationalism in the late nineteenth century Iran took a nonsecular character. Later, the Cold War politics revivified the pan-Islamic component of Iranian nationalism, creating the context for the rise to power of fundamentalism in the 1980s.  The paper warns against the reification of place"
0,"According to the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in poorer countries, 4% – 90% of women of reproductive age report that wife hitting or beating is justified. Yet, the sensitivity of women‘s responses to the wording of this attitudinal question is unknown. Using data from 496 female participants in a survey experiment in rural Bangladesh, we explored response effects to versions of the attitudinal question in the 2007 Bangladesh DHS that (1) followed its original wording, (2) portrayed the wife as not at fault in the five situations to which the question was applied, and (3) portrayed the wife as at fault in these five situations. The situations portraying the wife as not at fault resulted in low probabilities of justifying wife hitting or beating (0.01–0.09). Portraying the wife as at fault resulted in higher, more variable probabilities of this response (0.41–0.70), which resembled the probabilities when the original situations were used (0.38–0.57). Thus, attitudinal questions in the DHS may overestimate women‘s justification of wife hitting or beating, and better data on women‘s adherence (or not) to prevailing norms of wife blaming for violence may inform interventions to promote ideational change where violence against wives is prevalent."
0,"Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study and the Current Population Survey, we find that labor market conditions play a large role in explaining the positive relationship between educational attainment and marriage. Our results suggest that if low-educated parents enjoyed the same, stronger labor market conditions as their more-educated counterparts, then differences in marriage by education would narrow considerably. Better labor markets are positively related to marriage for fathers at all educational levels. In contrast, better labor markets are positively related to marriage for less-educated mothers but not their more-educated counterparts. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories about women's earning power and marriage, the current economic recession and future studies of differences in family structure across education groups."
0,"The federal court system has been used alternatively to maintain the status quo and to push for social change. Sociological literature identifies a cycle of racism such that civil rights progress is inevitably followed by backlash. Therein lay the ebbs and flows. This article puts the federal courts within this racial context. A review of desegregation and affirmative action case law from passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the present indicates that courts are not immune from these ebbs and flows but adhere to the cycle of progress and hostility to civil rights. Early gains in desegregation cases gave way to opposition to affirmative action. Then came Grutter, the recent Supreme Court decision supporting affirmative action. While this may signify another turning point back towards progress, individual factors may also explain why the Court was benevolent in this one instance while a general theme of hostility to civil rights continues."
0,"The United States leads the world in public higher education, with a substantial amount of funding coming from state, rather than federal, government sources. Perhaps not surprisingly, the amount states contribute varies widely, leading researchers to explore the sources of such variation. While numerous factors have been shown to matter, the potential relevance of political representation remains unclear. To address this gap, the relationship between state legislators own educational backgrounds and state spending on higher education is tested. Utilizing a database of publicly available information on the educational backgrounds of 6,517 state senators and representatives, we find that states with a higher percentage of legislators who attended state colleges and/or universities invest more generously in public higher education than other state legislatures. Results support theories of representation, suggesting that legislators may be directly advocating for spending given their own educational profiles."
0,"The degree to which children grow up in crowded housing is a neglected but potentially important aspect of social inequality. Poor living conditions can serve as a mechanism of social stratification, affecting children's wellbeing and resulting in the intergenerational transmission of social inequality. This paper reports an investigation of housing crowding on children's academic achievement, behavior, and health in the US and Los Angeles, a city with atypically high levels of crowding. We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Child Development Supplement and the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to explore the effect of living in a crowded home on an array of child wellbeing indicators. We find that several dimensions of children's wellbeing suffer when exposed to crowded living conditions, particularly in Los Angeles, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. The negative effects on children raised in crowded homes can persist throughout life, affecting their future socioeconomic status and adult wellbeing. "
0,"Though research is prolific on work-family conflict, there is little research demonstrating how employers impact time-use patterns and can effectively support working parents. This study uses data collected from a natural experiment in a corporate setting to investigate the relationships between a culture change initiative (Results Only Work Environment – ROWE), work-time control, time at work and with children, work-time behaviors like telecommuting and telecommuting variability, and work-family conflict among working parents. We examine the following questions: Does ROWE impact parent’s time spent at work and with children? Does ROWE increase working parents’ perceived control over their work time and/or change their behaviors regarding how they manage these responsibilities? Does ROWE, perceived work time control, and/or work-time behaviors reduce parents’ work-family conflict? Using longitudinal data from 215 working parents in a white-collar workplace, we examine the effect of workplace changes on time-use patterns as well as investigate which is more important, work-time behaviors like telecommuting or perceived control over work time. We find that ROWE does not influence time-use patterns but increases the likelihood of telecommuting and increases subjective perceptions of work-time control. Only perceived control over work time is significantly predictive of reduced work-family conflict for working parents."
0,"Anti-immigration attitudes and its origins have been investigated quite extensively. Research that focuses on the evolution of attitudes toward immigration, however, is far more scarce. In this paper, we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) to study the trend of anti-immigration attitudes between 2002 and 2007 in 17 European countries. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the critical legitimacy for comparing latent variable means over countries and time. A Multiple-Group Multiple Indicator Structural Equation Modeling (MGSEM) approach is used to test the cross-country and cross-time equivalence of the variables under study. In a second step, we try to offer an explanation for the observed trends using a dynamic version of group conflict theory. The country-specific evolutions in attitudes toward immigration are shown to coincide with national context factors, such as immigration flows and changes in unemployment rates. "
0,"Using ethnographic and interview data collected over twelve months at an anonymous public AIDS clinic in the Southeast United States, this paper illustrates how classification systems shape the routines of health care providers treating patients with the disease.  Due to financial constraints associated with the cost of prescription drugs, care providers were forced to balance their professional commitment to providing the standard of care in an increasingly complex area of medicine. The clinic established local routines in order to ensure a payer source for patients antiretroviral drug therapy before prescriptions were filled.  When the wait for enrolling in the government drug assistance program was long, providers were encouraged to use pharmaceutical company assistance programs so that patients could receive antiretroviral regimens quickly even if it was not considered optimum therapy by current treatment guidelines.  Additional local criteria were developed to be sure that patients designated as urgent starts could receive antiretrovirals immediately.  As funding for domestic AIDS treatment and prevention declines, public health practitioners will continue to face multiple layers of classification, including their own local layer, as part of the clinical routine.  This paper begins an examination of how these layers of classification shape the work of AIDS care."
0,"Cultural and urban sociologists commonly make assumptions regarding how individuals experience public worlds of cultural consumption in their everyday lives.  However, due to certain methodological constraints, collecting reliable empirical knowledge of such experiences can be somewhat difficult.  Drawing on ethnographic surveys collected among 135 female undergraduate students enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, I explore a number of ways in which young women consume urban nightlife as a distinctively gendered experience.  After providing a description of my method of data collection, I briefly discuss two aspects of this experience: (1) role-playing as a means of constructing a gendered nocturnal self, and (2) the routine public harassment of young women."
0,"Cohabitation is a complex family form that most Americans experience at some point in their lives (Smock 2000). Despite the diversity of cohabitation experiences, researchers focus on the temporary nature of cohabitation.  Studies show that couples who have cohabited for five or more years make up approximately ten percent of the cohabiting population (Bumpass and Sweet, 1989; Bumpass, Sweet, and Cherlin 1991, Brown and Booth 1996). Yet, scant theoretical and empirical attention has been given to this subset of cohabitors. Wave 1 of National Survey of Families and Households data are used to analyze to what extent long-term cohabiting couples are similar to and different from other cohabiting couples and married couples on sociodemographic and attitudinal variables as well as measures of relationship stability and quality."
0,"The characterological approach to culture in American interpretive sociology is contrasted with the structural approach common to many European sociologies, with the aim of bringing out the analytic weaknesses of the former. Goffmans Presentation of Self is placed in opposition to Simmels essay on the nature of historical understanding. Elements of the American approach to culture found in Goffman are traced back to William James, and forwards to current strands in American sociology, particularly those represented by Swidler and Collins, and are referenced to broader trends in American thought, in particular individualism and optimistic pragmatism. For American sociologists, it is in the area of culture that the compromise between its disciplinary impetus to explain via reference to supra-individual phenomena and the common sense notion that individuals are all that exists is tendered  that is, they have an almost pathological unwillingness to understand ideas in an adequately collective manner. Thus while the empirical insights of interactionism remain valuable, the influence of characterlogicism on social theory, and in particular on the sociology of culture, is incapacitating, and the interactionist position is inferior to the structural position, which can account for the analysis of character within a larger study of discourses and collective structures of meaning. This is evidenced by Simmels essay, which begins with the interactional situation, and, through careful theoretical advancement, shows the necessity of a structural approach, not only to institutions, but to culture as well."
0,"This research investigates the child care preferences of poor White, African American and Hispanic parents. Using the factorial survey method, this research examines the impact of race and ethnicity on child care preferences and definitions of child care quality. The findings do not support the conclusion that race and ethnicity are a major source of division in preferences for child care. Rather there was consensus around desired core care attributes associated with child care quality. Across racial and ethnic lines, parents wanted safe and regulated care that was evaluated by a government agency with warm and trained caregivers. Findings suggest that differences in child care use by race and ethnicity may not be due to different preferences for particular types of care, but for bundles of care characteristics people may believe are associated with particular care situations. Different child care choices may not stem from cultural differences, but more from market constraints and lack of information. "
0,"This paper will address the question of Islamic fatalism. Survey data will be used to assess Samuel R Huntington controversial ""Clash of Civilizations"" thesis and its emphasis on fatalism as an inherent characteristic of Islamic religion. The concept of fatalism is expanded and theorized as a function of both structural and theological dimensions. Findings here suggest that fatalism in the Islamic world remains a largely misunderstood phenomenon. Christians living in predominantly Muslim countries are no more fatalistic than their Muslim neighbors, and in Indonesia, Christians report higher levels of fatalism than Indonesian Muslims. However, Muslims do indicate a higher level of belief that cosmological forces control lifer outcomes than do Christians living in those same Islamic societies. Findings also suggest that the effect of Western influence on fatalism is not as straightforward as that predicted by Huntington theory. Fatalism in the Muslim world is best understood in light of complex historical, cultural, economic and socio-political processes and not as a direct outcome of Western influence and/or religious denomination alone."
0,"This study assesses the effect of contact use with individual selection strategies considered. With the assumption that unmeasured and measured variables influence the probability of using contacts and the subsequent outcome simultaneously, I used Endogenous Switching Regression models to estimate the effect of using contacts on income attainment for individuals first jobs. Results show that the income gap between females using and not using contacts is solely because female non contact users are the weakest in the labor market. Rather than them not using contacts per se, their unmeasured traits which do not fit the demands of the labor market make them end up earning the least among male and female contact and non contact users. Using contacts benefits male contact users, but this advantage is based on comparisons with male contact users in a hypothetical situation of them not using contacts. Actually, the difference in income between male contact and non contact users is trivial, since not using contacts does not dampen, but instead benefits income attainment for male non contact users. I thereby argue OLS estimations upwardly biases the effect of using contacts for females, and fail to reflect the positive role of contact use for male contact users."
0,"This paper provides an analysis of the events surrounding the courts-martial of Sabrina Harmon, one of the ""seven bad apples"" associated with the detainee abuse cases at Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq.  Specifically, we use a Parsonian framwork to discuss the many ""instrumental"" and ""expressive"" role themes that emerge from our research at the trials at the Ft. Hood Army Base in Killeen, Texas.  We discuss events as they were described in the courtroon and at Abu Ghraib prison, sworn statements and testimony, conditions at Abu Ghraib prison, US Government Reports, treatment of the detainees, as well as the now infamous photographs depicting the conditions at Abu Ghraib and in Iraq.  Throughout this discussion, we show that the Parsonian distinction between instrumental and expressive roles served a multitude of functions simultaneously, and especially given the masculinist code of the military."
0,"This study involves an investigation into the effectiveness of Catholic and public elementary schools in bringing about Mathematics and Reading achievement over six years of schooling. This is accomplished by modeling achievement growth from the beginning of Kindergarten to the fifth grade using ECLS-K data. This study finds that students who are in public schools during the entire time period of the study make larger gains in Mathematics achievement then do those in Catholic schools. Students who switch from a Catholic to public school during the time period of the study also see similar increases in their rate of Mathematics achievement growth. There are not substantial differences between Catholic and public school students in their rate of Reading achievement growth. Finally, this study finds that opportunities to learn differ consistently between sectors over the time period of this study. Most notably Catholic schools spend significantly less time on Mathematics and Language Arts instruction then do public schools. However, the opportunities to learn factors used in this study do not fully mediate the lower achievement growth of Catholic school students in Mathematics."
0,"Prior research frequently observes a positive cross-sectional relationship between various neighborhood structural characteristics and crime rates, and attributes the causal explanation entirely to these structural characteristics. We question this assumption theoretically, proposing a household-level model showing that neighborhood crime might also change these structural characteristics. We test these hypotheses using data on census tracts in 13 cities over a ten-year period, and our cross-lagged models generally find that, if anything, crime is the stronger causal force in these possible relationships. Neighborhoods with more crime tend to experience increasing levels of residential instability, more concentrated disadvantage, a diminishing retail environment, and more African Americans ten years later. Although we find that neighborhoods with more concentrated disadvantage experience increases in violent and property crime, there is no evidence that residential instability or the presence of African Americans increases crime rates ten years later."

0,"This article tests whether perceptions of ""normal"" defendants influence the use of psychiatric evaluations in the criminal justice system. The author theorizes that typifications-or taken-for-granted assumptions-of African Americans as ""criminals"" and women as ""mentally ill"" will influence court actors' perceptions of the rationality of a defendant's criminal actions. Using case-control sampling methods, the author compiled data from a large Midwestern county to examine the demographic, familial, legal, and psychiatric predictors of which felony defendants receive a psychiatric evaluation; these psychiatric evaluations are indications that the defendant may be considered exempt from criminal responsibility. Using logistic regression, the author finds that mental health status is the best predictor of psychiatric evaluations but that criminal justice decision-makers' attributions of criminal responsibility are also influenced by typifications of defendants based on race and gender."
0,"This visual essay collects and examines select images of persons and groups who have imitated and symbolically simulated the folkloric appearance of the Vodou/Voodoo Loa Baron Samedi in contemporary political and popular culture. Our purpose with this essay is twofold. First, by offering a chronological presentation of “Samedi-esque” imagery, we present a record of appearance that preserves said imagery for comparison, analysis, and critique.  In particular, we are interested in identifying mass media images of Samedi that have helped shape popular understandings of the intersection between ethnicity and the Vodou/Voodoo religion. Second, we explore the various ways these images have been used to invoke fear, promote cultural stereotypes, and generate hope in the performance of ”playing Samedi.”"
0,"Since the end of apartheid, South African marriage laws have expanded to include two previously unrecognized conjugal configurations: marriages solemnized under indigenous or “customary” law, and same-sex couples. Yet, in a technique recalling apartheid, each previously excluded relationship was assigned to its own, segregated statute. In this article, I argue that this puzzling development marks the emergence of a new, multicultural conjugal-recognition regime forged by institutional and semiotic factors. Specifically, I emphasize the dynamics among four linked signs—“marriage,” “culture,” “gender,” and “democracy”—as they played out in post-apartheid political institutions. I use this case to suggest that framing conjugal-recognition policies in terms of regimes allows us to explain them more completely."
0,"Despite a strong interest in media coverage of social problems, sociologists have failed to examine when and why news outlets present issues as problems in need of public action within short time periods. Through content analysis of 475 newspaper articles and negative binomial regression, I show that coverage of homelessness varies in the extent to which it presents homelessness as a social problem. The fact that not all news coverage discusses social problems challenges the claim that social problems necessarily compete for attention in a zero-sum game. I also examine the effects of three types of events (events promoted to the media by their actors and high- and low-profile events not promoted by their actors) on newspapers' likelihood of describing homelessness as a social problem. While previous researchers predicted that events not promoted by their actors would lead to media coverage that challenged the status quo, I find that actor-promoted events are much more likely to do so: This finding highlights the importance of institutionalized action in calling attention to social problems."
0,"Interstate intervention in civil wars has become much more common since 1945, and powerful states such as the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain nearly always achieve their short-term objectives in these interventions.  In the longer run, however, there are many fewer success stories.  Instead, intervention frequently creates lasting domestic instability and antipathy towards the intervening state that undermines the long-term influence of the intervener.  I examine both the short-term and the longer-term outcomes of all Great Power interventions in civil wars since 1945 in terms of whether the target state has a government favorable to the intervening state and whether civil war has recurred in the twenty years following the intervention.  I find that long-term success is more likely when only one Great Power is involved in the intervention and the target country is highly impoverished.  However, these are also the conditions that lead to intractable civil wars in the target state."
0,"This paper examines how Asian Americans who are categorized in a residual category of not quite black and not quite white construct their racial identities by distancing themselves from other racial minorities and use generational status and class as markers of status. Building on the notion of a black/non-black divide or a tri-color stratification, this paper argues that the social position of the children of Asian immigrants is a tenuous position, which begets a constant negotiation of race, class, and generation."
0,"The sociological literature on social movement organizations (SMOs) has come to recognize that under neoliberal globalization many SMOs have moved from an emphasis on the state as the locus of change toward a focus on corporations as targets. This shift has led some SMOs to turn to forms of market-based private regulatory action. The use of one such tactic-voluntary, third-party product certification-has grown substantially, as SMOs seek ways to hold stateless firms accountable. This article explores the case of the international fair trade movement, which aims to change the inequitable terms of global trade in commodities for small farmers, artisans, and waged laborers. Drawing from interviews with a range of fair trade participants, document analysis, and media coverage, the article describes fair trade's growing relationship with multinational coffee firms, particularly Starbucks and Nestle. It explores intra-movement conflicts over the terms for and the effects of corporate participation in fair trade, and illuminates tensions between conceptualizations of fair trade as movement, market, and system: The article makes two arguments. First, while fair trade has succeeded partially in reembedding market exchange within systems of social and moral relations, it has also proved susceptible to the power of corporate actors to disembed the alternative through a process of movement co-optation. Second, it argues that co-optation takes a unique form in the context of social movements whose principal tools to achieve social change are certification and labeling: it occurs primarily on the terrain of standards, in the form of weakening or dilution."
0,"Over the past few decades, disability has become one of the most salient and researched outcomes for older adults in the United States. It is predominantly conceptualized as a life course process and is increasingly measured over time using either transitions or trajectories. In this paper, I extend this research by exploring the pathways through which socioeconomic status affects disability as a life course process. Previous theory and research on SES and health suggests that education and financial resources work through both shared and independent mechanisms. I find that mediators do differ in their impact on education and income effects, and differ for disability onset and growth over time. I discuss these findings in terms of past and future research, focusing on what may be gained by focusing on disability as a life course process made up of transitions within trajectories."
0,"Understanding how the idea of culture is mobilized in discursive contests is crucial for both theorizing and building multicultural democracies. To investigate this, I analyze a debate over whether we should relieve the ""cultural need"" for infibulation among immigrants by offering a ""nick"" in U.S. hospitals. Using interviews, newspaper coverage, and primary documents, I show that physicians and opponents of the procedure with contrasting models of culture disagreed on whether it represented cultural change. Opponents argued that the ""nick"" was fairly described as ""female genital mutilation"" and symbolically identical to more extensive cutting. Using a reified model, they imagined Somalis to be ""culture-bound""; the adoption of a ""nick"" was simply a move from one genital cutting procedure to another. Unable to envision meaningful cultural adaptation, and presupposing the incompatibility of multiculturalism and feminism, they supported forced assimilation. Physicians, drawing on a dynamic model of culture, believed that adoption of the ""nick"" was meaningful cultural change, but overly idealized their ability to protect Somali girls from both Somali and U.S. patriarchy. Unduly confident, they failed to take oppression seriously, dismissing relevant constituencies and their concerns."
0,"An intersectional feminist approach informs qualitative content analyses of gender and trade advocacy websites in order to gain insights into the relation between trade liberalization and women in the global South. Findings include these websites are advocating for more representation in policymaking institutions spanning the global and local divide; emphasizing the need for networks within and outside institutions; and advocating for alternatives to free trade. The diverse and often contradictory understandings and strategies displayed by these websites arise from concern with giving voice to local needs and women in the South. These findings underscore the contributions a feminist approach makes to global political economy research by bringing attention to the heterogeneity of global political economic processes and power relations, and providing insights as to how global counter-hegemonic efforts can embrace diversity rather than being homogenizing."
0,"Managers careers and career orientations have changed significantly since the era of organizational change that began around 20-30 years ago.  This paper focuses on how managers have responded to these changes.  It suggests that there is evidence of a significant change in the kinds of capital that managers mobilise, and the uses to which they put it.  At least some managers now mobilise a form of human capital in the form of reputations that are grounded in informal networks that constitute managers social capital.  For various reasons, managers find this melded social/human capital difficult to stabilise and therefore risky to hold.  Evidence is presented that they attempt to convert it into wealth  economic capital.  The paper considers the extent and implications of these developments."
0,We present an elaboration of the status cues extension (Fi&#351;ek et al. 2005) of the formal theory of status characteristics and expectation states (Berger et al. 1977).  This elaboration makes it possible to apply the mathematical model of the theory to status situations where multiple standards and graded characteristics are salient.  We examine the fit of the model to data from four experiments conducted in the standardized experimental situation of expectation states theory which involve multiple standards of graded characteristics.  We show that the model fits the data well.
0,"In this article, the author details how 16-18-year-old boys ascribe to the tenets of inclusive masculinity in a U.K. secondary school that the author calls ""Standard High."" Drawing on five months of participant observation and twelve in-depth interviews, this article demonstrates that the boys' masculinities are predicated in opposition to the orthodox values of homophobia, misogyny, and aggressiveness. Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists. Here, boys are stratified in accordance to a popularity ranking, which is determined by the possession of a matrix of variables: namely, charisma, authenticity, emotional support, and social fluidity."
0,"The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to examine whether the effect of late-life widowhood on social support is moderated by five different personality traits: agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, and openness to experience; and (2) to evaluate whether the distinguishing aspects of personality moderate the link between widowhood and social support differently for widows versus widowers. These questions were examined using data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study, a multiwave prospective study of widowhood in later life. Results indicate that individuals scoring higher on openness and agreeableness experienced greater social support from children upon spousal loss relative to their peers scoring lower on these traits. Agreeableness also was found to moderate the link between widowhood and support from friends and relatives; yet the effect was in the opposite direction. Individuals scoring higher on agreeableness experienced less support from friends and relatives compared to their peers scoring lower on this trait. Further, findings reveal gender differences with higher levels of extraversion predicting greater support from children for widows yet not for widowers. Finally, while being more conscientious predicts less support from children for widowers, results reveal no effect of this trait for widows. Overall findings highlight the importance of assessing in addition to structural contexts, individual-level factors conditioning the effects of late-life widowhood on social support."
0,"Emotions have held a central place in sociological understandings of the self, both as a facet of identity management and as an outcome of primarily cognitive self processes such as reflected appraisals. In this paper, we extend research on emotions by suggesting that emotions need to also be theorized as having the potential to shape individuals understandings of who they are. To develop our ideas, we draw upon existing control models of the self that provide a theoretical account of cognitive processes in the production of emotion and identity change. We then extend this model to include emotion as another source of identity change and empirically examine our ideas using a longitudinal sample of newly married couples, focusing on the mood disorder of depression. While we do not find that discrepancies between individuals identities and others views affect depression, we do find that individuals identities change to become consistent with the views of others. We also find that, when compared to reflected appraisals, emotion is an equally powerful source of identity change."
0,"My research examines the process by which job-seekers access information through social networks. In this paper I focus on one aspect of this process: the decisions that information-holders make to share or withhold information. I interview people employed in entry-level white-collar work, to determine what roles they play in their network members job searches, and find that given the knowledge of a job opening and given the identification of a suitable recipient for this information, information holders are most likely to transfer information to their network members who a) they believe will perform well on the job b)  they know to be looking for similar information, and c) they have the opportunity to tell during encounters initiated for other purposes. I then argue that when dealing with jobs in open labour markets such as the one I study, these conditions are more likely to be met by strong ties than by weak ties.  Properties of the labour market in which the search is conducted mediate the effect of tie strength. In closed labour markets where jobs require  and job searchers have  greater specialization, information-holders are able to evaluate a weak ties information needs and fit with a job. In open labour-markets information holders lack the information necessary to appraise weak ties career goals or suitability for jobs. Under these circumstances, information-holders limit their information transfer to those ties of whom they have enough knowledge to be relatively assured that the information they provide will not be unwelcome."
0,"This research investigates the state social control of intergroup conflict by assessing the sociopolitical determinants of hate crime prosecutions. Consistent with insights from the political sociology of punishment, group-threat accounts of intergroup relations and the state, and neoinstitutional theory, the findings suggest that hate crime prosecutions are fewer where political conservatism, Christian fundamentalism, and black population size are higher, although this last effect is nonlinear. Linkages between district attorneys' offices and communities, on the other hand, increase hate crime prosecutions and the likelihood of offices' creating hate crime policies. Yet these policies are sometimes decoupled from actual enforcement, and such decoupling is more likely in politically conservative districts. The results indicate that common correlates of criminal punishment have very different effects on types of state social control that are protective of minority groups, and also suggest conditions under which policy and practice become decoupled in organizational settings."
0,"Women now surpass men in college completion and women attain bachelor's and graduate degrees at rates that equal or exceed men’s. Despite this progress, sex segregation in fields of study persists. Men are more likely than women to major in science, particularly physical science and engineering, and data indicate that gender convergence among science majors is not likely in the near future. Explanations for the persisting shortfall of women in the physical sciences and engineering must account for broader trends in education and the consequences of women's major choice for their careers and family lives. Using data from the 1980 to 2000 Census and the 2005 American Community Survey we analyze trends over time in highly-educated women's occupational choices and the consequences of their choices in terms of marriage, fertility and earnings. Women’s career choices, especially in high-status, demanding occupations in the sciences, have consequences for all three outcomes."
0,"Spending time in prison has become an increasingly common life event for low-skill minority men in the United States. The Bureau of Justice Statistics now estimates that one in three black men can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. A growing body of work implicates the prison system in contemporary accounts of racial inequality across a host of social, health, economic, and political domains. However, comparatively little work has examined the impact of the massive increase in the prison system-and growing inequality in exposure to the prison system-on racial inequality over the life course. Using a unique data set drawn from state administrative records, this project examines how spending time in prison affects wage trajectories for a cohort of men over a 14-year period. Multilevel growth curve models show no evidence of racial divergence in wages in quarters leading up to incarceration. However, after release, wages grow at a 21 percent slower rate for black compared to white ex-inmates. Blacks also enjoy fewer wage returns to work history compared to their white counterparts. This research broadens our understanding of the sources of racial stratification over the life course and underscores the relevance of recent policy interventions in the lives of low-skilled minority men."
0,"Recent research on the collective identity label described as Asian American, which was originally formulated as a political movement symbol, shows only some support among the various Asian ethnic groups that reside in the United States at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Based on a sample of second-generation Asian American student leaders in four public universities, this study provides empirical evidence that the definition of the term Asian American has multiplied as a result of major demographic and cultural factors that have affected the Asian population. These definitions reflect ethnic and religious diversification as well as the model minority stereotype and a cohort identity for the second-generation experience. At the same time, this diversification of definitions is also influenced by two concurrent and interlacing cultural discourses, one that emphasizes the racialized otherness of being ""Asian American"" and another that emphasizes the cultural diversity within this racial label. Implications for future research and theoretical development follow."
0,"This article examines letters to the editor as one of the ways citizens seek to enact a public sphere using technological mediation. Using a sample of all letters received by a metropolitan newspaper during a three-month period (N = 1,113), the authors demonstrate that the tone and argumentative styles of letters differ with the scope of the issues the letters address. Local issues evoke more reasoned, conciliatory tones, while issues beyond the local context evoke more emotional, confrontational tones, even after controlling for individual writers' characteristics and anger as a motivation to write."
0,"Opposition to the Iraq War is thought to have contributed to the election of Barack Obama as president in 2008. The present study shows that, controlling for other factors, including the percent of the vote going to the pre-war Democratic presidential candidate, states with relatively high levels of Iraq War military fatalities had a higher percent vote for Obama. This result is consistent with a prediction derived from rational political theory and the results of several studies examining the impacts of war fatality rates in other military conflicts in previous elections.  However, in the current study we find that the effect of Iraq war fatalities on the percent vote for Obama is conditioned by state military enlistment rates. Military casualties have a strong effect in states with historically lower than demographically expected levels of military enlistment. But the effect disappears in states with higher than demographically expected levels of military enlistment"
0,"This study investigates the determinants of social trustin people in general, in neighbors, and in coworkersamong African Americans, Hispanics, and whites, using data from the 2000 American National Election Study. As predicted, African Americans have lower generalized trust in people, neighbors, and coworkers than whites do. Hispanics have lower generalized trust in people and neighbors than whites, but are no less trusting of coworkers. When socioeconomic status was controlled, Hispanics did not differ from whites on any aspect of social trust. For all three groups, perceived trustworthiness of whites, African Americans, and Hispanics (but not of Asians) was positively related to trust in people. Surprisingly, however, trust of African Americans and Hispanics had far stronger effects than trust of whites. Trust in various ethnic groups had no effect on trust in neighbors or trust in coworkers. For all three groups, living in a majority-white neighborhood was positively related to trust in people and trust in neighbors, and having mostly white coworkers was positively related to trust in coworkers."
0,"Previous research on Ogbu&#8217;s (1978) oppositional culture hypothesis (or resistance model), which posits that ethnic minorities resist school goals by adopting behaviors and attitudes that compromise their school achievement, have tested the theory by assessing whether minorities in high school differ from Whites on schooling behaviors and attitudes.  However, we posit that students&#8217; skill level prior to high school may be an important omitted factor that biases the effect that schooling behaviors and attitudes have on achievement.  Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS), we examine the extent to which the effects of behaviors and attitudes remain important for achievement once prior skills are controlled.  There are two noteworthy findings that have implications for the resistance model.  First, the effects of students&#8217; behaviors and attitudes during high school on both reading and math achievement decline significantly once their prior skill levels are taken into account.  Second, while schooling behaviors and attitudes have no implications for the Black-White achievement gap, accounting for prior skills closes the gaps in both reading and math by 66 and 73 percent, respectively.  Schooling behaviors explain the Asian advantage relative to Whites in math, however.  These findings suggest that the apparent effect of behaviors and attitudes during high school on achievement is mostly a function of the particular skill set students possess when they enter high school.  We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the oppositional culture theory. Specifically, whether the importance currently attributed to behaviors and attitudes should be reassessed."
0,"Attributions of panic are almost exclusively directed at members of the general public. Here, we inquire into the relationships between elites and panic. We review current research and theorizing about panic, including problems of identifying when it has occurred. We propose three relationships: elites fearing panic, elites causing panic and elites panicking. We use numerous examples, including our own research on the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, to illustrate how these relationships operate. The argument is evocative, not definitive. However, the conceptual utility of explicitly theorizing the relationships between elites and panic shows, among other things, how power works in disasters."
0,"Previous research has shown that adults who report experiences of childhood maltreatment are less likely to be involved in religion, but a reliance on cross-sectional samples of adults may obscure a positive relationship between experiences of child maltreatment and change in religious involvement over time.  Use of cross-sectional samples also obviates the possibility of studying the social-psychological factors underlying this relationship.  In this research, latent growth curve modeling is used to examine how physical and emotional maltreatment by parents is related to religious involvement in a national probability sample of 10th grade boys, as well as change in religious involvement until one year past high school.  Whether these relationships are mediated by two social-psychological mechanismsloss of meaning and conflict with authorityis also investigated.  Parental maltreatment is negatively related to initial levels of religious involvement, but is positively related to change in religious involvement over time.  Victims loss of meaning and tendency to conflict with authority at least partially explain both relationships, but conflict with authority is negatively related to change over time, while loss of meaning is positively related to change in religious involvement.  Physical and emotional maltreatment by parents appears to leave victims religiously ambivalentdrawn towards religion because of a need to re-establish a sense of meaning, but propelled away due to a tendency to conflict with authority."
0,"Population migration can have dramatic health effects (e.g., the Spanish introduction of smallpox to New World inhabitants). Health effects can also be subtle, especially given the long latency of diseases such as cancers. Separately, places in the U.S. may be ranked as persistently healthy and unhealthy places, based on a variety of health measures. As such, we investigate how socioeconomic factors and population migration relate to the relative health of these counties.  Assessment of the stable population is necessary to correctly determine the at-risk population for either the incidence or prevalence of morbidity/mortality within a population. Further, understanding population migration flows can reveal the role that place versus the population or community play in morbidity and mortality outcomes.  Using mortality as a health outcome and socioeconomic factors as controls, we test the importance of county-level population stability and in-migration.  Population in-migration is negatively associated with mortality rates except in already unhealthy places, while population stability (non-movers) is positively associated with mortality rates no matter how counties are grouped. This finding supports previous research from other countries, indicating that healthy people move from unhealthy places while unhealthy people remain in unhealthy places. This is also supportive of parallel research in the migration patterns of the poor, in which migration is found to maintain and reinforce spatial concentrations of poverty. We conclude that migration and stability reinforce the health status of county populations and plan to examine in more detail the migration patterns among healthy and unhealthy places in future research."
0,"Arguments about the spread of gender egalitarian values through the population highlight several sources of change. First, structural arguments point to increases in the proportion of women with high education, jobs with good pay, commitment to careers outside the family, and direct interests in gender equality. Second, value shift arguments contend that gender norms change with social and economic development among women and men in diverse positions-traditional and non-traditional alike. Third, diffusion arguments suggest that structural change leads to adoption of new ideas and values supportive of gender equality by non-traditional and innovative groups in society, but that the new ideas later diffuse to other groups through cultural processes. Using the General Social Survey from 1977 to 2006 and comparing the determinants of gender egalitarianism across 86 cohorts born from roughly 1900 through 1985, multilevel models support the diffusion arguments."
0,"We draw upon social disorganization theory to examine the effects of community characteristics on the distribution of offsite alcohol outlets in San Diego County, California. Of particular interest is whether alcohol availability varies according to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition once measures of social disorganization (socioeconomic disadvantage, residential instability, and racial/ethnic heterogeneity) are controlled. Using data from the 1990 Census and 1993 alcohol license reports, we estimate a series of negative binomial regression models with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. The results show that percent Asian is associated with lower offsite alcohol outlet density. Once socioeconomic disadvantage is controlled, percent Latino is related to lower alcohol availability. Although similar suppressor patterns are observed, percent Black is generally unrelated to outlet density. Consistent with social disorganization theory, socioeconomic disadvantage and residential instability predict increased alcohol availability. Neighborhood racial/ethnic composition is either unrelated or inversely related to outlet density once social disorganization and other neighborhood characteristics are taken into account. "
0,"We compare neighborhoods with more traditional features in two very different cities. As expected, in Portland, the majority are socially diverse and in Atlanta they are low-income.  In both cities about a quarter however are high-income.  In Atlanta the latter are located in older neighborhoods whereas in Portland, they are also in areas combining newer and older housing.  A return to valuing a more traditional urbanism may explain the signs of revitalized central cities in both places.  Our findings however indicate it may be accompanied by the relocation of low-income neighborhoods to areas where activities are not readily accessible."
0,"Using a hazards framework and panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey Of Youth (1979-2004), we analyze the fertility patterns of a recent cohort of white and black women in the United States. We examine how completed fertility varies by women's education, differentiating between intended and unintended births. We find that the education gradient on fertility comes largely from unintended childbearing, and it is not explained by child-bearing desires or opportunity costs, the two most common explanations in previous research. Less-educated women want no more children than die more educated, so this factor explains none of their higher completed fertility. Less-educated women have lower wages, but wages have little of the negative effect on fertility predicted by economic theories of opportunity cost. We propose three other potential mechanisms linking low education and unintended childbearing, focusing on access to contraception and abortion, relational and economic uncertainty, and consistency in the behaviors necessary to avoid unintended pregnancies. Our work highlights the need to incorporate these mechanisms into future research."
0,"The theoretical perspectives informing studies of the factors motivating engagement in political violence point to both national and individual-level processes.  However, to date, quantitative research on this issue has focused its attention primarily on national-level factors and outcomes.  Using a relatively new and underutilized data source, I analyze the effects of both macro-level contextual factors and individual perceptions of economic and political inequality and exclusion on individual openness to the use of political violence in 16 Sub-Saharan African nations.  In examining individual-level outcomes, I also provide a much needed quantitative examination of the effect of gender on individual openness to the use of political violence.  Independent of the effect of national political and economic context the results of the study indicate that gender, perception of relative economic position, and perceived political efficacy significantly affect engagement in political violence and belief in the legitimacy of the use of political violence.  Additionally, the underlying mechanisms motivating the belief that the use of political violence is a legitimate form of political action are shown to differ for men and women in the region."
0,"Developing an understanding of the relationship between issue framing and collective identity construction is vital to the understanding of any social movement. Unfortunately, these concepts have been largely separate in the social movement literature. Through qualitative content analysis, I explore the relationship between the collective identity production and issue framing that occurs during union organizing campaigns. This study demonstrates the value of studying collective identity through frame theory, that labor unions can be effectively studied as social movements, and that multiple types of framing may occur simultaneously."
0,"What are the keys to growing community in voluntary associations?  One prominent explanation is the ability of organizations to draw in pre-existing social networks.  This study draws on rich longitudinal data from an online discussion system to investigate how of social network structure might help explain the differential growth of community in voluntary associations.  We compare the volume and structure of invitation and participation between two subgroups:  an initial core of predominately English language speakers and an emergent and rapidly growing population of Chinese language population.  We document substantial differences between the groups in size, rates of growth, invitation rates, success rates of invitations, and the levels of activity.  We visualize network structure prior to, during, and after the period of meteoric growth in the CLP which reveals substantial differences in network structure between the sub-populations.  The observed patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that the CLP drew in preexisting social networks more effectively.  In our next draft of this paper we test this hypothesis by using a variety of network measures to predict subsequent activity rates.  We conclude by considering implications for participation in and growth of communities of collective action and the role of computer mediated data in that research."
0,"During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Pentagon introduced a program ""embedding"" journalists in military units. Embedded reporters have been widely criticized for allegedly failing to adequately cover effects of the war on Iraqi civilians, while over-emphasizing the personal lives of troops. Proponents of the embedding program argue that the program provides journalists with a detailed understanding of military culture and life on the frontline. In addition to the embedded reporters, some journalists were stationed in Baghdad and others were independent and free to roam. I argue that these three journalistic vantage points channeled reporters toward particular news content, while limiting their access to others. I hypothesize that while embedded reporters effectively presented the military experience of the war and the Baghdad-stationed reporters successfully covered the Iraqi experience of the war, the independent reporters were able to provide the most balanced coverage of the war. I demonstrate that despite the largely one-sided story presented, articles by embedded journalists were both more prominent and more widely available than coverage from other vantage points. Due to the dominance of embedded reporting, I conclude by noting that the majority of war coverage in print media heavily emphasized the soldier's experience of the war, while downplaying the effects of the invasion on the Iraqi people. By conducting a content analysis of 742 print news articles by 156 journalists from the major combat period of the war, this study offers one of the first systematic documentations of the substantive content of Iraq war coverage."
0,"Previous research on womens experiences with infertility has been conducted almost exclusively on upper middle class women.  While this research has demonstrated the devastating effects of infertility on well-being, we do not know to what extent to which this is a function of middle and upper middle class status.  Using data from in-depth interviews and a web survey this paper explores how the infertility experience is different for lower middle/working class women than it is for middle/upper middle class women.  While all women in the study were profoundly affected by their infertility, the lower middle/working class women were more likely to report a sense of loss of purpose in life and to completely reevaluate their lives in light of their infertility struggles.  It is argued that the lower middle/working class women are more profoundly affected by infertility for several reasons.  First, for most lower middle/working class women in this study, motherhood was to be their major role in life, these were primarily not career track women.  Many of the upper middle/middle class women had careers that provided them with a sense of identity, this was not so for the lower middle/working class women.  Second, lower middle/working class women did not have the resources to pursue either infertility treatments nor adoption.  For lower middle/working class women infertility often equaled a childless life.  Upper middle/middle class women had the resources to pursue treatments, and also had enough money to pursue adoption if treatments failed."
0,"This study is the first to investigate charitable giving to as many as 64 different organizations, predicting what type of charitable organization receives donations from which particular people. We test hypotheses with conditional logistic regression analysis, using the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (N(households) = 1246; N(organizations) = 64). We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence. "
0,"Historically, in the West, such heavily freighted terms as freedom, democracy, citizenship and civility reflect centuries of philosophical contemplation and political struggle toward these ends.  In non-western societies, these loaded terms were not usually indigenously produced and elaborated. It does not mean, however, that people did not exhibit their desire for constructing freer social relations by experimenting with new organizational forms of networks and by producing distinctive cultures of sociability. The historical study of associational life, in particular the formation of horizontal associations, has gained renewed interest in social scientific literature (e.g., Putnam 1992) because of the positive implications for the qualities of civil society and democracy. Nonetheless, so far too little attention has been given to the importance of weak ties in this context, and of casual, flexible social interactions, and ephemeral human voluntary associations, which have historically provided society with increased flexibility by providing open circuits. Using civility and weak-ties as key words, this paper examines the practice of premodern Japanese people's cultural and social experiments of bridging people horizontally.  I maintain that civility implies a grammar of sociability that is suitable for less committed social relationships, that is to say, interactions mediated by weak ties. It was in this context that early modern Japan revitalized art and poetry circles as centers of communicative activity and spheres of civility. Compared to feudal political ties or primordial territorial and kinship ties that enforced heavy obligations and life-long commitment, that is to say strong ties, these circles represented more or less weak ties, in the sense of Mark Granovetters usage. In fact, it was through the availability of these casual and flexible network connections and the spread of Japan's aesthetic cultural image and idioms that Japan produced a sense of commonality and cultural citizenship well before the rise of the modern nation state in the late 19th century."
0,"In this paper I examine the relationship between falling union membership and the ratio of median managerial to median worker pay among full-time workers between 1983 and 2000.  Not only does a large union presence at the industry-region level boost median worker pay, but it is additionally associated with slightly higher mid-level managerial pay, as the union wage premium reverberates up the pay scale.  However, despite this positive association with both median worker and managerial pay, union decline widens wage dispersion within the workplace.  I attribute this finding to the political pressure unions exert on management for more equitable pay."
0,"Current survey research reveals that religious conservatives exhibit more punitive attitudes toward criminal offenders than their nonreligious and mainline counterparts. Despite the pervasiveness of conservative Protestant support for the punitive treatment of criminal offenders, evangelical-run prison ministry programs have proliferated in recent decades. This study uses in-depth interviews to examine the motivations of prison ministry workers. The narratives demonstrate that prison ministry workers embrace a distinctive orientation of compassion and, through sustained contact with inmates, they negotiate the tension between conservative religious values and their practical experiences working in prison ministry. From this overarching theme of compassion, three important subthemes emerged: (1) the calling of prison ministry, (2) special connections to the prison context, and (3) a sense of comfort and security with inmates. Overall, we observe how prison ministers negotiate two competing moral logics-judgment and compassion-in light of their religious convictions and experiences with inmate outreach."
0,"This paper uses life history interviews with 75 men and women between the ages 28 and 35 to develop a theoretical model about how young adults construct marital commitment.  It locates two distinct yet related dimensions of marital commitment, a value-rational and a practical, and borrows concepts from exchange and identity models of commitment to analyze interpretive processes involved in constructing these two dimensions.  Some preliminary comments on the dynamic nature of this model in relation to the life-course, interaction contexts, and gender are articulated and implications of this model discussed.  I conclude that one-dimensional views of marital commitment are insufficient and suggest that by attending to both value-rational and practical processes, we gain a better understanding of contemporary variation."
0,"Two long-standing research problems of interest to sociologists are sources of variations in social inequalities and differential contributions of the temporal dimensions of age, time period, and cohort to variations in social phenomena. Recently, scholars have introduced a model called Variance Function Regression for the study of the former problem, and a model called Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort regression has been developed for the study of the latter. This article presents an integration of these two models as a means to study the evolution of social inequalities along distinct temporal dimensions. We apply the integrated model to survey data on subjective health status. We find substantial age, period, and cohort effects, as well as gender differences, not only for the conditional mean of self-rated health (i.e., between-group disparities), but also for the variance in this mean (i.e., within-group disparities)-and it is detection of age, period, and cohort variations in the latter disparities that application of the integrated model permits. Net of effects of age and individual-level covariates, in recent decades, cohort differences in conditional means of self-rated health have been less important than period differences that cut across all cohorts. By contrast, cohort differences of variances in these conditional means have dominated period differences. In particular, post-baby boom birth cohorts show significant and increasing levels of within-group disparities. These findings illustrate how the integrated model provides a powerful framework through which to identify and study the evolution of variations in social inequalities across age, period, and cohort temporal dimensions. Accordingly, this model should be broadly applicable to the study of social inequality in many different substantive contexts."
0,"Racial disparities in medical care and medical outcomes, including birth outcomes, are well documented. One example of disparity cited in the medical literature is that white women use epidurals more often in labor than do women from other racial and ethnic groups. This difference in epidural usage has been framed by medical researchers as women of color not having the same access to anesthesia during labor that white women have. Drawing on interviews with 83 women the day after they gave birth at a tertiary care hospital in Connecticut, I find that women are not denied access to epidurals but rather are pressured into having epidurals and that this pressure takes on an offensive tone toward some women of color. Women of color are also more like than white women to suffer the most severe negative effects of anesthesia failure and over anesthetization.  This research is suggestive of racialization of care. Occupational segregation by race is a structural issue, and it affects patient care because ideologies based on race, which according to Patricia Hill Collins’ work put Black women’s mothering abilities in a negative light, are brought into the organization by caregivers and are displayed as they interact with patients."
0,"Studies have often found evidence to suggest that racial profiling does not exist for Asian Americans.  In this study, I suggest that researchers may have overlooked cases without fully understanding race in its social context, especially for Asian Americans.  The study hopes to elucidate the possibility of racial profiling by understanding race through the use of narratives of local racial and ethnic minorities.  Becoming racially sensitized may allow a researcher to better understand a case of racial profiling, and it may equip the researcher with better tools to discover racial profiling."
0,"Alcohol use and abuse on American college campuses has raised significant concerns among university officials, scholars, and social critics. One of the principal concerns is that heavy drinking is associated with risky sexual behavior and sexual victimization among college samples. The current study seeks to enhance our understanding regarding the relationship between alcohol intoxication and sex by investigating the ways in which college students use alcohol as a tool to facilitate, explain, and justify sexual encounters and casual coupling (e.g., kissing, omaking out,o petting, touching). Guided by theoretical perspectives designed to explain the role of rhetoric in explaining and justifying deviant behavior, we analyze 469 qualitative odrinking storieso and 32 interviews collected at three university sites. Our findings suggest that college drinkers view alcohol as a disinhibiting force that elevates the potential for sexuality and that alcohol intoxication is also used as a resource to justify casual coupling events, before and after they occur. Finally, our respondents describe the informal strategies they have developed to negotiate the potential for risky sexual encounters in an environment where disinhibited actors draw from widely available cultural scripts to excuse and justify untoward behavior."
0,"How do multiracial groups ""fit"" into the system of racial oppression and privilege in the United States? Are the outcomes of multiracial individuals explained by the Latin Americanization hypothesis (Bonilla-Silva 2002), or a hardening racial divide between blacks and all other racial groups (Gans 1999; Yancey 2006)? Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I address these questions and show that the educational outcomes of multiracial groups and individuals are not consistently explained by measures of appearance, as suggested by these theories. Although the educational outcomes of Latinos and single-race groups are significantly associated with skin color and the racial perceptions of observers, multiracial young adults' high school and college educational outcomes are not consistently related to either measure of appearance. Parental education and family income are the most important predictors of educational outcomes for multiracial respondents across different types of outcomes. The implications of these findings for racial inequality and research on multiracial groups are discussed."
0,"This paper extends research on the multidimensionality of racial prejudice by applying Fiske and Glicks Ambivalent Prejudice typology to white inter-racial attitudes towards blacks, Asians, and Hispanics.  It tests Glick and Fiskes predictions about the effects of perceived socioeconomic status and perceived threat on the different types of prejudice:  admiration, contemptuous prejudice, paternalistic prejudice, and envious prejudice.  Results indicate support for the prediction that higher perceptions of socioeconomic status increase the probability whites will express admiration over contempt and paternalistic prejudice for all racial groups.  Evidence also supports the prediction that higher perceptions of threat will increase the probability of expressing contempt over admiration and paternalistic prejudice for all groups.   Results also show that the effects of perceived socioeconomic status and perceived threat on inter-racial attitudes vary according to target race.  There is also evidence that Fiske and Glicks typology is more nuanced than expected, especially with respect to ambivalent prejudices."

0,"When is employment discrimination acceptable?  The notion of a bona fide occupational requirement is central in both the United States and Canada to determining the legal permissibility of discriminatory choices by employers.  There are grounds on which employees or potential employees cannot be legally discriminated against, such as sex, race, religion, age, and disability.  However, employers are free to make employment decisions that discriminate so long as those decisions are based on an employees ability to meet a bona fide occupational requirement.  This paper explores the evolution of what constitutes a bona fide occupational requirement in Canadian case law, focusing on the period 1982 to 1992.  This paper describes the boundaries that were drawn between acceptable and unacceptable discrimination, and highlight how those decisions were subject to two particular social influences  changing public conceptions of risk and safety and changing public moral and aesthetic preferences."
0,"In this study, we measure the contribution of immigrants and their descendents to the growth and industrial transformation of the American workforce in the age of mass immigration from 1880 to 1920. The size and selectivity of the immigrant community, as well as their disproportionate residence in large cities, meant they were the mainstay of the American industrial workforce. Immigrants and their children comprised over half of manufacturing workers in 1920, and if the third generation (the grandchildren of immigrants) are included, then more than two-thirds of workers in the manufacturing sector were of recent immigrant stock. Although higher wages and better working conditions might have encouraged more long-resident native-born workers to the industrial economy, the scale and pace of the American industrial revolution might well have slowed. The closing of the door to mass immigration in the 1920s did lead to increased recruitment of native born workers, particularly from the South, to northern industrial cities in the middle decades of the 20th century.

0,"The achievement of long-term participation in sporting activities, in spite of the many competing demands of middle class motherhood, is unlikely and calls for explanation.  Based on in-depth interviews with women who are athletes as well as being mothers, and often partners/spouses, this work investigates the “infrastructure” required in achieving an athletic version of middle class motherhood.  Within the social context of middle class motherhood, there is very little (if any) time left unaccounted for, so that much is required to negotiate and create a space for engaging in serious sporting activities.  Adequately training for a marathon or an Iron Man competition is an extraordinary feat for primary caretakers of young children, with or without the added element of paid work.  By hook or by crook the women in this study carve out time, space and money for these serious sporting activities.  This paper examines personal and circumstantial traits that constitute the foundation upon which the participants build their sporting pursuits."
0,"The authors use employment histories from survey data to examine personal network use and stratification in the Russian labor market from 1985 to 2001. Institutional changes associated with the Soviet collapse increased the use of networks and shaped their prevalence and benefits in theoretically coherent ways. In Russia, networks positively affect job quality, whether measured by occupation, current earnings, or wage arrears. These findings relate to recent debates over whether job contacts provide advantages and how social capital relates to postsocialist inequalities involving gender, Communist Party membership, and education. Russia also exhibits a previously overlooked relationship between network use and locality type."
0,"People who have grown up with digital media are often assumed to be universally savvy with information and communication technologies. Such assumptions are rarely grounded in empirical evidence, however. This article draws on unique data with information about a diverse group of young adults' Internet uses and skills to suggest that even when controlling for Internet access and experiences, people differ in their online abilities and activities. Additionally, findings suggest that Internet know-how is not randomly distributed among the population, rather, higher levels of parental education, being a male, and being white or Asian American are associated with higher levels of Web-use skill. These user characteristics are also related to the extent to which young adults engage in diverse types of online activities. Moreover, skill itself is positively associated with types of uses. Overall, these findings suggest that even when controlling for basic Internet access, among a group of young adults, socioeconomic status is an important predictor of how people are incorporating the Web into their everyday lives with those from more privileged backgrounds using it in more informed ways for a larger number of activities."

0,"We use data from the British Household Panel Survey to explore the pattern and dynamics of the exchange of instrumental support between adult children and their non-coresident parents.  Viewed in the cross-section, the level of actual instances of intergenerational exchange in contemporary Britain is rather low.  Viewed longitudinally, we report an asymmetric pattern in the ebb and flow of exchange, with stopping probabilities being multiples higher than starting probabilities.  Furthermore, when the finance or health of adult children worsens, parental help is often not forthcoming, but when their finance and health improves, parental help is likely to be scaled back.  Nonetheless, there is evidence that parents and adult children are supportive of each other at critical moments of life transitions, such as divorce, the birth of a child, or widowhood.  Together, these results paint a nuanced picture of the significance of the extended family in contemporary Britain, and give qualified support to the latent kin matrix hypothesis."
0,"Citizenship is one of the most enduring political ideas, and the concept of global citizenship has gained tremendous momentum in recent years in academic debate and public discourse around the world.  For the most part, however, contemporary accounts of global citizenship have emerged in considerable detachment from political arenas at all levels.  This paper outlines five barriers that are interpreted as keeping the idea of global citizenship largely uncoupled from the arenas of national politics and global governance and explores how the concept generally has been advanced much more forcefully within the educational sector, the business sector, and civil society organizations.  Why is it that the specific idea of global citizenship has yet to motivate substantial political action?   And which elements of global citizenship discourse seem best poised to facilitate a more expressly political model of global citizenship?  Closer examination of the current obstacles facing a political model of global citizenship can lend insight in addressing such questions."
0,"this paper examines the effect of son preference on the hazards of having a second and a third birth. With data from South Koreas 2000 National Fertility Rate and Family Health Survey by the KIHSA (the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs), the hazards of having a second birth among 5,670 married women who have a first birth, and the hazard of having a third birth among  4,325 married women who had two births were examined. These two hazards were analyzed by estimating Cox proportional hazard model. The major covariate in the first analysis is whether or not the first-born was a daughter. In the second analysis the main covariate is whether both of the first two children were girls. In both models five covariates known to have independent effects on the transition to a second (or third) birth are controlled for, namely, her age at the birth of the first (or second) child, whether she lives in urban area, and three dummy variables reflecting her level of education. The results show the important influence of son preference and the family pressure on it on the hazard of having a second baby. Comparing South Koreas results with those of China, China hazards models were more perfect than those of South Korea, and the association between son preference and fertility of China was stronger than that of South Korea."
0,"This paper examines the experiences of a group of young Muslims following the events of September 11, 2001. I begin with a brief overview of the social psychological literature regarding ethnic and religious identification. Next, I discuss the setting in which this study was conducted, the methods that were used, and the research participants. Through a qualitative in-depth analysis, the dynamic interplay between ethnic and religious identity and minority group status is explored. The contradictions, pressures, and consequences associated with dual religious and ethnic minority status in the United States post-September 11 is examined. This research illustrates the individual and social implications of religious and ethnic identity salience and negotiation, and offers directions for future research."
0,"This paper assesses social movement organizations’ and interest groups’ access to Congressional committee hearings, adapting two theories of the legislative institutional context. The reelection hypothesis is that legislators will grant access based on advocacy groups’ ability to assist and pressure reelection campaigns, while the informational hypothesis is that legislators will offer access based on groups’ technical expertise in policy production. Analysis uses data about networks of advocacy groups in health policy 1977-1980 from Laumann and Knoke’s (1987) The Organizational State. After assessing the organizational configuration of the health policy field during this era, Poisson regression models are used to predict appearances to testify at committee hearings. Results do not support a reelection-centered perspective on access to committee hearings: advocacy groups’ capacities to affect legislators’ reelection prospects are poor predictors of access. Policy expertise is the most substantial predictor of access to committee hearings, supporting an informational perspective. Implications for future theory and modeling are discussed."
0,"Previous research has found that Americans evidence deep and intractable racial/ethnic divisions concerning their explanations for racial inequality, divisions that are often widened and fortified by religion (Edgell and Tranby 2007; Emerson, Smith, and Sikkink 1999). Yet, little research has been done on what social factors potentially ameliorate these divisions. Drawing on contact theory, this article examines the potential of interracial contact within multiracial congregations for altering, and ultimately unifying, the attitudes of whites, blacks, and Hispanics regarding black economic disadvantage. Utilizing data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and National Congregations Study (NCS), we find that, relative to those in racially homogenous congregations, whites who frequent multiracial congregations tend to become more structurally-oriented in their explanations for black-white inequality. By contrast, minorities who attend multiracial congregations do not adopt more anti-structural/individualist explanations for inequality. Rather, we find that regardless of race/ethnicity, attendees of multiracial congregations tend to affirm explanations for black-white inequality that are similar to, and in some cases more structurally-oriented than, blacks in racially homogenous congregations. We also demonstrate that these effects are not attributable to selection bias. Based on these findings, we suggest that in order to understand how religion further modifies racial/ethnic differences in racial attitudes, future studies should consider the racial composition of respondents’ religious institutions in order to understand potentially differing effects of diverse spaces where whites are the majority or where racial/ethnic minorities predominate."
0,"This paper traces changes in resilience narratives around hurricane disasters using three cases of catastrophic storms from 1900 to 2005. It argues that narratives of urban or municipal resilience have grown more reflexive as our understanding of natural hazards has grown more sophisticated, but more importantly that what were once primarily narratives around urban resilience have been incorporated into state-based systems of hazard management such that even highly technical expertise comes to depend for its legitimacy, in moments of crisis, on narratives that posit systemic renewal based on civic virtue. As such, they suggest changes in the political culture of risk management, particularly insofar as they suggest new – and less forgiving - understandings of citizenship around risk management. The paper is drawn from a larger study that uses archival data, local and national newspapers, transcripts, and other historical materials to persistence and change in discourse around natural disaster response alongside the development of contemporary disaster management techniques and state-based organizations."
0,"This analysis examines how the spatial concentration of Southern whites is associated with white argument-based lethal violence. Using a well-known measure of spatial segregation (V, the adjusted P* index) among Southern-born whites in US. counties in 2000, the results reveal that the spatial concentration of Southern-born whites is only moderately correlated with their overall representation within counties. This confirms that the quantity of Southerners in an area is not the same thing as their spatial distribution within that same area. Multivariate negative binomial regression models confirm that white argument homicide rates are higher where white Southerners are more spatially concentrated, a link that is confined to Southern counties. The findings illustrate the important role spatial arrangements may play in producing expressive violence among white Southerners."
0,"In the 1970s, health care professionals recommended more medical training and credentialing in addiction.  The fields of addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry answered this appeal.  In 1985, the American Society of Addiction Medicine administered the first national certification examination for physicians who practiced addiction medicine.  Certification in addiction medicine required no formal training in addiction medicine.  Nonetheless, psychiatrists in the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry felt marginalized by certified addiction medicine physicians whom they argued underestimated psychiatry’s central role in drug treatment.  The psychiatrists also acknowledged that they needed better training in addiction and looked to medical fellowship programs to obtain it.  Drawing from historical documents on medical training and credentialing in addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry, supplemented by 10 semi-structured interviews with prominent addiction medicine physicians, addiction psychiatrists, and officials with ties to both medical fields, this paper suggests that occupational groups utilize training programs to achieve professional objectives.  The psychiatrists sought to standardize fellowship training programs in addiction, which the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology privatized and institutionalized, to acquire full control over the medical field of addiction, namely over certified addiction medicine physicians, their primary medical competitors."
0,"The article extends the multi-institutional model of power and change through an analysis of the American Indian Sovereignty Movement. Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of ""contentious"" political action. Instead, to establish tribes' status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians."
0,"A substantial body of literature purports to document the growth of scientific misconduct in Northeast Asia. This article traces the apparent growth of research fraud and falsification to two distinct features of the national innovation systems common to the region: liberal research regimes adopted by developmental states and marked by freedom from government oversight, and illiberal laboratory cultures imported from Germany and marked by all-powerful lab directors and their vulnerable underlings. Based on comparative, qualitative case studies of pioneering countries in bio-medical research, as well as cross-national quantitative analyses of the permissiveness of national stem-cell research policies, we argue that Asia's scientific pathologies are the products of two institutional factors: funding and freedom offered to scientists by developmental states, and the lack of informal control prevalent in the German model of higher education. We conclude that, while Northeast Asian officials offer their biomedical researchers funding and freedom to take advantage of opportunities that rarely exist in the West, their scientists stifle open debate and criticism, and thereby hinder the growth of informal as well as formal control mechanisms that are critical for deterring and detecting scientific fraud."
0,"Do social institutions matter to family life or are they merely adornment to ineluctable social and economic forces? This paper extends recent American research cross-culturally by examining whether the introduction of unilateral no-fault divorce in Australia raised parental divorce risks. We use retrospective reports from the IsssA-Pool database of national surveys, 1984 - 2002 (N=19,601 for this analysis), and estimate the individual-level impact of the change via logistic regression. The key result is that individuals born in cohorts that finished their childhood after divorce law liberalization are about 40 percent more likely to have experienced parental divorce, net of many other social and economic changes. Control variables have their usual effects."
0,"Although research has documented that earnings inequality within organizations affects many dimensions of organizational outcomes, we have little knowledge about what makes some organizations more unequal than others in terms of the earnings distribution. In order to study the relationship between organizational characteristics and within-organization earnings inequality, I analyze a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 manufacturing establishments in the National Employer Survey (NES). This paper focuses on three aspects of organizational characteristics: (1) labor force composition within the organization, (2) use of computer technology at work, and (3) flexible workplace practices such as job rotation and self-managed teams. The analysis suggests that gender heterogeneity, percentage of newly hired workers within the organization, and flexible workplace practices are significantly associated with greater earnings dispersion within establishments. Contrary to the prediction of the skill-biased technological change hypothesis or the deskilling hypothesis, use of computers at work was not significantly associated with earnings inequality within establishments."
0,"This study challenges two well-established associations in medical sociology: the predictive power of self-rated health on mortality and the beneficial effect of marriage on health. Using the National Health Interview Survey 1986-2004 with 1986-2006 mortality follow-up (789,096 respondents with 24,095 deaths) and Cox Proportional Hazards Models, we find that the power of self-rated health to predict mortality is higher for the married than for any unmarried group. By using nonparametric ordered logistic regression models, we find thresholds shift such that, compared to the unmarried, the married may not report poorer health until developing more severe health problems. These findings suggest that, relative to the unmarried, the married tend to overestimate their health status. We also find the protective effect of marriage against mortality decreases with deteriorating health so that the married and unmarried in “poor” health are at similar risk for death. This finding generally holds for objective health measures as well."
0,"Despite a plethora of studies, we do not know why autism incidence has increased so rapidly over the past two decades. Using a longitudinal, population-based dataset from California (953,622 person-years), this study shows that children living in very close proximity to a child previously diagnosed with autism are more likely than children living farther away to subsequently be diagnosed with the disorder.  We rule out competing explanations, i.e., residential sorting, environmental toxins and viral transmission, through a series of seven tests. Our analyses show that information diffusion simultaneously contributed to the increased prevalence of autism, spatial clustering of autism cases, and decreasing age of diagnosis for autism. The social influence mechanism we identify contributes to 16% of the increase in measured prevalence over the period between 2000 and 2005."
0,"Little research has focused on patterns of control and resistance among professionals in contingent employment. One prior study, focusing in part on contract attorneys, found that control was effectively accomplished through professional autonomy and that resistance to work was non-existent. The current research involved interviews of twenty temporary project attorneys as well as participant-observer work as an attorney on seventeen document review projects in the Washington, D.C. area from 2000 through 2004. Contrary to the prior findings involving contract attorneys, this research discovered patterns of control and resistance that did not rely significantly on professional autonomy; rather, the control/resistance dynamic much more closely resembled that found in studies of non-professional temporary workers, including those in the clerical sector. Various reasons for the divergent findings are suggested."
0,"The purpose of this study is to examine the role of economic resources, status compatibility, and alcohol consumption on forms of nonphysical abuse, such as controlling and emotional abuse. Specifically, we focus on the connections between women's employment, the employment of their partners, alcohol use, and women's risk of abuse in intimate relationships. We hypothesize that women in intimate relationships with men will experience more emotional abuse to the extent that they are economically vulnerable. Moreover, abuse should increase if their employment status, in relation to that of their partner, challenges the man's marital power. Moreover, alcohol use by women and/or their partners is also predicted to be associated with emotional abuse. We find some support for assertions that socioeconomic deprivation, as well as challenges to men's masculinity, is associated with emotionally abusive male partners. However, the prevalence and amount of alcohol use by the male partner stands out as the most consistent predictor of emotional abuse in heterosexual relationships."
0,"Scholarly literature and the media often tout ""networking"" as an effective route for obtaining quality employment. Some scholars, however, have cautioned that racially segregated social networks may produce racially segregated workgroups and differential opportunity structures over time. Drawing from theoretical perspectives pertaining to social closure and analyzing data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, this article analyses the role of social contacts and race/ethnic matching in employment. The findings reveal that among individuals using contacts in Job searches, same-race contacts dramatically increase race/ethnic matching for all status groups. On the other hand, using a cross-race contact, while a rare event, strongly discourages this process. The results also show that race/ethnic matching is reduced with increases in educational attainment and in larger workplaces. Further analyses highlighting the quality of Jobs attained through same- and cross-race social contacts show that cross-race contacts do not provide access to higher paying jobs nor jobs with authority They do, however, increase access to lower-level supervisory positions for blacks and Hispanics."
0,"Although research finds high rates of risky sexual and drug related behavior among homeless young people, little research had examined how the characteristics of their social networks encourage or constrain risky behaviors. Based on a sample of 145 homeless young adults in the Midwestern United States, results revealed that having used alcohol with at least one of their network members and the presence of more conflict was associated with engaging in a greater number of sexual risk taking behaviors. Correlates of engaging in a greater number of substance use related behaviors included having older peers within the network, having used illicit drugs with at least one network member, and the presence of more conflict. The presence of a family member in one's network, however, was associated with fewer sexual and drug related risk behaviors. Overall, the social network characteristics of youth explained significant, additional variance beyond that of youth's own characteristics and their early family histories. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Going to college has long been assumed to liberalize students' religious beliefs. Using longitudinal data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, we compare change in the content of religious beliefs of those who do and do not attend college. We find that, in general, college students are no more likely to develop liberal religious beliefs than non-students. In some cases, collegians actually appear more likely to retain their initial beliefs. Change in religious beliefs appears instead to be more strongly associated with network effects. These findings indicate that college's effect on students' religious beliefs is both weak and fragmented, and suggest that the multiplicity of social worlds on college campuses may help to sustain religious beliefs as well as religious practice and commitment."
0,"There are three perspectives, neo-Marxism, post-industrialism and informationalism, have made diverse arguments about the impacts of globalization on class structure and class inequality. In terms of globalization, Hong Kong has been ranked as the freest economy on the earth during the last two decades. I use the data of Hong Kong Census, by-census and survey from 1991 to 2006 to test the hypotheses of the three perspectives. The empirical evidences showed that rather than the expectations of proletarianization (neo-Marxism) and increasing flexible self-employed sector (Informationalism), the impacts of globalization are mainly the facilitation of post-industrial transition and the increase of income inequality between the professionals and unskilled workers in the service sector. Moreover, the findings suggest that the more globalized service sectors such as financial and telecommunication industries did not benefit more, while the unskilled workers in the local service sector did suffer more from Hong Kongs neo-liberal economy."
0,"The term ""undone science"" refers to absences of scientific research that social movement and other civil society organizations find when attempting to make epistemic claims in the political field. The existing literature has identified various pathways for addressing the knowledge needs of civil society organizations, including asking elected and appointed political leaders to shift funding priorities and directly seeking support and partnerships with scientists. Here, a third pathway is identified and explored: civil society organizations that have the resources to fund their own research. A sample of such ""civil society research"" from large, mainstream, U.S. environmental organizations demonstrates that although the large organizations do engage in such research, most of it is not published in peer-reviewed journals. The peer-reviewed research is found almost exclusively in large preservation and conservation organizations that have staffs of scientists. Most of the other research reports are oriented toward documenting environmental problems and providing policy and management solutions. The research is highly applied and does not represent fundamental contributions to large mainstream scientific fields. Comparisons with civil society research in the author's previous research projects on religion, health, and economic development are discussed to assess applicability of the concept for other sociological subfields."
0,"Although income inequality in Central and Eastern Europe was considerably lower during socialism than in other countries at comparable levels of development, it increased significantly in all Central and East European states after the fall of communist regimes. However, some of these countries managed to maintain comparatively low inequality levels 10 years into the transition period while inequalities have skyrocketed in others. What explains this variation? This article presents one of the first longitudinal cross-national analyses of the factors that determine changes in income inequality in 10 Central and East European countries during the first decade after 1989 Results suggest that rising Income inequality is principally related to (1. the expansion idle private sector, (2 retrenchment of the redistributive state, (3. the social exclusion of ethno-national minorities, and (4. penetration of foreign capital. Moreover, the analyses suggest that privatization strategies promoting foreign investment created more inequality than those promoting domestic investment. These findings reveal the social, political and cultural foundations of the income inequality dynamic during post-socialist transition in Central and Eastern Europe"
0,"Adolescent girls are often assumed to be extremely vulnerable to media influences; however, this study argues that girls actually negotiate meaning from media texts. Content analysis of teen prom magazines is combined with ethnography to explore how magazine texts operate within their readers' worlds. This article argues against two commonly accepted dictates. First, I propose that popular magazines for adolescent girls are more complicated than previously acknowledged and do not rely on a singular message of perfection derived from beauty and heterosexual romance. And second, how girls engage with the magazines is more complicated than prior research has argued; girls use ""strategic selectivity"" (a term proposed to explain how girls make meaning of cultural texts) to negotiate the dominant meanings found in prom magazines and other cultural texts."
0,"Social activists and especially insurgents have created solidary cultures of resistance in conditions of high risk and repression. One such instance is an episode of contention by Irish political prisoners in the late 1970s. The ""blanketmen"" appropriated and then built a solidary culture within spaces that had been under official control. Their ability to maintain such a collective response was enhanced by an intensifying cycle of protest and violent reprisal, including extreme stripping of their material environment, in which the prisoners gained considerable initiative. This study uses interviews and contemporary writings by prisoners, prison authorities, visitors, and movement activists to examine how the dynamic of protest and repression transformed insurgent prison culture-through material, emotional, and perceptive changes-and the importance of leadership in the transformation. Special attention is given to prisoner activities in appropriated spaces that reinforced the culture of resistance: promoting the Irish language, cultural production, and the production of propaganda."
0,"On December 8, 2004, the Selendang Ayu, a Malaysian-flagged freighter, ran aground off Unalaska Island in Alaska's Aleutian chain. Despite rescue efforts by the United States Coast Guard, six of the Selendang Ayu's crew members died. In addition to the deaths, more than 300,000 gallons of heavy bulk fuel oil spilled into the sea. Much of the oil washed onto the island's shores, into areas providing cultural, recreational, subsistence, and commercial fishing resources for residents of the renewable resource community of Dutch Harbor/Unalaska. The purpose of this article is to identify and examine different dimensions of risk, based on qualitative research conducted in 2005. We use a contextual constructionist approach to understand risk, which conceptualizes risk as an objective hazard, threat, or danger that is mediated through social and cultural processes. Research methods included 31 personal interviews, participatory observation, and a review of media coverage. Findings revealed several dimensions of risk perceived by residents: the incident in relation to Dutch Harbor/Unalaska as a high-risk community and more general current events; threats to the community's annual $1 billion seafood industry; threats to Alaska Native subsistence culture; and issues of future risk and uncertainty. Interviews and observations support our conclusion that the Selendang Ayu incident represented a ""shot across the bow"" that could have been a ""worst case"" if oil had contaminated commercial fish processing. Residents believe that it is only a matter of time before another, more damaging accident occurs. Given this general perception, it is important to more clearly assess risk in Dutch Harbor/Unalaska and help the community increase resilience to the multiple hazards it faces. More broadly, Dutch Harbor/Unalaska serves as an example-all communities could benefit from better risk assessments and increased attention to resiliency."
0,"This paper explores the dynamics of cross-national cultural diffusion through the study of a particular case in which a symbolically powerful cultural practice, the traditionally English sport of cricket, diffused to most but not all countries with close cultural ties to England.  Diffusion studies rarely consider cases where non-adoption, let alone adoption-then-rejection, are viable alternatives.  They also tend to ignore the role of acculturation and meaning in the decision to adopt or reject specific cultural practices.  To this day, cricket is a cultural practice of intense national interest in other former British Colonies, such as India, Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies; Canadians, on the other hand, show little or no interest in the sport, recent immigrant participation notwithstanding.  National values alone do not account for this variance.  Instead, our explanation of this disparity hinges on two key factors:  first, the degree to which the game was popularized by entrepreneurs looking to get and keep spectators and athletes alike interested in the sport; and second, the degree to which a specific segment of the population was able to dominant the game and thus deter others from even participating.  Both outcomes relate to the nature of the class system in these different societies, as well as the agency of elites and sports entrepreneurs in shaping the cultural valence of the game in their own country.  Elites in Canada turned cricket into a high-prestige cultural practice by creating exclusive cricket clubs and discouraging professionalism in the sport.  A similar process also occurred in the United States, which helps explain why cricket  a once-popular sport in both countries  quickly faded in popularity towards the end of the 19th century.  In the rest of the Commonwealth, on the other hand, colonial elites actually promoted cricket-playing among non-elites as a means of character-building and cultural continuity with the mother land. The theoretical significance of this project is thus the observation that the diffusion of cultural practices can be promoted or discouraged by intermediaries with the power to shape the cultural meaning and institutional accessibility of such practices.  Related examples from the history of baseball, soccer, rugby, and other sports are discussed where applicable."
0,"This paper draws on data from the Monitoring Mt. Laurel Study, a new survey-based study that enables us to compare residents living in an affordable housing project in a middle-class New Jersey suburb to a comparable group of non-residents. Building on the theoretical and empirical contributions of the Gautreaux and Moving to Opportunity studies, we test the hypothesis that living in this housing project improves a poor person's economic prospects relative to what they would have experienced in the absence of such housing, and that these improved prospects can be explained at least in part by reduced exposure to disorder and stressful life events. We find that residents in the Ethel Lawrence Homes are significantly less likely to experience disorder and negative life events and that this improvement in circumstances indirectly improves the likelihood of being employed, their earnings, and the share of income from work. We find no relationship between residence in the housing project and the likelihood of using welfare. "
0,"A scholarly literature on the intersectional realities of race, class, gender, and sexual privilege exists, but professors often struggle with how to teach it, especially given our own (often) privileged positions. Here, the author describes how he uses self-reflexive story-telling as a point of entre to encourage students to think about their own lives within a matrix of privilege and subordination. He shows how stories can illuminate the central role played by ideologies of individual meritocracy in privileged peoples' narratives. The author argues that personal stories are limited unless they also are contextualized within structural analyses that illuminate collective agency. He ends by describing an undergraduate study of USC janitors that reveals how the institution constrains these low-wage workers, while putting into stark relief the relative privilege of students and faculty. He concludes that a pedagogy of privilege should always be grounded in the standpoints of subordinated groups of people."
0,"We examine how religious and political factors structure support for same-sex marriage in the United States over the last two decades Using data from the General Social Surveys we show that respondents who identify more strongly with the Republican Party sectarian denominations, and those who subscribe to biblical fundamentalism and political conservatism are substantially more opposed to same-sex marriage than are other Americans Heterogeneous ordinal logistic regression models show that these religious and political factors have become more important over the last two decades Cohorts born after 1945 became substantially more supportive of marriage rights between 1988 and 2008, but shifts in support for marriage rights were less sizeable for persons affiliated with sectarian denominations religious fundamentalists Republicans and political conservatives Estimates from structural equation models show that religious factors influence political conservatism and Republican identification yet both religious and political factors have significant and substantial Independent direct effects on support for same-sex marriage "
0,"Domestic violence continues to be a serious problem for women in the United States. As a result, the battered women's movement has been Tireless in campaigning for greater awareness of the issue, tougher penalties against offenders, and public vigilance against potential batterers, including fathers from dissolving families. In reaction to this stance, a small but vocal countermovement composed of activists in the fathers' rights movement has argued that the BWM is guilty of what I term enemy boundary creep, a perception whereby these men maintain that they have been inappropriately targeted. Using 40 in-depth interviews with fathers' rights activists located across the country, this article details the narrative that these men have composed as to why the BWM is expanding the scope of its enemies, the tactics that the BWM is using in this campaign, and the insidious effects that these efforts are having on fathers across the Country. This narrative formulates a boundary-push back response. This analysis thus articulates how an Unlikely countermovement can use the accusation of enemy boundary creep by its social movement opponents in an effort to shift the political discourse on a significant public problem."
0,"Emotions clearly matter in social movements, but it is less apparent how social movement participants actively handle emotions in their line of activities. In this article, the authors address this question by examining how two reproductive rights coalitions in Peru employ and manage emotions in relation to different actors who they must deal with to influence policies. Empirical materials consist of participant observation, focus groups, and individual interviews conducted with the coalitions and their members. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data. The authors distinguish relationships with five relevant actors: the internal members of the coalitions, allies, the general public, the Catholic Church as the major opponent, and government officials as the main target. As each relationship requires distinct emotion work, coalition members simultaneously adjust to contradictory emotional expectations while actively evoking and coordinating emotions. The authors refer to this as the orchestration of emotion work."
0,"In an effort to understand the relationship between culture and social change, this exploration of the case of Gandhian nonviolence provides insights into the paradoxes of cultural innovation. It examines Gandhis dialectical approach to struggle, addressing the apparent contradiction between the warrior and pacifist motifs that run through the worlds faith traditions. Gandhis nonviolent activist fights like the warrior but avoids harming like the pacifist, a cultural innovation that grew out of the conflicts in Gandhis own experience between spirituality and politics, colonial domination and British law, tradition and modernity, and so forth. In the end, the Gandhian case demonstrates that cultural innovation  and the very autonomy of culture  occurs not simply in spite of, but also because of the limitations on agency created by structure."

0,"Drawing on recent advances in community-ecological research, emerging scholarship within family sociology on the importance of men, and current research on gender stratification, this article lays out a theoretical framework and offers evidence of the importance of two forms of male capital, men in families and old heads, for lessening female and male violence rates across communities. Using arrest and ecological data from more than 1,600 counties and seemingly unrelated regression techniques, the author finds that the presence of men in families is integral to community efforts to reduce both female and male violence levels, net controls for ecological variables; old heads are moderately effective in reducing male violence levels. Men in families have robust effects on both female and male violence rates, though male homicide is somewhat more responsive to shifts in the presence of men in families and old heads. Gender differences across other ecological variables are minimal."
0,"Sociologists have long sought to understand the relationship between collective experiences and individual commitments. This article examines the short-term mission as an institutionalized religious experience, assessing its prevalence, predictors and impact on the religions trajectories of the youth who participate in them. Religiously devout adolescents are more likely than others to go on a short-term mission as are younger adolescents and those with very religious parents. Applying propensity score matching to a nationally representative longitudinal sample of American adolescents, we find that adolescents who go on a short-term mission between interview waves report increased religious participation and solidified religious beliefs. We use the example of this experience to emphasize the importance of considering religious experiences to develop more nuanced understandings of the way religion shapes the beliefs and behaviors of individuals."

This article builds on earlier theories of workplace deviance, demonstrating how deviance can serve different purposes and expanding the concept of ""deviance admiration"" (Heckert and Heckert 2004). It examines deviance in a circumstance-the taxicab industry-which introduces a tension between mandated conformity and necessary deviance: employees must conform to the employers' rules and yet, to accomplish their jobs well, they need to abandon those rules occasionally. In addition to its theoretical contributions, this work has important practical applications for managers."
0,"In this essay, I argue that Alvin Gouldners critique of functionalism, although valuable, is not his major theoretical contribution.  Rather, it is a portion of his larger, postmarxian theoretical project.  Gouldners project not only questioned functional theory during its height as the dominant paradigm, it also brought conflict back into a conservative model and extended beyond Marxism in notable ways.  The focus on Gouldners critique of Parsons renders invisible his other contributions, i.e. his differentiation of the two Marxisms, the theory of the New Class, and his notion of reflexive sociology.  In this paper, I look at four different aspects of Gouldner's work to illustrate his larger contribution to Marxist and critical theory studies."
0,"This paper presents findings from a global study I have led at the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion & Public Life. The study finds that about 70% of the world’s population live in countries where governments imposed high restrictions on religion and belief or where there were high levels of religious hostilities in society. Additionally, the study finds that about a third of the world’s population live in countries where restrictions or hostilities are increasing. There are several intriguing patterns. First, substantial increases occurred in countries where restrictions and hostilities were already high, but decreases tended to be in countries where they were already low. Also, rising restrictions were associated with contradictory constitutional protections for religious freedom as well as the presence of anti-blasphemy laws. Next, Christians and Muslims, the world’s two largest religious groups, were harassed in the largest number of countries. However, while Jews comprise less than 1% of the world’s population, they were harassed in 75 countries (38%).  The Middle East and North Africa saw the largest increases in government restrictions, but Europe had the largest proportion of countries in which social hostilities related to religion rose. Finally, government restrictions in Egypt were increasing well before the ongoing revolutions known as Arab Spring.  Given such trends, it’s unarguable that changes in religious restrictions are a PART of the larger social and political forces shaping the world today."
0,"Ethnic residential concentration is often found to hamper immigrants' majority language proficiency. However, there are still several gaps in our understanding of the relationship between ethnic concentration and ethnic minorities' language practices. This study examines the extent to which ethnic concentration also constrains immigrants' majority language use, whether contact with natives and co-ethnics mediates these relationships, and whether ethnic concentration relates to second-generation minorities' minority language proficiency. Structural equation models on data for people of Turkish and Moroccan origin living in the Netherlands (N = 2163) showed that ethnic concentration is indirectly related to weaker majority language proficiency and less majority language use through contact with natives and co-ethnics. For second-generation minorities, ethnic concentration is related to better minority language proficiency. "
0,"Many sociologists have endorsed group or collaborative learning strategies for teaching college level methods and statistics courses, but few researchers provide empirical evidence that students quantitative skills actually increase as a result of the collaborative experience.  Assessment of the effectiveness of collaborative teaching techniques is frequently subjectively based and often relies on casual comments from students or faculty.  Despite this shortcoming, sociologists searching for new and effective ways of teaching quantitative courses continue to experiment with collaborative pedagogy.  Consequently, an exploration of the efficacy of group or collaborative teaching modalities on student learning of social statistics warrants attention.  This study examines the relationship between collaborative assignments and students statistical skills and knowledge.  Data were derived from 233 students enrolled in eight sections of a social statistics course taught between 1996 and 2003.  The results both challenge and support the efficacy of collaborative learning and suggest that faculty modify such techniques when evidence of student learning cannot be empirically linked to the collaborative experience."
0,"Ethnic-based policies-both discriminatory and remedial-are in place in many countries throughout the world today, sometimes enacted with the intent of improving interethnic relations. But evidence on how these policies affect interethnic relations is sparse and inconclusive. In this study, I empirically examine how discriminatory and remedial policies impact the likelihood groups will be engaged in interethnic violence using data on over 130 groups from more than 75 countries. Performing the analyses at the group level, using disadvantaged minority groups as my units of analyses, I find that discrimination has a positive effect on the likelihood the groups will be engaged in interethnic violence, while remediation has a negative effect, controlling for important group- and country-level factors. I discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how government-mandated policies influence peace and conflict."

I find that young people who have a visual, hearing, speech or ""other"" impairment are more likely than their nondisabled peers to find themselves among the respondents who did not complete any of the adult transitions examined in the analysis. Young people who have a learning disability are also more likely to be in a ""just workers"" group (i.e., respondents who are still living at home, for the most part, but working fulltime)."

What of the effects of the intersections of officer race and ethnicity and driver race and ethnicity, such as a white police officer and an African-American driver?  The present research uses citizen self-reports of traffic tickets to answer these questions.  Net of additional explanatory measures including the legal reason for the traffic stop and other extralegal driver characteristics such as social class and age, the citizen self-report data indicate that driver gender, officer race and ethnicity, driver race and ethnicity, and intersections of officer race and ethnicity with driver race and ethnicity all affect traffic tickets by police."
0,"The literature on assimilation and ethnic identity formation largely assumes that the durability of ethnic boundaries is a function of the assimilation measures that sociologists commonly employ. But this literature fails to account adequately for the role of immigration patterns in explaining the durability and nature of ethnic boundaries. Using 123 in-depth interviews with later-generation Mexican Americans, this article shows that Mexican immigrant replenishment shapes ethnic boundaries and ethnic identity formation. The sizable immigrant population sharpens intergroup boundaries through the indirect effects of nativism and by contributing to the continuing significance of race in the lives of later-generation Mexican Americans. The presence of a large immigrant population also creates intragroup boundaries that run through the Mexican-origin population and that are animated by expectations about ethnic authenticity. The article illustrates the importance of immigrant replenishment to processes of assimilation and ethnic identity formation."
0,"This study examines how high school boys' and girls' academic effort, in the form of math coursetaking, is influenced by members of their social contexts. The authors argue that adolescents' social contexts are defined, in part, by clusters of students ( termed ""local positions"") who take courses that differentiate them from others. Using course transcript data from the recent Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study, the authors employ a new network algorithm to identify local positions in 78 high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Incorporating the local positions into multilevel models of math coursetaking, the authors find that girls are highly responsive to the social norms in their local positions, which contributes to homogeneity within and heterogeneity between local positions."
0,"Racial composition and unemployment have appeared as either theoretically-relevant controls or variables of substantive interest in numerous Studies of crime. While there is no clear consensus in the literature as to their statistical significance, the lack of consensus has been most apparent in panel analyses with unit fixed effects. One explanation for this is that racial composition and unemployment are fairly invariant, or slow-moving, which leads to collinearity with unit dummies. A number of pertinent studies are reviewed to illustrate how two slow-moving variables, percent black and percent unemployed, have behaved inconsistently. A fixed effects vector decomposition procedure [Plumper, V., Troeger, V. E., 2007. Efficient estimation of time-invariant and rarely changing variables in finite sample panel analyses with unit fixed effects. Political Analysis, 15, 124-139.] is used to illustrate how these variables' coefficients appear positive and significant when the slow-moving process is acounted for. "

Findings suggest little changes in work morale of white-collar workersmore MPT workers in the 2002 data strongly agreed that they ofeel proud to be working for their employerso than did their counterparts in 1991, but fewer of them agreed to the statement. Moreover, managerial employees have been increasingly akin to the tall organizational hierarchy, but display some resentment toward teamwork. In contrast, work morale of professional/technical workers is not related to the changes in organizational hierarchy and teamwork, but their positive reaction to internal labor markets has significantly declined from 1991 to 2002. The conclusion section summarizes major findings and discusses implications for future studies on this subject."
0,"World-system scholars have traditionally emphasized the stability of the core/periphery hierarchy. However, prior network studies employing both categorical and continuous measures of world-system position reveal substantial mobility across time, whereby a number of developing states have become more integrated in the world economy over the past several decades. The developmental impact generated by such mobility remains unexplored. Using data on all commodities in the world trade network, I examine the presence and economic impact of world-system mobility across 110 states during the 1980-2000 period. First, I show that the continued upward mobility of ""middle-tier"" states from East Asia and the semiperiphery no longer contributes to the long-term trend of trade convergence, but began producing divergence during the final decades of the 20(th) century. Second, using difference models that control for lagged values, I find that world-system mobility positively affects economic growth, net of initial world-system position, capital and labor inputs, and other regional and economic characteristics. In fact, the magnitude of mobility's effect is substantially larger than that of initial world-system position and second only to initial human capital. These findings support a range of perspectives that are collectively useful for understanding the rapid economic growth of emerging states."
0,"We apply Durkheim's social transitional theory to explain the variation of anomie in 30 nations in the world. Combining data from two sources the 1995 World Values Survey and the United Nations University's World Income Inequality Database or WIID - we test the hypothesis that rapid sociopolitical change at the structural level disrupts social integration and regulation, and increases the level of anomie among individuals in a society. Using the multilevel approach that permits the decomposition of variance within and between nations, the results of the analyses confirm that rapid sociopolitical change at the macro level, such as the political transition from totalitarianism to democracy, produces a higher level of anomie among individuals in a society. In addition, we find a cross-level effect of confidence in authority on anomie. Findings at the individual level are largely consistent with Merton's theory of anomie and with the extant literature that anomie is inversely related to an individual's social and economic position in a society."
0,"Prior research in the area of organizational commitment (OC) of workers has indicated that there are two primary factors that affect workers' commitment to the hiring organization - job satisfaction (JS) and perceived organizational support (POS).  To see if this was true for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) employed by their local school districts, a regional survey of 700 SLPs employed in seven Midwestern states was conducted to examine the relationship between organizational commitment and the independent variables job satisfaction and perceived organizational support utilizing the Organizational Commitment Scale for School SLPs questionnaire.  A total of 533  surveys were returned (response rate of 76.1 percent-) for analysis.  This paper reports on the nature of the relationships (correlations) that were obtained in this study and examines these findings in relation to previous investigations in the study of organizational commitment with workers in other occupations/professions and in other work settings."
0,"From 2000 through 2008, initiatives proposing to ban same-sex marriage were on the ballot in 28 states. Although same-sex marriage opponents scored lopsided victories in most cases, voting outcomes varied substantially at the county level. This article examines sources of that variation and argues that opposition to same-sex marriage should be strong in communities characterized by the predominance of traditional gender roles and family structure. Perhaps more interestingly the analysis also shows that the effects of traditional family structure and gender roles are especially strong in counties characterized by weak community cohesion, as indicated by residential instability, low rates of home ownership, and high crime rates."
0,"Using couples' time-diary data from two French time-use surveys ( 1986, 1999), this article explores the extent to which off-scheduling within dual-earner couples is an unequal and negative externality for family time. An empirical typology of family workdays is built using a variant of optimal matching, and three kinds of family time are taken into account: conjugal time, father- and mother-child time, and parents-child time. The results indicate that off-scheduling is an unintentional by-product of employers' economic interests and that, since it reduces conjugal and parents-child time but fails to foster temporal complementarity between parents, it is a negative factor for family solidarity."
0,"Academic careers have traditionally been conceptualized as pipelines, through which young scholars move seamlessly from graduate school to tenure-track positions. This model often fails to capture the experiences of female Ph.D. recipients, who become tenure-track assistant professors at lower rates than do their male counterparts. What do these women do instead? We use panel data from the 1983-1995 Surveys of Doctorate Recipients to explore the early careers of Ph.D. recipients. Our results show that female doctorate recipients are disproportionately likely to be employed as adjunct faculty or exit the paid labor force, especially if they have young children. Contrary to conventional wisdom, adjunct professorships provide a better opportunity forgetting a tenure-track job down the road than do non-teaching positions inside or outside of academia. Collectively these findings show that the academic life course is both complex and permeable."
0,"By applying a social movement perspective to collaborative innovation, I examine how a project team mobilizes resources from diverse stakeholders.  Analysis of an innovation project at NASA offers insights into how a project team influences stakeholders in the face of divergent and shifting criteria.  I find that the project team mobilized stakeholders’ resources, such as Congressional funding and academic endorsement, after developing three mechanisms for collective action:  constructing a clear project identity, adopting flexible roles, and performing institutional groundwork that changed the arrangements through which resources were distributed."
0,"In this paper, I explore the attitudes of 52 Chileans toward globalization and neoliberalism and their impact on their nation and the lives of Chilean women.  By examining national policies, quantitative measures of development, and how various women in the labor force and political and community organizations perceive and live within the Chilean economy, I show the dynamic relationship between national and international policies and gender inequality and women’s empowerment.   I discuss how women have gained or lost in neoliberal Chile through wage labor and how that has impacted their relationships within the home and within their communities.   I also focus on changing cultural constructions within Chilean society and on major social inequalities that negatively impacted women’s power both inside and outside the home.    Although working full time, most of my respondents also were committed to full-time activism to promote equality and provide a backlash against neoliberal economic policies."
0,"Previous studies find that workers of longer work weeks report more market hours in stylized measure than in time diary, while those of shorter work weeks report fewer hours. Using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) 2003-2007, this paper attempts to explain this dilemma. I argue that market work time is composed of activity time, committed time, and constrained time. Thus, part of the difference found between the two estimates is due to the calculation of the diary estimate. I also argue that the wording of the stylized question is consequential. Some stylized questions (e.g., How many hours per week do you usually work?) might capture the mode, instead of the mean, of work time. Thus, when the distribution of work time is skewed, the mismatch between the two estimates is expected. A sequence-based identification for diary estimate and a non-parametric adjustment for stylized estimate are proposed and empirically examined. The result indicates that both methods significantly reduce the observed gap between the two estimates. I discuss the implications for future time use survey design in the concluding section. "
0,"The educational disadvantage of children born to teenage mothers has been well-established, but relatively little is known about how this disadvantage takes root and grows in the preschool years.  Using recent nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, we investigated the relationship between having a teenage mother or father and childrens preschool cognitive, behavioral, and health outcomes.  We found that having either a teenage mom or dad was associated with childrens compromised development across several domains, but the negative effects of having a teenage father disappeared once paternal coresidence and maternal age were controlled.  We also found strong evidence that social disadvantage before and after the childs birth accounted for most of the relationship between teen childbearing and child outcomes. Biological and developmental explanations, which assume that maternal age rather than social disadvantage affects child outcomes, received some support, but less than disadvantage-based explanations did.  Material resources in the childs household partially or fully mediated each of the relationships between teenage childbearing and child outcomes, suggesting that social policies could intervene successfully to close the developmental gap between teenage mothers and older mothers children before they enter school."
0,"Claims have been made stating that the quality of reporting has begun to dwindle due to cutbacks suffered by newspapers. Because of the immediate significance that epidemic reporting has on the population, a decline in the quality of reporting could be detrimental to the society’s ability to effectively cope with the epidemic. This study will be the first attempt to study the effect of cutbacks on the quality of news reporting by using object data.  This study analyzes 135 randomly selected newspaper articles regarding epidemics through content analysis. These articles hail from three different U.S. national newspapers (The Wall Street Journal; The New York Times; The Los Angeles Times) that had suffered different degrees of cutbacks over three different outbreaks in U.S. history (AIDS between 1981-1984; West Nile virus between 1999-2002; H1N1 in 2009).  Content analysis of randomly selected articles finds a general decline in the quality of epidemic reporting over the past three decades.  However, the effect of the newspaper's cutbacks on the quality of its epidemic news reporting is not straightforward.  In general, the newspaper that suffered a great degree of cutback has also suffered a greater decline in its quality of epidemic news reporting.  The implications of the findings are discussed."
0,"The ojobs versus the environmento dichotomy has been a recurring theme in the United States for decades. It is typically taken to refer to a choice or trade-off between economic growth and development and environmental quality or the lack of environmental degradation. Little resolution has occurred after decades of research because of inconsistent or problematic conceptualization and the use of inappropriate spatial units of analysis. Research on international and domestic pollution havens is reviewed in an effort to introduce the Local Pollution Havens concept. Local pollution havens are conceptualized as counties with high levels of pollution per unit of economic reward, high toxicity per unit of economic reward, and low regulation or other social controls. Traditional and spatial statistical techniques are utilized to construct this measure and determine which counties fit the conceptualization. Descriptive statistics and the results of t-tests and logistic regression analyses are presented to demonstrate how these areas differ from other counties. Implications for the remediation of these areas and also avenues of future research are offered."
0,"The Washington State Achiever (WSA) program was a large-scale educational intervention of scholarships, mentoring, and school redesign designed to encourage students from moderate and low income families to attend college in Washington State. Using a quasi-experimental design based on pre- and post-intervention surveys of high school seniors in program and non-program schools, we find a significant WSA effect on educational outcomes, net of the demographic and socioeconomic composition of students across schools. Across the three intervention high schools, the program is strongly significant in one school, significant after a lag in another school, and not significant in a third. We speculate about the potential reasons for the differential program effect across high schools. "
0,"How does the combined working time of dual-earner couples affect the work-family conflict of men and women in these relationships?  Does this effect vary by family life stage?  This study draws on data from the 1997 National Study of the Changing Workforce to answer these questions.  I find that work-family conflict increases among men and women as the couples joint hours of paid labor rises.  Furthermore, women, but not men, are affected by the ratio of their own employment hours to those of their husbands.  Finally, parents report significantly higher levels of work-family conflict than do non-parents; I find some evidence that this effect varies by the age of the youngest child in the home.  Future research using couples as the unit of analysis and longitudinally examining families over the life course is suggested."
0,"We test three models (Allen 1978) that imply, respectively, that African Americans (1) have a mental health advantage because they maintain stronger systems of social support than Whites; (2) have poorer mental health than Whites because they have smaller, less effective support systems; or (3) do not differ from Whites on mental health when socioeconomic status is controlled. We use data from the National Comorbidity Survey (Kessler et al. 1994) to address four questions: Does the structure of social relationships, as well as perceived supportiveness and strain from them, vary by race and gender? How does psychological functioning--psychological distress, mental disorder, and substance disorder--differ by race and gender? How do social relationships influence psychological functioning? Do social relationships influence the psychological functioning of African American and White men and women in different ways? The findings clearly contradict models (2) and (3), but do not strongly support model (1). With SES controlled, African Americans are advantaged on all three measures of psychological functioning, and the differences are not explained by differences in social integration and relationship quality. Conceptualizing and measuring the processes that are responsible for higher psychological functioning among African Americans is an important task for future research."
0,"This paper is part of a larger exploratory project on the  personal and professional lives of women rabbis, specifically  the stresses they experience at home as a result of her work and how they resolve them.  Since the women had chosen an unconventional career path,  I was also interested in how the couples handle gender issues.  Data is based on responses of 89 women rabbis to closed ended and open ended questions, responded to on line. Many of the women had been in established relationships when they entered the seminary and most felt their partners/husbands very supportive.  The biggest problems mentioned are increased visibility and absences from their families on weekends and holidays  because she is conducting services and weekday evenings because of meetings.  They tend to change traditional religious rituals performed in the home such as lighting candles to welcome the Sabbath, traditionally done by the woman.   My sample is almost equally divided between the woman /rabbi doing this and the couple doing it together.  At the same time the women have more responsibility than their (male) partners to get the children and home ready for the Sabbath."
0,"In this paper we examine the changing character of organizations operating in the field of poverty relief in New York City between 1888-1917.  Using data from the New York City Charity Directories, we focus in particular on the process by which organizations strive to develop innovative strategies for positioning themselves within the institutional field.  We show that a number of organizational factors tended to be associated with the creation of successful categorical innovations:  the availability of public funding, the recency of organizational founding, deviance from organizational norms, and location within a highly contested (“crowded”) region of organizational space.   We also examine the kinds of innovations that proved to be successful.  We show that successful innovations tend to be incremental rather radical in design, that organizational technology often drives innovation, and that the construction of new social problems is a frequent innovation strategy among social welfare organizations.  In the process we argue that a better theory of organizational categories would enable us to more fully understand how and why some kinds of institutionalized categories come to be combined with other categories, and, in the process, are meaningfully defined by those relations.  In other words, we are interested in developing a theory of the combinatorial affinities of categories as they operate within institutional systems."
0,"We examine racial variation in wage penalties associated with incarceration by comparing the earnings trajectories of African American, Latino, and white male ex-offenders with non-offenders. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979-2002), our findings reveal that while incarceration generally has a negative effect on wages, the impact of incarceration on wages is the most severe for African American men.  When compared to white non-offenders, white ex-offenders experience the highest wage penalties due to incarceration of any group, yet they still out earn all African American and Latino men. Meanwhile, the wage difference between African American non-offenders and ex-offenders across their careers is smaller than any white or Latino men and African American men earn significantly less than all others, regardless of their former incarceration status.  Explanations for these patterns include racial differences in pre-incarceration wages and the dramatic racial disparities in imprisonment rates that render more African American men subject to earnings penalties associated with former incarceration status.  We contend that because racialized incarceration stigmas challenge the labor market options and economic trajectories of all African American men, young, low-wage African American men who have no history of incarceration are also penalized."
0,"Although anti-immigrant attitudes represent a widespread social problem in many European societies, research has only partially understood the role the demographic size of the immigrant population plays for the prevalence of such attitudes. In this study, we use group threat- and intergroup contact theory to derive competing hypotheses on the role the size of the immigrant population plays for explaining the anti-immigrant attitudes of Dutch citizens. To this end, we used structural equation modeling with robust standard errors on nationally representative individual-level survey data enriched with official municipality-level statistics. We found empirical evidence for both group threat- and intergroup contact theory. Objective measurements of immigrant group size corresponded with subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size. Conversely, subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size were associated with perceptions of threatened group interests, which in turn related to anti-immigrant attitudes. On the other hand, however, larger immigrant group size facilitates intergroup contact, which was negatively associated with perceived threat and subsequent anti-immigrant attitudes. "
0,"Numerous studies have noted the increasing levels of inequality in American society but relatively few have linked this inequality to the dynamics of the global economy In this study we examine the impact of five measures of globalization (global capital, foreign direct investment exports, foreign born non-citizens and foreign born citizens) and six measures of labor market transformation (deindustrialization, corporate restructuring bureaucratic burden casualization, bad jobs and multiple job holding) on metropolitan-level earnings inequality of full-time full-year workers 16 years and older Our study makes several major contributions to the literature First we update and extend the long line of studies on metropolitan earnings inequality Second we show that these various dimensions of globalization and labor market transformation exert independent and mainly polarizing effects on the earnings distributions of metropolitan areas net of controls for labor market structure and sociodemographic variables Third we demonstrate the benefits of looking at the causes of inequality in the upper and lower tails of the earnings distribution Finally we develop a procedure to estimate counterfactual values of earnings inequality for all major metropolitan areas in the US in 2000 In the process, the paper provides a comprehensive accounting of the impact of globalization and labor market transformation on metropolitan earnings inequality "
0,"This paper investigates the extent to which particular communities determine place-based solutions to conservation challenges that are anything but local.  While resource management literatures focus on balancing the interests of states against those of local communities, this study focuses on how sensitivity to local concern is negotiated in situ by intermediary agencies and organizations attempting federal policy implementation at the local level.  Stakeholders in two community-based conservation partnerships in the U.S. were interviewed on the parameters of their concern with interconnecting ecological and social communities. Acceptance of participation of ""outside"" players in implementing national policy varies at two sites dealing with complex multi-scale environmental issues.  Partnerships in each site often negotiate based on the perceived commitment or openness of organizations, regardless of interest or location within the communities in question.  Exploring how outside facilitators become legitimated as local stakeholders suggests how moral economies of place, region, and state inscribe and inform putatively transparent ""local"" decision-making."
0,"Seoul in South Korea has risen remarkably in the global hierarchy of cities since the mid-1970s, and it is arguably now among an elite group of about 15 of the most globally central cities in the world. While it is increasingly the object of urban studies research, few efforts have specifically focused on linking social structural changes within the city to its increasingly intense participation  in the global economy.  The globalization and world cities perspective suggests that as cities achieve global prominence, they should experience certain social structural transformations, some of which are problemetic, such as increasing marginalization and polarization.  But critics of this view argue that the ""globalizationists"" ignore the role of the state, which to them, has a more profound  influence over urban transformations.  This paper surveys some of the research and data on Seoul's recent social transformation and compares these changes to the expectations of the globalization perspective and to the counter-argument that state policies are more important.  We also discuss the likelihood that the Korean capital will improve or even maintain its prominence in the world-system's city system."
0,"Literature on aggression often suggests that individual deficiencies, such as social incompetence, psychological difficulties, or troublesome home environments, are responsible for aggressive behavior. In this article, by contrast, we examine aggression from a social network perspective, arguing that social network centrality, our primary measure of peer status, increases the capacity for aggression and that competition to gain or maintain status motivates its use. We test these arguments using a unique longitudinal dataset that enables separate consideration of same- and cross-gender aggression. We find that aggression is generally not a maladjusted reaction typical of the socially marginal; instead, aggression is intrinsic to status and escalates with increases in peer status until the pinnacle of the social hierarchy is attained. Over time, individuals at the very bottom and those at the very top of a hierarchy become the least aggressive youth. We also find that aggression is influenced not so much by individual gender differences as by relationships with the other gender and patterns of gender segregation at school. When cross-gender interactions are plentiful, aggression is diminished. Yet these factors are also jointly implicated in peer status: in schools where cross-gender interactions are rare, cross-gender friendships create status distinctions that magnify the consequences of network centrality."
0,"Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC). Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor, unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of 176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First, findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and economic inequality as much as prison siting results from concentrated rural disadvantage. Second, there is not one prototypical prison town. Instead, there are typologies of prison towns based on US region, race, town population size, race, prior proximate prison, and SES. Lastly, future studies should consider the theoretical and methodological implications of rural concentrated disadvantage in measuring prison impact. "
0,"This study examines how rurality and gender are related to online health activities. Rural women face greater health risks and yet have access to a weaker health system infrastructure, which has resulted in a health disadvantage.  New health information technologies may ameliorate some of these disparities; thus, we examine the relevance of gender and place in going online to search for health information, buy medicines, participate in a health support group, communicate with a physician, or maintain a personal health record.  Analyzing data from the National Cancer Institute’s 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), we find that the relationships between rurality and gender vary depending upon the specific type of online health activity, and that gender may be a more salient factor than rurality in determining whether individuals engage in particular types of online health activities. Also, this research highlights the importance of expanding high speed access to rural locations."
0,"Despite the high incidence of abortion in the US, many women who have abortions experience stigma.  Previous research has explored determinants of abortion, its psychological implications, and women’s decision-making and feelings surrounding abortion, the construction and management of abortion stigma is largely unexplored. This paper offers a critical feminist analysis of abortion stigma. I interviewed 41 women who had chosen to have an abortion one day to several weeks prior to their procedure. By talking with women before their procedure, I was able to gather information about how women experience and manage abortion stigma.  Abortion contradicts reified gender norms that define women’s sexual and social roles, which in turn define their individual identities. I apply the concept that gender, race/ethnicity and class are simultaneously performed identities and that these performances are read through the lens of gender. Women use three strategies to manage stigma: in the first strategy, they frame their decision as in alignment with appropriate gender performance and enact complicit femininities; in the second strategy, they identify themselves as performing gender inappropriately and as therefore incapable of mothering and accept the identities of pariah femininities; and in the last strategy, they offer alternative constructions of gender in which an abortion is considered an acceptable choice and construct alternative femininities. Women’s manipulation of these gender, racial/ethnic, and class performances allow women to manage stigma and exercise agency. The performance of complicit and pariah femininities bolster hegemonic gender ideologies and practices and alternative femininities challenge the legitimacy of these ideologies."
0,"International research shows that both work-family conflict and time pressure are increasing in Western societies. With these increased pressures, precisely those people who are combining work and family obligations may be missing from survey estimates. This study investigates whether the measurement of work-family conflict (WFC) and time pressure is influenced by nonresponse bias. Using the Flemish ""Work, Family and Time use in Flanders""-survey and the Basic Question survey for nonrespondents of this survey, we investigate whether nonrespondents score higher on subjective and objective indicators of WFC and time pressure than respondents. Results show that nonrespondents are indeed those sample units who experience significantly more WFC and time pressure, demonstrating that WFC and time pressure related nonresponse biases exist. Implications and suggestions to reduce bias in data collections are discussed. "
0,"Occupations have long been regarded as central to the stratification systems of industrial countries such as the United States.   Thus, they shouldbut unfortunately have notfigure centrally in attempts to explain the well-documented increases in wage inequality in the1980s and 1990s.  This paper uses data from the Current Population Surveys from 1983 to 2002 to build upon recent work by Kim and Sakamoto (2006), who showed that most of the inequality in wages lies within- rather than between-occupations.  We test a number of hypotheses about ways in which occupations might be related to the growth in wage inequality: between-occupation differences in skills and mechanisms of social closure; and within-occupation differences in organizational and industrial characteristics."
0,"This project specifically examines Americans valorization and civic acceptance of Asian Americans relative to Blacks and Whites. Using data of selected years from the General Social Surveys (1990, 1994, 2000, and 2002) and the American National Election Studies (1992, 2000, 2000, and 2004), my analyses indicate that Asian Americans are racially triangulated vis-à-vis Black and Whites, and there exists a gap between valorization and civic acceptance for them. this study is among the first few efforts empirically testing the racial triangulation of Asian Americans thesis (Kim 1999; Bonilla-Silva 2004); that is, Asian Americans are ranked in the middle of the racial hierarchy with regard to some commonly discussed racial traits (e.g., intelligence and work ethics), but they are usually rated relatively low on the scale of civic acceptance (e.g., patriotism and feeling close to). My findings, however, indicate that, Asians receive an average of high, if not highest in every account, ratings among three races (Asian, Blacks, and Whites) with regard to major racial traits/socioeconomic characteristics. However, they are still considered to be least patriotic and desirable to live with in the same community, and most distanced from. This study also points to race, some socio-demographic factors (especially age, education, and size of residing city) as well as political cleavages as important predictors of such racial triangulation of Asian Americans."
0,"Using the latest 1998-2000 GSS data, this study examines what kinds of parents tend to select nonpublic schools for their children. The results of logistic regression analysis show that parents who are Christian, who are older, who have higher socioeconomic status, and who live in the Northeast and Midwest are more likely than their respective counterparts to send their children to religious schools against public schools.  However, there are no significant racial, gender, or urban/rural differences in parental choice of religious schools.  Parental socioeconomic status is the key factor in determining their choice of nonreligious private schools. Other factors do not make significant differences in the selection of private schools. Currently, no significant differences in demographic, religious, socioeconomic, and family structure characteristics can be detected with regard to which parents are more likely to home school their children."
0,"The purpose to this study is to investigate the effect of cultural and social capital on high school academic performance and college enrollment decisions of low-income and first-generation college students. The study was a longitudinal, repeated measures design from secondary data from the national evaluation of Upward Bound program. The sample was comprised of 2,797 respondents, the Upward Bound treatment group (n=1,524) and the control group (n=1,273).  The results showed that social capital in the form of parental discussion and involvement had a positive effect on high school graduation, college enrollment, and four-year college enrollment. Students who participated in cultural activities in Upward Bound were more likely to attend college and enroll in a 4-year college than their peers who did not participate. Future research should focus on the role of parental involvement in pre-college programs."
0,"This study builds on recent research linking adult sports to cultural capital and argues that integrating sports into analyses of cultural exclusion will help us better understand recent changes in the structure of cultural capital. Research on the “sports as cultural capital” thesis is summarized and data from the Survey for Public Participation in the Arts is used to test and elaborate this line. Patterns of adult sport participation fit Bourdieu’s mapping of cultural boundaries in advanced capitalist societies which highlights gendered divisions in the volume and structure of capital.  We then identify which forms of high status culture (residual, emergent, hegemonic) are associated with three types of sporting practice controlling for a wide range of social class and other social structural variables. Tests go beyond demonstrating general links between sports and traditional high culture to show where different types of sport fit within both the “social space” and different realms of high culture. The findings support an argument that sports have played a more important and different role than previously recognized in the transformation of high status culture and lifestyles in the last half of the 20th century and sketch some ideas of how this transformation might be viewed differently if sports were better integrated into analyses. This leads us beyond omnivore/univore and highbrow/lowbrow distinctions. The patterns uncovered are linked to a spurt in “cultures of self-rationalization” that has greater affinity with “concerted cultivation,” “emotional capital,” and a “logic of constant competition” (Lareau 2003, Illouz 2008, Bourdieu 1996a)"
0,"The growth of the undocumented population and immigrants geographic dispersion into new destinations throughout the country have changed the face of contemporary American immigration. Yet surprisingly little is actually known about the ways in which immigrants, particularly undocumented ones, are being incorporated into versus excluded from American society.  In this paper, I examine to what extent Hispanic newcomers, especially undocumented ones, are being incorporated into several sets of social and legal institutions in two new rural Southern immigrant destinations in eastern North Carolina:  public elementary and higher educational institutions, social and medical services institutions, law enforcement agencies, and court systems.  Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and 129 indepth interviews with Latin American immigrants, U.S.-born Hispanics/Latinos, and white and black key native informants in eastern North Carolina, I argue that Hispanic newcomers are undergoing a process of bureaucratic incorporation rather than civic and political incorporation as it has been traditionally conceptualized by political incorporation theories.  I highlight the dual roles played by (1) state policies and (2) professional norms and missions among bureaucrats working in these institutions in this process.  My results document variation organized primarily by state policies and secondarily by professional missions, the latter of which is visible at both the institutional (service vs. service/regulatory bureaucracies) and individual levels."
0,"Most techniques sociologists use to analyze empirical phenomena make the single equilibrium assumption that a given configuration of independent variables will produce a single outcome. The author uses two simple models to show that when the assumption does not hold, such techniques may be inadequate. The assumption, moreover, may not be valid for many social phenomena. To show this, the author takes two recent published examples of work that assumes a single equilibrium and presents models of the phenomena that suggest that assumption may not hold. The consequence of analysis that erroneously assumes a single equilibrium may be a fundamental misunderstanding of the phenomenon in question and faulty policy conclusions."
0,"Although recent scholarship has emphasized the importance of examining the rewards of raising children in understanding variations in psychological consequences of parenthood, empirical research remains focused on the demands of parenthood. Using a sample of parents with children aged 0-22 in the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 6228), this paper examines the association between age of children and parental psychological well-being, focusing on a key element of rewards of parenthood, parental relationship satisfaction with their children, as a mediator of the link. Findings indicate that parents whose oldest child is under age five report higher satisfaction with the relationship with their children, higher self-esteem, higher self-efficacy, and less depression than do parents whose oldest child is school-age or adolescent. When parental satisfaction is taken into account, the differences in self-esteem, self-efficacy, and depression by age of children disappear. "
0,"In this study, we construct a multivariate model that assesses the risk of an outbreak of civil war in a country over a period of 5 years into the future. In addition to structural factors of state weakness, which have dominated the literature on civil war onset, this model includes repression of basic human rights to personal integrity - an important harbinger of wars to come - as an aspect of state behavior. Our aim is not to explore the causal factors of civil war onset, but to build a model that includes indicators that correlate with civil war outbreak and may be used to predict it. Based on two versions of the model - logit and neural network - out-of-sample risk assessments for three different time periods are generated and compared to the historical record of civil war outbreak during those years. In addition, the model's ability to produce in-sample risk assessments over a 5-year period is tested. Finally, we compute truly predictive civil war risk assessments for all countries for which data are available, for the years 2008-2012. The analyses show that with a relatively simple model and based on publicly available data sources, meaningful civil war risk assessments can be computed. The quality of the predictions exceeds that of prominent studies, in which the risk of interstate war is assessed. "
0,"This study investigates the factors affecting the availability of health insurance, the accessibility of health care, and the dissemination of the relevant information among low-wage Chinese immigrants in Southern California by relying on the concepts of social and cultural capital. Using community-based research and in-depth interviews, our study suggests that a severe shortage in health care coverage among low-wage Chinese immigrants is influenced by the lack of employment with employer-provided health insurance within the Chinese ethnoburb community. Although the valuable social capital generated by Chinese immigrant networks seems to be sufficient enough to provide them with certain practical resources, the lack of cultural capital renders the social network rather ineffective in providing critical health care information from mainstream American society."
0,"This paper evaluates the financial implications of the target of Electricity For All set by the Central Government from the perspective of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs).   Gender and social benefits justify rural electrification, however, these are social and political objectives that are being imposed on SEBs.  The power sector is a commercial business  eventually, even SEBs have to pay their bills!  The CAPEX required for EFA is about Rs. 800,000 crs.  Additionally, SEBs are saddled with past liabilities that State Governments have guaranteed but are now unable to fund.  Given this scenario, few private players will either have the incentive or the deep pockets to make and sustain an entry into this market.  We therefore suggest that the T&D network required for EFA should be funded by the Central Government, largely through grant funding and low-cost, long-term debt to the State Governments.  We conclude that EFA must be accompanied by aggressive reforms and restructuring of the SEBs, with the objective of reducing losses and theft and improving efficiencies, so that the cost of supply can be brought down to sustainable levels and subsidies phased out.  This should be accompanied by an amendment in the Electricity Act 200,3 to ban free supply of power as it does not benefit the poor and only cripples the sector.  We support our arguments with data from MP."
0,"Previous theory and research on transnational contentious politics suggest that global civil society alliances are most successful at effecting local change when they work in concert with international organization allies and a well-organized local movement.  By empirically analyzing processes by which SMOs in the Israeli radical left peace and human rights movement mobilized international allies, resources, and campaigns during the Oslo peace process period, this article proposes that national movements can engage two modes of social change contention to externalize a local conflict.  Highlighting meso-level exchange between insider and outsider actors, the findings demonstrate how the type of social change contention influences the combination of partnerships within, and the strategic repertoires adopted by, newly forming transnational alliances.  With strategic contents and priorities of two-level alliances, moreover, being heavily determined by international allies, this article suggests that mobilization to externalize a local conflict engenders both meso-level possibilities and limitations to the contentious politics of a domestic movement."
0,"The study of civic activity has become a central focus for many social scientists over the past decade, generating considerable research and debate. Previous studies have largely overlooked the role of youth socialization into civic life, most notably in the settings of home and school. Further, differences along gender lines in civic capacity have not been given sufficient attention in past studies. This study adds to the literature by examining the potential pathways in the development of youth civic activity and potential, utilizing both gender-neutral and gender-specific structural equation modeling of data from the 1996 National Household Education Survey. Results indicate that involvement by parents in their child's schooling plays a crucial, mediating role in the relationship between adult and youth civic activity. Gender differences are minimal; thus adult school involvement is crucial for transmitting civic culture from parents to both female and male youth."
0,"This analysis investigates now the differences among citizenship status and among English proficiency affect the Latino/a baby boomer population in the U.S. using data from the American Community Survey for 2010. Unlike other baby boomers, Latino/a boomers have certain social cultural characteristics that affect their experiences in the U.S. as a racialized minority. This is seen historically through policies that have long generated the inequalities that we see today in the U.S. in everything from education, occupation, wealth, etc. Wealth is an important characteristic to be understood as it is accumulated differently by various racial and ethnic groups throughout history as a result of policies. This paper uses OLS regression, and finds that there are wealth disparities that affect Latino/as in different citizenship statuses and among those who speak English at varying degrees. It controls for other topics of interest including the region of the house as well as marital status. The analysis shows surprisingly that naturalized citizens have higher house values than both Latinos who are citizens and non-citizens, and that the ability to speak English well also increases the value of a home. These have certain implications for how the Latino/a community will not only transfer feature wealth, but also care for their aging boomer relatives. By looking into the specific differences among the baby boomer population we will attain a better idea of how this aging cohort will affect various communities (especially those of color) in years to come."
0,"The traditional Random Digit Dialing method (list-assisted RDD using a frame of landline phone numbers) is clearly under threat. The difficulty and costs of completing telephone surveys have increased due to rising rates of refusal and non-contact. The completeness of coverage of list-assisted ROD samples has diminished due to the proliferation of cell-phone only households. The ability of list-assisted ROD to capture young, mobile, unmarried, and minority households is thus diminishing as well. Increasingly, survey researchers have been adding a cell phone component to their sampling frames for telephone surveys, despite the increased costs and other issues associated with RDD calling of cell phones."
0,"In this paper we explore the ways in which corporations have become powerful actors in the political and economic landscapes, and the role that the state has played in this development. Focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, we find that revolving door practices have been a key instrument in furthering the growth of corporate power, leading us to a reconsideration of the concepts of class struggle and the role of the state in the maintenance of the dominant class’ privileges. We conclude that our findings lend support to Harvey’s theory of neoliberalism as a specific project to restore power to the dominant class, and also to Marx’s conception of state power subordinated to capitalist economic power."
0,"This article examines between-group differences in support for military action in the period since the Vietnam War. During the Vietnam War, support for military action was stronger among men, whites, the more educated, the more affluent, and younger persons. In the post-Vietnam era, men have remained consistently more supportive of military action, despite recent changes in gender roles and gender politics. Racial differences have remained strong, but not uniformly so. The gap between whites and nonwhites has been most pronounced in periods of intense partisanship or when military events have sparked a ""rally-'round-the-flag"" response that affected whites more than nonwhites. Education and income differences have generally followed a similar pattern, although there are signs of a weakening (or even reversal) of differences in attitudes to war on the education variable. Another change in the post-Vietnam era has been the relative decline in support for military action among younger persons. These data are used to explore the diverse causes and meanings of attitudes toward the use of military force and to assess the implications of the social distribution of pro-and antiwar opinion for the conduct of U. S foreign policy and political mobilization on issues of war and peace. Keywords: militarism, public opinion, foreign policy, Vietnam War, Iraq War."
0,"In this paper we examine the relationship between identification with the environmental movement and support for First Nations land claims in order to determine the potential for an environmental justice movement in British Columbia. The findings are based on survey data collected from the members of the wilderness preservation movement organization based on Vancouver Island. The findings demonstrate that the stronger an individual identifies with the environmental movement, the more s/he  supports linking First Nations land claims to conservation campaigns. We conclude by proposing that the wilderness preservation movement could increase its mobilization potential and create a unified movement to both protect the environment and ensure fair access to resources by expanding its frame to include issues of environmental justice."
0,"Between 1999 and 2004 only one article appeared in the American Sociological Review, the American Journal of Sociology, or Social Forces using primary data collected with Web-based research techniques. Since then there have been only a handful of studies published in these core sociology journals drawing on Web-based surveys or other forms of Web-based data. The use of Internet-based data has become widespread in many academic fields, especially health research and education; Web-based techniques are becoming routine in the practice and study of politics; and online commercial and market research has become a billion dollar industry. At the same time, the utility of random digit dialing surveys has eroded considerably owing to declining contact rates, increased use of technologies to screen unwanted telephone calls, and the replacement of landline telephones with cell phones. There is increasing evidence that Internet research can produce representative data. Although Web-based surveys may overrepresent some populations, Internet usage in the general population is now well over 75 per cent and is especially strong among some hard to reach populations. Internet surveys have the potential to reduce measurement error, missing data, and respondent attrition. Sociologists must overcome their fear of participation in stigmatized Internet research and actively engage in the development of techniques and refinements that will increase the utility and validity of Internet-based data collection."
0,"We use a newly developed learning model to analyze behavior in a repeated Prisoners Dilemma. At the background of our research is the question how cooperative behavior differs in good circumstances (all payoffs in the constituent PD are positive), bad circumstances (all payoffs in the constitutent PD are negative), and mixed circumstances. Though one would think that standard assumptions about peoples evaluations of gains and losses (S-shaped utility / loss aversion) favor cooperation in bad circumstances, game theoretical analyses have shown that this is, at least theoretically, not the case. Instead, as we have argued elsewhere, risk preferences of individuals matter in a surprising way. One of our theoretical claims is that risk averse individuals cooperate more often in the repeated PD. To be able to test this assertion and, more in general, to be able to analyze the behavior in repeated PDs, we developed and applied a learning model that improves upon two of the more the standard learning models in two ways. (1) It allows for statistical tests of the parameter estimates and (2) it allows for the incorporation of independent variables (e.g., subject characteristics or game characteristics). We explain the details of the model and apply it to the data of the repeated PD experiment in van Assen and Snijders (2002). We find, among other things, that in the two PDs with the lowest outcomes (i) the shadow of the future was longer, (ii) the effect of egos unilateral cooperation on cooperation was smaller, and (iii) the effect of mutual defection on cooperation was higher."
0,"Traditional research on domestic labor has conceptualized work done in support of the home as one of the quintessential ways of odoingo gender. New directions in gender and ritual theory raise the possibility that domestic labor may also be about strategy, usefulness and intentions. Through interviews with 24 married couples, I explore the subjective experiences of men and women as they odoo their domestic labor. I find that while husbands and wives are continuing to do gender as a response to interactional accountability demands, they also ouseo domestic labor as a vehicle through which they (1) reciprocally craft their gender identity, (2) symbolically communicate with their spouse, and (3) garner emotional energy. Furthermore, the men and women strategically mobilized specific tasks that are most useful in achieving these goals inside their unique dyadic schemas. Through these narratives, I explore the possibility that men and women not only do gender but they can use gender as well."
0,"Using data from a representative sample of American workers, we examine the association between education and work-family conflict-a form of inter-role conflict in which role pressures from each domain are incompatible in some way. The well-educated tend to occupy professional jobs with more income and pressures, and experience more work-family role blurring activities. These conditions contribute to greater conflict among the well-educated. In addition, people with less than a high school degree report more conflict because of their experience in precarious work with variable shifts. Finally, work-family conflict is associated with distress-but less so among those with the highest and lowest education. We discuss the theoretical relevance of these findings for views about social status, stress exposure, and their implications for mental health."
0,"In this paper, I use a post-structural political economy perspective to examine the implications for French free software communities to contribute to alternative forms of globalization from below.  First, I explore the global context within which French software politics developed.  The main French free software association is a branch of the global Free Software Foundation (FSF), which grounds its activities in what I call the freedom discourse. Through this discourse, FSF leaders articulate their goals and activities to emphasize the importance of users and developers having access to software source code.  Second,  I  explore key activities by the free software community in France, highlighting the centrality of the freedom discourse in its work and analyzing the implications for it to create alternative forms of globalization from below."
0,"This study investigates trends in gender inequality throughout the world Using data encompassing a large majority of the world's population, we examine trends in recent decades for key indicators of gender inequality in education, mortality, political representation and economic activity. We find that gender inequality is declining in virtually, all major domains, that the decline is occurring across diverse religious and cultural traditions, and that population growth is slowing the decline because populations are growing faster in countries where there is the greatest gender inequality."
0,"This study assesses the trends and differentials in length of quality life in the U.S. population as measured by happy life expectancy in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The analysis combines age-specific prevalence rates of subjective well-being from a large nationally representative survey and life table estimates of mortality in decennial Census years. Employing the period prevalence-rate life table method-Sullivan method, the analysis finds evidence for improvement in quality of life in the U.S. Happy life expectancy largely increased in both absolute terms (number of years) and relative terms (proportion of life) over time at all adult ages examined. And increases in total life expectancy were mainly contributed by increases in expectancy in happy years rather than unhappy years. Happy life expectancy is longer than active life expectancy. And there has been greater compression of unhappiness than compression of morbidity. There are substantial differentials in happy life expectancy by sex and race because of differential prevalence rates of happiness. Women and whites had longer years of total and happy life expectancies at most ages and dates, while men and blacks had greater proportions of happy life expectancies across the three decades. Although race differentials generally decreased at older ages and with time, relative disadvantages of blacks persisted. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Ecological modernization theory posits that even though economic development harms the environment, the magnitude of the harmful link decreases over the course of development. In contrast, the treadmill of production theory argues that the strong relationship between environmental harms and economic development will remain constant or possibly increase through time. To evaluate these competing propositions, interactions between economic development and time are used in cross-national panel analyses of three measures of carbon dioxide emissions. The results vary across the three outcomes as well as between developed and less developed countries, providingmixed support for both theoretical perspectives. The authors conclude by discussing how both theories could benefit from engaging contemporary research concerning changes within the transnational organization of production and the structure of international trade and how these global shifts influence environment/economic development relationships."
0,"Blacks have lower rates of substance use and abuse than whites in early adolescence and young adulthood but similar or higher rates by middle adulthood, which could be due to blacks being less likely to age (i.e., mature) out of deviance than whites by transitioning into high-quality conventional social roles. Using the National Comorbidity Survey (1990-1992), this study finds that work, economic conditions, and family roles explain the race-by-age crossover for drug abuse and explain most of this relationship for alcohol use and abuse. There is no race-by-age crossover for drug use. Thus, even though blacks have lower substance use and abuse than whites at younger ages, this advantage is eliminated and even reversed due to the disadvantages blacks face over the life course."
0,"In Nepal, there is a discrepancy between actual fertility and fertility preference.  While the mean actual fertility, as measured by total number of children ever born is 3.3, the mean desired fertility is only 2.6.  Following this observation, our main research question in the paper is to examine why such a discrepancy between actual fertility and desired fertility exists among married Nepali women.  There are three main explanations given in the paper to explore this discrepancy.  The first is preference for sons.  We hypothesize that due to son preference in Nepal, women are giving birth to more children than they desire in order to ensure that they have a son.  Second, we hypothesize that family planning media messages influence responses given by informants as they are merely giving out the socially desirable number of children as they hear through family planning campaigns.  Third, we hypothesize that due to the large unmet need of family planning, women in Nepal are not able to limit their fertility as desired.  In this paper we use the 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS).  We examine the influence of son preference, family planning media, and unmet need for contraception on the discrepancy between total number of children ever born and the desired number of children.  We also control for age, education, region of residence, and socioeconomic status as well as other proximate determinants such as age at first marriage and fecundity status.  We employ structural equation modeling in this analysis."
0,"Fear of crime has been a major research topic over the past several decades. However, multiple explanations have been proposed and no comprehensive theoretical model exists. In this study, we assess the predictive power of three theoretical models-vulnerability, disorder, and social integration-on offense type-specific, emotionally-based fear of violent and property crime. Results suggest that the predictors of fear of property and violent crime vary, and some theoretical models are a better explanation of one type of fear than the other. Overall, the models are a better fit with fear of violent crime than fear of property crime. The vulnerability model is more strongly related to fear of property crime, while the social integration model is more strongly related to fear of violent crime. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed."
0,"In Marxist theory and revolutionary praxis, the general strike has been a highly controversial working-class weapon. By studying the various forms of general strikes, we can study under what social conditions reformist versus revolutionary social movements emerge or transition into each other and why social movement organizations (SMO’s) develop differently under similar social conditions. This work moves toward the reconceptualization of the general strike and the founding of new research emphases to aid broader investigations on social movements, labor movement, world-systems, and praxis-oriented Marxist research."
0,"This paper investigates whether education buffers the impact of disability on psychological distress. And it investigates what it is about education that is most helpful, by controlling for related resources such as cognitive ability and social class. Two waves from the British National Child Development Study are used on the onset of a physical disability and psychological distress in early adulthood (between ages 23 and 33). We find that a higher education buffers the impact of disability on psychological distress. When the buffering effect of cognitive ability and social class are added simultaneously, however, the effect of education becomes insignificant. Implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"Is public debate on the Internet polarizing? Some scholars warn that Internet is an “anti-commons” where political positions are extreme, while others view the Internet as a moderating influence on political polarization. We examine polarization trends on a regional, Utah-based new website, with a random sample of 1,768 comments over a two-year period. Focusing on the most contentious issue during this time—immigration—we find that extreme ant-immigrant sentiment decreases over time despite key political and religious events. We argue that emerging public spheres, like newspaper discussion forums, might reveal a general public inclination towards moderation during heated and regional debate."
0,"Most popular and scholarly accounts assume that portray capitalist leaders are motivated by narrow material self-interest, such as greed.  In contrast to most previous research, our research is based on in-depth interviews with (male) firm leaders themselves.   We study the pleasure they take in their work, moral commitments and personal loyalties which, in addition to avarice, inspire long work days and absence from home.  Certainly, the executive men we studied recite the shareholder value creed, and they desire affluence for themselves and their families. At the same time, virtually everyone we spoke to found intrinsic value in their work.  Many seek advancement and wealth yet also view work as a means of service, a source of communion with other powerful men, and even personally redemptive.  This research is important for the any possibility of widespread success of policy efforts to change the climate and practical ethics of corporate America."
0,"Previous research examines the ecological relationship between income inequality and mortality, and results are inconclusive. This analysis builds upon these findings by implementing a spatially weighted path analysis to better understand the mediating relationships of economic and social inequality, health infrastructure, and mortality. In the analysis, overall and race-specific mortality rates are combined with local health infrastructure data, income inequality and racial segregation data, and a series of ecological controls to undertake this examination. Ultimately, findings show that income inequality is a stronger determinant of mortality than is segregation, for whites and blacks, regardless of the existing health infrastructure. We also find racial disparities in the direct effect of local health infrastructure on mortality. In contrast to previous literature suggesting no association between income inequality and mortality after accounting for race and model sophistication, we argue that the significance of the relationship persists using race-specific, spatially weighted path models."
0,"The science of environmental exposure analysis has widened its gaze from a previous focus on monitoring pollutants in outdoor environments toward measuring contaminants in microenvironments, including human bodies.  As a result, there has been a proliferation of biomonitoring and exposure assessment studies conducted by scientists and environmental advocacy organizations that assess the levels of pollutants in human body tissue and in indoor environments where humans live, work, and play. This trend has unleashed a new form of struggle for emancipatory knowledge about the body, in which communities demand the facts and causes of chemical trespass in their tissues. However, the pollutants examined in many of these studies have little or no information about their human health effects, and this paucity of health data raises ethical and scientific challenges for whether and how study results should be reported and interpreted to study participants and their communities.  We propose three frameworks for examining the science and ethics of report-back in exposure assessment studies: 1) clinical ethics; 2) community-based participatory research; and 3) citizen science data judo. While the first approach emphasizes reporting results when the health significance of exposures is known, the latter two approaches represent a new research paradigm in which study participants can potentially play a broader role in interpreting, disseminating, and ultimately leveraging results of corporal contamination to take action to promote community health.  This new frontier of research report-back in environmental health science points the way to new standards of ethical and democratic scientific practice."
0,"Traditionally, comparing to men in the U.S., women are considered disadvantaged in college attendance. However, since the 1980s, women have made substantial progress in nearly all realms of higher education. Recent government report announced that women had surpassed men in college entrance and completion since mid 1980s. Although educators, policy makers and the media have been showing increasing interest in womens achievements, there has been insufficient research on the female-leading phenomenon in education. This research uses the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health dataset, which includes a nationally stratified probability sampling of U.S. high school students, to analyze the female out-performance in college attendance. Logistic regressions and decomposition analysis indicate that among the variables that are significantly correlated with college attendance, students self-reported grade point averages explain a major proportion of the female-leading gender gap in college attendance (13%-21%), while students devotion to school-work explains 2%-4% and parents aspirations explain 2-4%. In other words, female high school students in general have higher GPAs, are more devoted to schoolwork, and receive higher aspirations from their parents than males; thus, they are more likely to go to college compared to males."
0,"Leadership is not a unitary phenomenon. While many variations are possible, leadership comes in at least two forms: emergent leaders who represent those whom they lead and imposed leaders who do not derive their authority from those they lead. This is especially true of the workplace. Management leaders, while often selected from among workers, are imposed on them from above; in contrast, union leadership claims to emerge from and to represent those they intend to lead. Union leadership, however, has embedded within it an apparent contradiction. A labor union needs to be as effective in mobilizing workers as it is democratic in representing them. This article explores the microfoundations of representative and effective leadership by analyzing workplace social networks and shows that, in our setting at least, aspiring union representatives are situated to represent well while aspiring forepersons are not. Thus, the structures of informal social networks in work groups create a social fabric that allows unions to simultaneously be a ""town hall"" and an ""army.""."
0,"This essay argues that online learning should become one of the central concerns in the contemporary sociology of education. It presents a sustained sociological mediation on the realities of online education, addresses major advantages and disadvantages to online education and offers some policy suggestions concerning how institutions and their actors should engage online education in the 21st century. The paper is structured around assessing the experiences of online education from the perspective of academic institutions, students and instructors.  In addition to being of interest to sociologists of education and other social scientists, it is also hoped that this work will also assist local actors in determining whether and to what extent they should engage online learning and help them maximize the benefits of this form of instruction while minimizing the obstacles and problems with it.  This paper argues that although online education surely has a place in higher education, academic practitioners also need to keep it in its place, and must continue to subject online – no less than traditional – education to persistent critical interrogation."
0,"This paper explores the increasing audience garnered by the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) and the expansion of auto racing into an American sports culture that has historically been dominated by football, basketball, baseball, and hockey.  By comparing NASCAR's recent growth and increased visibility to the historical factors facilitating other sports' cultural dominance, this paper argues that auto racing has cemented a presence in the limited sports space in the U.S., despite its presence having previously been ignored."

0,"Over the last decade of his career, Pierre Bourdieu changes his theory of culture, moving away from cultural relativism toward universalism.  He abandons his early concept of the cultural arbitrary, which holds there are no universal grounds for judging different cultures, and that their social value is determined solely by class power.  He now asserts that there exist cultural universals that are potentially recognized by all of humanity.  However, the dominated classes are deprived of the resources necessary for realizing these universals by the dominant class.  The assertion of these cultural universals allows Bourdieu to solve several problems with his theory identified by critics, namely, his inability to account for social change and to reflexively explain the existence of his own critical theory."
0,"This article examines the widespread resistance to condom use in sub-Saharan Africa by describing the major semiotic axes that organize how people talk about condoms and condom use. These axes include the ""sweetness"" of sex, trust and love between sexual partners, and assessments of risk and danger Using data from rural Malawi, we show that framing the meaning of condoms as a simple choice between risky behavior and rational attempts to protect one health ignores the complex semiotic space that Malawians navigate. Based on data from more than 600 diaries that record rural Malawians' everyday conversations, our analysis charts the semiotic axes related to condom use. Semiotic constraints operate most powerfully at the level of relationships. Condom use signifies a risk-v, less serious, and less intimate partner Even when people believe that condom use is appropriate, wise, or even a matter of life and death, the statement that condom use makes about a relationship usually trumps all other meanings. We call for a more nuanced analysis of culture, one that is attentive to the ways agents navigate multiple, contested meanings, and that demonstrates how specific semiotic axes are brought to bear in particular interactional contexts."
0,"This paper analyzes historical changes in American immigration law and the collective behavior of Chinese immigrants during the Chinese Exclusion Era.  I further develop a law-centered political process model of social movements by examining not only the structure of the laws, but also the specific details and practice of the anti-Chinese laws.  Using the political process models core concept of political opportunity structure, I examine legal rules and institutions, generally, and the indeterminacy of law, specifically, by analyzing the language and enforcement structure of the exclusion laws.  I present an interactive framework that considers not only how the broader political environment enabled and constrained the Chinese, but also how the Chinese responded by actively reshaping their environment.  My analysis begins by setting the historical and ideological context from which the exclusion laws emerged.  I then discuss the initial passing of anti-Chinese laws and the use of litigation in response by the Chinese.  I proceed to show how the success of Chinese litigation elicited harsher anti-Chinese laws from the federal government.  I then examine how the increased stringency of the exclusion laws resulted in the ineffectiveness of litigation, but also a more vulnerable language and enforcement structure; thus encouraging the Chinese to shift from litigation to using acts of subterfuge as a means of mobilizing.  My findings show that the Chinese exclusion laws basically fulfilled their purpose, but led to unintended consequences due to problematic language and enforcement structure."
0,"Research on inequality in education typically treats the concept of school achievement as a uniformly understood measurement of academic performance.  This assumption masks an important aspect of educational assessment: how students themselves make sense of the grades which they receive.  Research on school resistance or oppositional peer cultures approaches this crucial question of how students perceive their grades, but it is limited to studies of the intersection between race/ethnicity and school or class status and school.  Students who do not hold an oppositional attitude towards school also are confronted with the grades they receive.  My paper draws on interview data with 56 high school students in three diverse school contexts to interrogate what grades mean to them, and how their grades inform these students sense of self.  I find that students attach moral weight to grades, and that the parameters of that morality differ at each school.  Grades moral weight is associated with a sense of caring about school, and exerting effort in ones schoolwork.  This creates an identity dilemma for students who earn less-than-best grades.  Students tend to resolve this dilemma in two ways: conceding that they have not tried their bestwhich comes with a moral penalty; or conceding that they must not be quite smart enough to earn best grades.  Neither is an easy conclusion for students, and again the understandings differ at each school, nonetheless, students who care about school and feel like they try hard must make sense of receiving less-than-best grades."
0,"Why do people sometimes participate in high-risk political actions involving force or violence? Bourdieu’s field and habitus help organize findings from multiple disciplines and identify lacunae. Habitus, however, should not be viewed as a compact entity but as an internally differentiated although unified structure. I identify three habitus elements: behavioral templates, values, and institutional cultural capital, which represent the cognitive imprints of past contexts, codes, and institutions, respectively. I expect habitus effects within and across fields. I test this conceptualization using survey data from Sub-Saharan Africa and find evidence in support of it. Experience of political or domestic violence, support for political or domestic violence or for women subordination increase the likelihood of engaging in political violence controlling for organizational affiliations and other factors. These findings support feminist scholars’ rejection of the private-public sphere distinction."
0,"In sociological discourse there are two different understandings of youth, resistance, and social change.  Social movement scholars have studied youth resistance by focusing on large-scale social movements like the civil rights movement.  In a second discursive context, cultural studies scholars have widened the scope of analysis to include studies of youth subcultures, such as hip-hop.  However, in both of these discussions, researchers have overlooked resistance strategies created by teenagers, instead invoking dominant, cultural understandings of activism, which tend to focus on former civil rights leaders.  In this paper, I examine how this idealized cultural image is significant for understanding the role of popular culture in constructing youth activism and the contemporary youth movement. Using interview data collected from two years of ethnographic research with teenagers at Young People United and Project Diversity, youth empowerment organizations in Oakland, CA.  Based on these interviews, I argue that popular culture plays a significant role in the resistance strategies and activism of youth of color in the twenty-first century.  Two central questions that guide this paper are: How has an idealized cultural image of activism been constructed in popular culture?  How has youth activism and the contemporary youth movement been conceptualized in relationship to these images?"
0,"The aim of the factorial survey approach is to uncover the social and individual structures of human judgements of social objects. By having respondents evaluate samples of vignettes (fictive descriptions), in which several factors describing the object of interest are simultaneously manipulated, this approach has a number of advantages over traditional social survey research. The aim of the present article is to provide an easy-to-follow overview of the various ways in which the approach has been applied within sociology between 1982 and 2006. The review, which is based on 106 articles published in central sociology journals, is organised into three different sections: ""factorial survey applications"", ""factorial survey designs"" and ""factorial survey analyses"".

0,"This paper analyses the relationship between country-level gender empowerment and individual-level divisions of housework. Pairing the 2004 United Nations gender empowerment measure (GEM) with individual-level (n = 18,560) data from the 2004 European Social Survey, the author compares the relationship between a country's GEM score, both as an index and as disaggregated measures, and respondents' housework hours and housework proportions. The GEM index has a positive and linear relationship with men's housework hours and a positive and non-linear relationship with men and women's housework proportions and with women's housework hours. For the disaggregated GEM measures, women's representation in parliament is positively associated with men's housework hours and proportions and women's housework hours. Women's labor market status, including the percent of women in professional positions and female-male wage ratios, is negatively associated with women's housework hours and proportions. Finally, the cross-level interactions demonstrate theoretically important relationships to the housework literature. "
0,"The study of Black families is often reduced to analyses of various family structures such as types of household, number of children, and marital status.  While family structure and statistical data analyses are helpful and necessary, they also do not capture the experiences and values of families.  Thus, this paper is instead centered on understanding Black families from a Black family viewpoint.   The data for this paper is from a Black focused parenting magazine, Raising Black and Biracial Children.  I found that through analyzing a magazine catered to Black families and distributed nationally, I could attain one type of insight into the issues that concern Black parents.  I analyzed twenty-six issues from 1995 to 2002, a total of 99 articles, and found for four primary themes: racism, Afro-centrism, slavery, and comparisons to Whites.  In this paper, I discuss passages from several articles which highlight each theme to reveal how these issues are discussed, evaluate the importance of them to Black families, and show how they are not just factors affecting Black families but also utilized in daily life."
0,"Most prior research testing the hypothesis of the social disorganization theory that residential instability increases crime has used cross-sectional data. Using a unique dataset linking home sales address matched to census tracts with crime data in Los Angeles, we test the direction of this relationship using a six-year panel data design. We also test whether crime acts as a generator of transition and decline in neighborhoods by testing its effect on property values the following year. Our findings suggest little evidence that home sales volatility in one year leads to more property or violent crime the following year. Instead, higher levels of tract property and violent crime in one year lead to more home sales the following year. This effect of high crime rates is exacerbated in tracts with high levels of racial/ethnic heterogeneity, suggesting that such tracts may engender a distinct combination of fear and uncertainty in their residents, leading to more turn over. We also find that tracts with more violent crime one year have lower property values the following year, suggesting a general process of decline."
0,"To test claims that postcolonial civil violence is a common legacy of colonialism, we create a dataset on the colonial heritage of 160 countries and explore whether a history of colonialism is related to indicators of inter-communal conflict, political rebellion and civil war in the years 1960-1999. The analysis provides evidence against sweeping claims that colonialism is a universal cause of civil violence but finds that some forms of colonialism increase the risk of some forms of civil violence. Specifically, the findings support claims that inter-communal violence is a common legacy of colonialism-especially of British colonialism and colonialism by minor colonial powers-but suggest that a history of colonialism has only a limited impact on political rebellion and civil war."
0,"Several studies have recently found that world income inequality declined during the closing years of the twentieth century. However, these studies feature a number of shortcomings, including the use of outdated national income estimates to measure inequality between countries, as well as sparse data to capture the smaller (but growing) component found within countries. The current study addresses these concerns and offers new estimates of world income inequality based on 151 countries covering 95 percent of the world's population during the 1990-2008 period. Overall, the results are fairly compatible with prior efforts, lending greater confidence to earlier findings. Nevertheless, the results suggest that prior studies covering the 1990s overestimate the decline in between-country inequality, but underestimate the rise in within-country inequality. Consequently, total inequality did not begin to decline substantially until the post-2000 era. After presenting these estimates, I then examine factors associated with income mobility among the 15,100 subnational percentile groups in my data set. The results suggest that (a) the negative effect of inequality is larger than the positive effect of economic growth among the poorest 25 percent of the world's population, and (b) late industrialization has contributed to income convergence between countries, while economic globalization has primarily served to stretch income distributions within nations."
0,"How do gender, race, and class affect adolescent body image? Using a survey questionnaire, I examine the body image satisfaction of 13-15 boys and girls. To supplement this quantitative data, I draw on qualitative methods to examine how the daily experiences and lives are affected by the intersections of race, class, and generational status, and the way in which girls body vary given these intersections. Specifically, in-depth interviews capture the influences, experiences and perceptions that affect the body image of Mexican immigrants, Mexican American, and white girls ages 13-15. Existing research finds Latinas share similar body images as whites, but these analyses fail to address intersecting factors. I use literature to guide my investigation of an age group particularly susceptible to internalizing media generated ideal bodies, provide insights into how girls manage these images and their consequences. Although recent studies include Latinas, this work presumes a monolithic group where ethnic and class differences are oversimplified. In addition to examining the effects of race and classfactors already known to be important on body image, I examine empirical issues specifically addressing body image using literature as it relates to race and skin color, and class differences within ethnic groups."
0,"Most social movement scholars attribute activists choices of strategies and tactics to rational decisions based on personal preferences, past experiences, or opponents abilities to sanction. But these explanations cannot account for instances when activists knowingly choose strategies and tactics that do not seem to offer the likeliest chance of success. What can account for these seemingly irrational choiceswhy would activists purposefully avoid likely successful strategies and tactics? I address this question through a comparative study of the animal rights movements in France and the United States, based on interviews and participant observation with activists in both countries. Activists in the U.S. exhibit more tactical pragmatism than French activists, who engage in tactical stubbornnesssometimes refusing tactics and strategies that have proven successful for others. I argue that these choices are not irrational, and surprisingly are not based on cultural or structural constraints external to the movement. Instead, they are indicative of the constraints placed on activists by the cultural structures within the animal rights movement itself. This meso-level analysis adds a new level to studies of tactical choices, and also provides a comparative perspective to an empirical case of cultural structures and agency."
0,"E-mail excludes the multiple nonlinguistic cues and gestures that facilitate face-to-face communication. How, then, should interaction in a text-based context be understood? The authors analyze the problems and solutions experienced by a research panel that communicated over e-mail and face-to-face for 18 months, evaluating both kinds of exchanges alongside survey and interview data. Semiotic and linguistic theory is used to expose essential properties associated with the successful communication of meaning in each context. The authors find that e-mail requires the cultivation of new techniques for specifically conveying the ""pragmatic information"" that connects the meaning of words to their users. Such information is assigned in e-mail through the use of what are termed emphatic, referential, and characterizing semiotic tactics. These tactics are also evident in sustained online interactions studied by other researchers. This theoretical vocabulary represents an alternative to the dominant sociological characterization of e-mail as an inferior substitute for face-to-face interaction."
0,"This study assesses changes in sex and race disparities in health over the life course and across cohorts by conducting growth curve analyses of nationally representative longitudinal data that spans 15 years. It finds that changes in disparities in depressive symptoms, disability and self-assessments of health across the life course are cohort-related phenomena: (1. there is significant inter-cohort heterogeneity in health trajectories; (2. intra-cohort sex and race inequalities exist in levels of health but not in growth rates of all health problems; (3. there are inter-cohort variations in the intra-cohort heterogeneity - sex and race gaps change across cohorts in levels of health. Changes in the sex gap in growth rates of depression are also strongly contingent upon cohort membership."
0,"The dramatic increase in Hispanic immigration to the United States in recent decades has been coterminous with fundamental shifts in the labor market towards heightened flexibility, instability, and informality. As a result, the low-wage labor market is increasingly occupied by Hispanic immigrants, many of whom are undocumented. While numerous studies examine the implications for natives' employment prospects, our understanding of low-wage immigrants themselves remains underdeveloped. Drawing on original data collected in Durham, North Carolina, this article provides a more holistic account of immigrant Hispanic's labor market experiences, examining not only wages but also employment instability and benefit coverage. The analysis evaluates the role of human capital and immigration characteristics, including legal status, in shaping compensation outcomes, as well as the influence of other employment characteristics. Findings highlight the salience of nonstandard work arrangements such as subcontracting and informal employment to the labor market experiences of immigrant Hispanic men, and describe the constellation of risk factors that powerfully bound immigrant employment outcomes."
0,"The problem of age discrimination persists in European societies despite multitude of policies and legal solutions to eliminate it. The aging of the population and future shortages in labor force pose a radical challenge to the European governments to remedy the growing problem. One of the measures is tackling the age discrimination experienced by the older workers and precluding them from taking new jobs. The paper presents the results of the survey among Polish population over the age of 45 about the age discrimination experiences in their working lives. The survey draws on previous research projects in this area (European Social Survey, Eurobarometer), but follows different methodological path."
0,"The research reported here used measures of marital success based on both marital survival and marital quality to assess how well first marriages entered at relatively late ages fare in comparison with those entered younger. Analysis of data from five American data sets indicated that the later marriages fare very well in survival but rather poorly in quality. The greatest indicated likelihood of being in an intact marriage of the highest quality is among those who married at ages 22-25, net of the estimated effects of time since first marriage and several variables that might commonly affect age at marriage and marital outcomes. The negative relationship beyond the early to mid-twenties between age at marriage and marital success is likely to be at least partially spurious, and thus it would be premature to conclude that the optimal time for first marriage for most persons is ages 22-25. However, the findings do suggest that most persons have little or nothing to gain in the way of marital success by deliberately postponing marriage beyond the mid-twenties. "
0,"This article seeks to identify the mechanisms underlying the gender wage gap among new lawyers. Relying on nationally representative data to examine the salaries of lawyers working fulltime in private practice, we find a gender gap of about 5 percent. Identifying four mechanisms-work profiles, opportunity paths and structures, credentials, and legal markets-we first estimate how Much of the gap stems from the differential valuation of women's endowments; second, we estimate the effects of different endowments for men and women; and third we assess both these possibilities. The analyses indicate that none of these mechanisms can fully account for the gender gap. Experimental studies that indicate womens work is less valued and rewarded than men's suggest new directions for research on gendered compensation."
0,"In a world increasingly defined by market relations, capitals search for cheaper and more flexible labor is encroaching on grass roots cultural activities in its quest for profit. During the 1960s, Irish emigrants began meeting in pubs to play Irish traditional music together. These social events were spontaneous gatherings of musicians who shared and played tunes with one another without regard for hierarchical social arrangements or for economic gain. This situation was short-lived, as pub owners discovered that providing live music for customers generated business. Musicians were willing to play for hours in exchange for only a few free pints of beer . As sessions have been increasingly commodified, these grass roots social practices have changed in significant ways. One of the most noteworthy is that musicians who once played music in pubs as a leisure activity are now playing the music as a form of work. However, not all of the musicians who play music in sessions are paid for their labor. In this paper, I investigate the ways sessions have been organized as work environments, the various ways musicians who are paid for their labor attempt to manage session musicians as workers and how those who are not paid for their labor resist these constraints."
0,"A growing body of literature in a variety of disciplines has appeared over the last 20 years examining customer racial bias in the secondary sports card market; however, consensus on the matter has yet to emerge. In this article, we explore the more subtle ways that a player's race/ethnicity may affect the value of his sports card including a player's skin tone (light- to dark-skinned). Data were obtained for 383 black, Latino, and white baseball players who had received at least one vote for induction into Major League Baseball's Hall of Fame including their career performance statistics, rookie card price, card availability, Hall of Fame status, and skin tone. Findings indicate that card availability is the primary determinant of card value while a player's skin tone has no direct effect. Subsequent analysis demonstrates that a player's race (white/non-white) rather than skin tone did have an effect as it interacts with Hall of Fame status to influence his rookie card price."
0,"This study analyzes why the world's most economically advanced countries have deindustrialized over the last few decades. Previous research focuses on three causal factors: (1) rising consumer affluence and its propensity to increase demand for services more than for manufactured goods, (2) faster productivity growth in the manufacturing sector relative to other sectors, and (3) expanding trade linkages between the North and the South of the global economy. The relative importance of these factors, however, is not fully understood, because previous research has not tested all of these explanations simultaneously nor considered the indirect channels through which global trade may cause deindustrialization. This study tests the three factors with two-way fixed-effects regression models and panel data on 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003. The results indicate that each factor makes significant contributions to deindustrialization, and that global trade exerts both direct and indirect effects on employment patterns in economically advanced countries, but that the single greatest factor comes from the steadily rising affluence of consumers in these countries."
0,"How do animals become problems? Drawing on interactionist theories of social problems and cultural geography, I argue that the construction of animals as problems relies upon cultural understandings of nature/culture relationships, which in turn entail ""imaginative geographies."" Specifically, modernity posits a firm boundary between nature and culture. Animals have their place, but are experienced as ""out of place""-and often problematic-when they are perceived to transgress spaces designated for human habitation. Relying on New York Times articles from 1851 to 2006, and articles from 51 other newspapers from 1980 to 2006, this article focuses on the process by which pigeons as a species were problematized. I contend that pigeons have come to represent the antithesis of the ideal metropolis, which is orderly and sanitized, with nature subdued and compartmentalized. While typified as a health issue, the pigeon's primary ""offense"" is that it ""pollutes"" habitats dedicated for human use. The catch phrase ""rats with wings"" neatly summarizes society's evaluations of, and anxieties about, this bird. This metaphor reflects a framing of pigeons by claims-makers that renders them out of place in the cityscape. This study expands social problems theorizing to more thoroughly account for animals and the role of space."
0,"Political opportunity theory proposes that “political opportunities” precede mobilization in the first instance and independently generate insurgency. Conversely, I propose that it is how particular insurgent practices interact with particular historical circumstances – the extent to which the insurgent practices disrupt a hegemonic process in ways that are hard to repress in the given circumstances – that determines insurgent influence. I strategically test these competing propositions by re-analyzing the archetypal case upon which political opportunity theory was built – namely Truman’s adoption of civil rights advocacy. I argue that instead of preceding Black insurgency in the first instance, Black Anti-colonial insurgency in 1946 compelled Truman’s abrupt conversion into an avid advocate of civil rights. Then rather than increasing Black insurgent influence generally, as political opportunity theory suggests it should, Truman’s civil rights advocacy contributed to Black Anti-colonialism’s swift decline."
0,"Sociologists have long used educational expectations to understand the complex mental processes underlying individuals' educational decision making. Yet, little research evaluates how students actually formulate their educational expectations. Status attainment theory asserts that students adopt their educational expectations early based on family background and social influences, and that their educational expectations are driven by a static mental construct as a result. In contrast, recent research based on Bayesian learning theory hypothesizes that students mostly adapt their educational expectations in light of new information about their academic potential. Comparing models of expectations formation in adolescence, we find that students' expectations do not derive from a static mental construct. However, students adapt their educational expectations only modestly and only in response to very large changes in grade point averages. Thus, adolescent educational expectations stabilize early and are rather persistent over time."
0,"Higher-status occupations, like professionals or managers, are traditionally regarded as high-paying jobs with abundant resources, prestige and privilege. However, recently, scholars found that higher-status people are more likely to internalize the organization culture and rules and as a result, tend to report more job involvement and commitment, long work hours and job overload. These workplace demands attached to the higher status further produce stress-related mental health. The paradoxical characteristics of occupation are summarized in Stress of Higher Status hypothesis and resource of higher status hypothesis. The current study aims to test these two hypotheses by examining the suppression effects of workplace demands and the mediating effects of work resources between occupation, education and perceived stress; it also expands the hypotheses by investigate the moderator role of gender in the processes. For this purpose, 2008 National Study of Changing Workforce dataset was adopted and Markov Chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation technique was applied. Results of stepwise OLS regression mostly support Stress of Higher Status hypothesis: job overload and work-to-family conflict suppress the association between occupation, education and perceived stress while working overtime does not. The moderator influence of gender is also revealed with some complexities. The findings of this study facilitate the understanding of stress process and interaction between social status, workplace and health outcomes."
0,"This paper takes a broad view of innovation by investigating product success among U.S. biotechnology firms across various stages of innovation including product discovery, product development, and product success. Current explanations of biotechnology product success examine one or two stages of innovation and underscore the importance of strategic alliances. However, current explanations are incomplete. First, they fail to examine whether their explanations hold across the entire innovation process. Second, estimates suggest that up to 70% of strategic alliances fail to meet their objectives (Kale and Singh 2009) and product develop remains very costly despite the high incidence of alliances in the biotechnology industry. I hypothesize product discovery is associated with product discovery, product development is associated with learning between strategic alliance partners, and product success is associated with the firm’s overall strategic alliance network. Results from regression models for a sample of large biotechnology firms confirm hypotheses."
0,"Analyses of the National Crime Victimization Survey and Supplemental Homicide Reports show that southern whites are much more likely than northern whites to be victims of gun homicides and assaults, but not other homicides and assaults. While blacks are more likely than whites to be victims of gun assaults (regardless of region). they have lower risks of assault victimization by unarmed offenders. The patterns are inconsistent with the subculture of violence thesis. In addition, incident analyses reveal that patterns of weapon use primarily reflect the race of the victim not the offender. Our results point to the importance of adversary effects: Offenders avoid assaulting blacks and southern whites unless they have guns because members of these groups are perceived as a greater threat. We suggest that the prevalence of armed assault in a community may lower the likelihood of unarmed assaults, and that honor culture explanations may be salvageable. "
0,"Doubt plays a central role within pragmatism’s philosophical anthropology upon which pragmatic conceptions of truth, epistemology, morality, and political theory are built. This paper takes the position that pragmatism’s philosophical anthropology is basically correct, but that it is incomplete. What follows is an attempt to provide a roadmap for how sociology might be particularly well-suited to do fill in that gap. First, I will explore the role of doubt within classical pragmatism. I will then explore what the sociology of organizations—in particular, the research falling under a broad umbrella organizational knowledge and cognition—has said about the nature of knowledge and thought.  Finally, I will attempt to recover the pragmatist conception of real, practical doubt and suggest ways that that the sociological study of organizations can add to our understanding of the social conditions that make doubt and creative action possible."
0,"Corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other organizational forms are major players in the sodal world. Recently, sociological scholarship on organizations has converged with research on the professions to discuss the ways in which professions are shaped or influenced by different organizational forms. In this article, I borrows from the notion of framing within social movement research to argue that organizational forms frame the bids of aspiring professionals. More specifically, I argue that certain organizational forms-such as that of the modern corporation-can aid would-be professionals in making their claims for professional recognition. Organizations do this, I argue, by providing aspiring professionals with a ready-made setting, rationale, and guarantees that make the newcomers more easily recognizable as professionals to outside audiences. I explore this argument by examining how the corporate form has facilitated private military contractors in their attempts to legitimate and develop this highly controversial new industry. The data are drawn from my interviews with private military contractors, state officials, and other interested parties surrounding private military corporations, as well as from archival data that detail the rise of the private military industry."
0,"This paper examines gender differences in the emotional experiences and expressions of men and women in the workplace.  The belief in American culture that women are more emotional than men has limited womens opportunities in many types of work.  Because emotional expression is often tightly controlled in the workplace, examining emotion management performed at work presents an opportunity to evaluate gender differences in response to similar working conditions.  Previous research suggests that men and women do not differ in their experiences of emotion, and the expression of emotion is linked to status positions.  Individuals in high status positions have more freedom in their expressions of anger than lower status individuals while individuals in low status positions often have to express happiness as a sign of deference to others.  An analysis of survey data collected from workers in a diverse group of occupations illustrates that women are less expressive of anger and more expressive of happiness than men in the workplace.  Job status characteristics explain the association between gender and managing anger at work but were unrelated to the expression of happiness in the workplace.  This research suggests that structural factors may account for gender differences in anger expression, but gender differences in the expression of happiness are more consistent with cultural norms of emotional expression."
0,"Do peer influences have the same effect on religious and nonreligious youth, or does religiosity reduce the effect of peers on delinquency? Using data from the National Youth Survey, we examined the interaction of religiosity and peer influences on marijuana use, alcohol use, hitting, and property offenses. The results suggest that, for marijuana use and alcohol use, three measures of peer influence-peer attitudes, behaviors, and pressure-have weaker effects on religious adolescents. Thus, even when religious youth are exposed to peers who encourage substance use, religiosity may serve as a protective factor that reduces the effect of peers. In contrast, religiosity does not seem to condition the effect of peers on hitting and property offenses."
0,"What happens to family relations when an adolescent and her parent do not share the same religious convictions or practices? Whereas previous work on religion and intergenerational relations looks at relationships between parents and their adult children, we shift the focus to younger families, assessing how parent-child religious discord affects adolescents' evaluation of their relationship with their parents. Exploring data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find several interesting patterns of association between religious discord and parent-child relations. Overall, religious discord predicts lower quality intergenerational relations. When parents value religion more than their teens do, adolescents tend to report poorer relations with parents. Relationship quality is not lower, however, when it is the adolescent who values religion more highly. We also find that religious discord is more aggravating in families where parent and child share religious affiliation and in families where the parent is an evangelical Protestant. "

0,"This article examines how educational disparities in mortality emerge, grow, decline, and disappear across causes of death in the United States, and how these changes contribute to the enduring association between education and mortality over time. Focusing on adults age 40 to 64 years, we first examine the extent to which educational disparities in mortality persisted from 1989 to 2007. We then test the fundamental cause prediction that educational disparities in mortality persist, in part, by shifting to new health outcomes over time. We focus on the period from 1999 to 2007, when all causes of death were coded to the same classification system. Results indicate (1) substantial widening and narrowing of educational disparities in mortality across causes of death, (2) almost all causes of death with increasing mortality rates also had widening educational disparities, and (3) the total educational disparity in mortality would be about 25 percent smaller today if not for newly emergent and growing educational disparities since 1999. These results point to the theoretical and policy importance of identifying social forces that cause health disparities to widen over time."
0,"There is a large body of research that shows children from non-intact homes show higher rates of juvenile delinquency than children from intact homes, partially due to weaker parental control and supervision in non-intact homes. What has not been adequately addressed in the research is the influence of changes in family structure among individual adolescents over time on delinquent offending. Using the first and third waves of the National Youth Study, we assess the effect of family structure changes on changes in delinquent offending between waves through the intermediate process of changes in family time and parental attachment. Although prior research has documented adolescents in broken homes are more delinquent than youth in intact homes, the process of family dissolution is not associated with concurrent increases in offending. In contrast, family formation through marriage or cohabitation is associated with simultaneous increases in offending. Changes in family time and parental attachment account for a portion of the family formation effect on delinquency, and prior parental attachment and juvenile offending significantly condition the effect of family formation on offending."
0,"Most effective practitioners of science, technology and engineering in Western countries are white males.  A variety of studies have raised the question of why women are underrepresented in those fields.  In this research, as one part of three consecutive studies, I endeavored to focus on the circumstance women experience as a marginalized population in a male-dominated academic field through two focus group meetings with female engineering students and a survey of 273 engineering students at a large research university.  It was found that female students were more likely to consider or attempt to leave engineering programs.  There was a significant difference by gender for leaving consideration or attempt in White engineering students, while there was no significant difference by gender in minority students.  On the other hand, female engineering students still experienced difficulties for completing engineering careers in various ways, and specifically, they experienced the dilemmas of interaction with men and still being a woman:."
0,"Drawing on structural racism and urban disadvantage approaches, this article posits a broad influence of citywide racial residential segregation on levels of violent crime across all urban neighborhoods regardless of their racial/ethnic composition. Multilevel models based on data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study for 7,622 neighborhoods in 79 cities throughout the United States reveal that segregation is positively associated with violent crime for white and various types of nonwhite neighborhoods. Nonetheless, there is a lack of parity in violence across these types of communities reflecting the larger racialized social system in which whites are able to use their privileged position to reside in the most advantaged neighborhoods, while African-Americans and Latinos live in the most disadvantaged urban communities and therefore bear the brunt of urban criminal violence."
0,"This article uses panel data collected at the block group level from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census to explore neighborhood change in the Silicon Valley region of Northern California. This was a period of rapid economic expansion and displacement of the white majority by immigrants of Asian and Hispanic descent. The argument that economic prosperity promotes ethnic group assimilation is confronted by mixed findings that ethnic residential segregation intensified in Silicon Valley during the 1990s, regardless of the income level of neighborhoods, and that some second generation immigrants have begun to assimilate residentially. Results support the argument that more recent immigrants, regardless of education, are likely to reside in areas populated by members of their ethnic group. In addition, upward mobility does not necessarily mean ethnic minorities will leave ethnic neighborhoods and desegregate the larger metropolitan area, which also creates the potential for proliferation of more affluent ethnic neighborhoods."
0,"The proliferation of definitions and applications of social capital has prompted debate regarding the usefulness of the concept; there is thus an urgent need for a more rigorous usage of the term. This article proposes a distinction between three meaningful variants within the concept of social capital for the purpose of an improved dialogue and a sharpened application. The differences between these three variants-relational, collective, and generalized social capital-are first illuminated through a conceptual discussion. An empirical analysis testing the linkages between relational and collective social capital is then provided in the context of a household disaster preparedness study in Dominica. Together, analytical and empirical evidence supports the idea that social capital covers a variety of interrelated, yet distinct, social processes that operate simultaneously and may serve different purposes. On the basis of these results, this article calls for a theoretically and empirically meaningful treatment of social capital in terms of its three variants. "
0,"The migration of millions of southerners out of the South between 1910 and 1970 is largely attributed to economic and social push factors in the South, combined with pull factors in other regions of the country. Researchers generally find that participants in this migration were positively selected from their region of origin, in terms of educational attainment and urban status, and that they fared relatively well in their destinations. To fully measure the migrants' success, however, a comparison with those who remained in the South is necessary. This article uses data from the U.S. Census to compare migrants who left the South with their southern contemporaries who stayed behind, both those who moved within the South and the sedentary population. The findings indicate that migrants who left the South did not benefit appreciably in terms of employment status, income, or occupational status. In fact, inter-regional migrants often fared worse than did southerners who moved within the South or those who remained sedentary. These results contradict conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of exiting the South and suggest the need for a revisionist interpretation of the experiences of those who left."
0,"The paper discusses the current state of Russias developing insurance market, particularly the ways insurers price risk and establish premiums. The Russian insurance market is new and it is developing in the context of macro-economic transition, and legal and regulatory vacuum. Whatever state-collected data are available to commercial insurance companies might be of questionable quality. Yet, because most companies do not specialize in a particular line of insurance, they do not have enough data of their own in any of the lines. Fierce competition and little rate regulation prevent data sharing and pooling between companies. Together with the lack of control over the quality of insurance services this makes many companies engage in price dumping when they offer premiums that are below any reasonable levels. In fact, unrestrained competition in a market where rates are not regulated makes insurance companies ignore data even where they have been accumulated. In the absence of means to turn uncertainty into risk, Russian insurers shadow-price each other, and resort to guess-work when determining premiums. They also sometimes take into consideration their customers perceived ability to pay, offering higher premiums to more able ones. The role of cooperation in setting premiums is emphasized. Whether the insurance market is successful in Russia will depend on how well insurers manage to replace opportunism and competitiveness by intra organizational trust and cooperation."
0,"This study combines data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with data from four censuses to examine the effects of foreign-born populations in the immediate and surrounding neighborhoods of residence on native-born black and white householders' residential mobility decisions. We find that the likelihood of out-mobility for native householders is significantly and positively associated with the relative size of, and increases in, the immigrant population in a neighborhood. Consistent with theoretical arguments related to the distance dependence of mobility, large concentrations of immigrants in surrounding areas reduce native out-mobility, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of the most likely mobility destinations. A sizable share of local immigration effects can be explained by the mobility-related characteristics of native-born individuals living in immigrant-populated areas, but the racial composition of a neighborhood (for native whites) and local housing-market conditions (for native blacks) are also important mediating factors. We discuss the implications of these patterns for processes of neighborhood change and broader patterns of residential segregation."

This research uses six waves of the Health and Retirement Survey (1992 to 2002) to investigate this possibility with respect to financial transfers from parents to their adult children. We find that although divorced single fathers continue to make transfers to their adult biological children, remarriage substantially reduces fathers' transfers while it increases mothers' transfers to their biological children. Our findings are consistent with both socio-evolutionary and exchange theories predicting women's vs. men's investments in biological vs. stepchildren."

Despite my efforts at carefully cultivating an identity as an aca/fan (a researcher who identifies as both a fan and a scholar of fandom), my identity as a pregnant woman was most salient throughout my field work.  Because of the particular genre of fanfiction, male pregnancy, which my participants engaged with, my status as what Reich (2003) refers to as a “normative reproducer” negatively affected the research process. Instead of being viewed as non-threatening, my pregnancy enhanced the stigma already felt by authors of male pregnancy fan fiction (Penley 1997). This research contributes to a larger body of work on the role of the researcher in field research and a much smaller body of work on the role of pregnant researchers, in particular."

0,"Our study analyzes how political context, embodied by the welfare state and Leftist political actors, shapes individual poverty. Using the Luxembourg Income Study, we conduct a multi-level analysis of working-aged adult poverty across 18 affluent Western democracies. Our index of welfare generosity has a negative effect on poverty net of individual characteristics and structural context. For each standard deviation increase in welfare generosity, the odds of poverty decline by a factor of 2.3. The odds of poverty in the United States (the least generous welfare state) are greater by a factor of 16.6 than a person with identical characteristics in Denmark (the most generous welfare state). Significant interaction effects suggest that welfare generosity reduces the extent to which low education and the number of children increase poverty. Also, welfare generosity reduces poverty among those with low education, single-mother households and young households. We show that Leftist parties and union density reduce the odds of poverty, however their effects channel through the welfare state. Ultimately, poverty is shaped both by individual characteristics and the political context in which the individual resides."
0,"By applying signaling theory to the strategies gangs and their prospective members adopt during the recruitment process, this article addresses one of the most crucial unanswered questions in the literature on street gangs: why, in any given pool of individuals with similar sociological profiles and motivations, do only some gain entry into gangs? Based upon two years of ethnographic fieldwork with gang members in London, UK, this article argues that gangs face a primary trust dilemma in their uncertainty over the quality of recruits. Given that none of the desirable trust-warranting properties for gang membership can be readily discovered from observation, gangs look for observable signs correlated with these properties. Gangs then face a secondary trust dilemma in their uncertainty over the reliability Of signs because certain agents (e.g., police informants, rival gang members, and adventure seekers) might mimic them. Thus, gangs look for signs that are too costly for mimics to fake but affordable for the genuine article. This article thus demonstrates how gangs overcome their informational handicap ex ante by screening and selecting among prospective members based on ""hard-to-fake"" signals."
0,"This study examines whether or not subjective social status rankings differ according to social characteristics. A Probit analysis was conducted on 10,282 participants to test whether social position predicts higher or lower subjective rankings relative to one’s community or nation. Socially advantaged respondents ranked themselves higher in national comparisons, while disadvantaged respondents ranked themselves higher in community comparisons. Some social position characteristics predicted the magnitude of difference in rankings. These findings demonstrate meaningful differences in how individuals rank themselves on subjective scales according to objective measures of social standing. These differences should be considered in future research utilizing subjective social status scales."
0,"Analysts in the subfield of social movements recognize the importance of culture, and by extension, artistic mediums to facilitating solidarity between members of a community that in turn spurs them to social or political action. This study uses both primary and secondary sources to examine theatrical works linked to the Chicano movement. In particular, we are interested in the ways dimensions of collective identity such as negotiation, boundaries, and consciousness surface in narratives or texts. Theatrical scripts, we argue, give clear indications of group mobilization efforts. Through a textual analysis of plays, we also observe that Chicano theater draws on group history, language, and folklore as it defines and reinforces identity. Analyzing works of theater from the 1960s Chicano movement, along with contemporary pieces, provides a look into the ways that collective identity is used in different time periods, in comparable and contrasting ways, and shows both the constancy and trajectory of the movement."
0,"Circumcision is known to be the oldest and one of the most controversial procedures in the history of humanity by historians, academics, and other scholars alike. The choice to circumcise male infants is seen as a deeply personal decision usually thought of being in the hands of parents. However, new research demonstrates that doctors have increasingly medicalized the procedure of circumcision and have not supplied parents with adequate information in order to make an informed decision about whether or not to circumcise their male infants. In this paper, I provide a history of male circumcision within the United States, discuss national rates, and locate its discourse within an increasingly medicalized context. I demonstrate how newer social movements have attempted to reframe the procedure as a human rights violation with links to sexual citizenship rights. I provide a brief rebuttal to the human rights debate by discussing a common Jewish argument in which preventing the practice of religion (circumcising infant males) is a violation of human rights instead.  These common debates demonstrate a need to balance the rights of infants as autonomous individuals with the rights of groups (both secular and religious) in order to understand that both cultural and religious practices are static, nor do cultural or religious aspects make up the only dimension of an individual or group. It is important to look at political, economic, and legal rights as they are understood by particular individuals and groups and how those rights intersect with Westernized conceptions of human rights."
0,"This paper presents an overview of arguments and evidence from the forthcoming book, Nations of Flesh and Blood: Gender, Race and National Identity. The central contention of the work is that discourses of national identity are routinely gendered and racialized in ways that both reflect and reinforce the marginalization of women and ethnoracial minorities. The empirical evidence examined spans a ten-year period and is drawn from four nations: the US, the UK, Australia and Japan. The paper summarizes conclusions from analyses of television advertisements, Olympic opening ceremonies, news coverage of the Iraq War, post-9-11 letters to the editor, travel brochures, national museums and living history venues in the nations examined, and discusses the broader theoretical and practical implications of these findings."
0,"Supporting the development of healthy children is a goal for parents.  Proper development becomes a challenge when children do not receive adequate health care, educational enrichment, and housing.  These challenges are amplified in the US-Mexico border region. This study looks specifically at child development and family characteristics in two poor colonias (neighborhoods) in Ciudad Juárez (Chihuahua, Mexico).  It relies on and extends from a project conducted by a local community groups Gente a favor de Gente. Families living in these two areas are poor, Hispanic residents.  Parents with children between 0 to 3 years old were surveyed about their access to economic, cultural, and social capital and the child was given Doll and Denver tests to measure his/her developmental age.  Using the survey and results from the development tests, the analysis explores how relationships between economic, cultural, and social capital and child development vary among parents surveyed.  More social capital was found to be an influence on higher development scores, with economic capital also being important.  Differences in capital can contribute to understanding the of parents experiences in child rearing in two poor colonias in Ciudad Juárez (Chihuahua, Mexico)."
0,"In this paper, I analyze collective processes of making sense of periods of extreme political violence based on fundamental texts produced after the end of the last military dictatorship in Argentina.  By looking into the Nunca Mas (Never Again) report prepared by the National Commission on the Disappearance of People (CONADEP), which included hundreds of testimonies by survivors of torture and acquaintances, reading scholarly analyses on this matter, and finding testimonies published in other venues, I discuss how this report became a master narrative from which subsequent interpretations of the Dirty War emerged.  I apply Goffman’s (1986) frame analysis theory to understand the complexities and nuances of processes of collective memory-making, and identify how hegemonic and counter-hegemonic frames were used to create meanings and organize experiences of the so-called Dirty War.  Then, I propose alternative frames (an “intersectional frame” and an “emotions-conscious frame”) with the aim of contributing to ongoing and long-lasting collective efforts to comprehend this phase of history.  While this use of frame analysis may be considered unorthodox given that scholars do not generally impose a frame on a document, I intend to demonstrate the power of framing and reframing as tools to animate what existing frames may be masking and thus reach deeper levels of comprehension."
0,"Postindustrial society presents a landscape of informatized production staffed by service workers at two extremes: those who care for anything from networked machines that produce images, information, and commercial culture to those whose caring falls to the messy materiality of medicalized bodies. This paper is aimed at exploring the notion of affective labor, or the immaterial labor to produce affects (feelings, thoughts, impulses, ideas), that arguably characterizes service, care, and cultural work in postindustrial settings. I argue that the immaterial labor of affective production is a concept that usefully extends the idea of emotional labor beyond gender, and affords a unique window on the incalculable nature of affective production. Using a case study of 21 fashion models interviewed in New York City, this paper explores the qualities of affective labor at both ends of its spectrum by comparing the affective labor of modeling as documented by this study, to a similar study of home health care workers emotional labor. The ungovernable qualities of affect lead to an irrational relationship between hours worked and pay received, as underpayment and exploitation at the low end, and wildly variable payment at the high end.  I conclude that both fashion modeling and care works value is incalculable by normal standards  its commerce in affect makes it impossible to contain within normal working hours, or traditional work norms."
0,"This study investigates how bilingualism affects the earnings of the 1.5 and the 2nd generation Hispanic and Asian workers.  Utilizing the U.S. census 2000 PUMS 5% data, three major Hispanic groups (Mexicans, Cubans, and Dominicans) and three Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Filipinos, and Koreans) are selected.  Then, six separate regressions are applied in order to examine how bilingualism differently affects the wage of private sector workers in each of these six groups.  This study eventually introduces a multi-level analysis to investigate how random coefficients of bilingualism vary among metropolitan areas of different contexts utilizing a statistical multi-level modeling."
0,"We use the National Violence against Women (and Men) Survey to examine the effects of region and race on the tendency to carry weapons for protection. We find that Southern and Western whites are much more likely than Northern whites to carry guns for self-protection, controlling for their risk of victimization. The difference between Southern and Northern whites is particularly strong for women. We do not find much evidence for regional/race differences in carrying knives or mace. These findings provide support for the idea that regional differences in weapon carrying reflect a gun culture rather than an honor culture. We see more evidence of an honor culture among blacks: they are more likely than whites to carry knives as well as guns, controlling for their risk of victimization."
0,"This article provides an analysis of competing frames of environmental contamination in a working class neighborhood of Buffalo, New York. Through in-depth interviewing, document analysis, and participant observation, I locate and analyze emerging frames presented from local media and government sources. I argue that the most prominent frames emerged by means of local media and government, as residents referred to these most commonly as sources for their understanding of the issues facing their community. However, the information they were most likely to portray was based on resident activist and scientific reports, respectively. I argue that these frames competed in a way that challenged mobilization efforts. How do individuals work together when they may believe entirely different frameworks as explanations of the problems they seek to resolve? Framing influences which message individuals hear, which they choose to adopt, and whether they react. In this case, two prominent frames emerging from media and government sources influence mobilization outcomes by creating community divisions and unifications, based on the source residents choose to believe."
0,"Numerous studies have shown the importance of incentives as well as of attitudes in explaining pro-environmental behavior. Reported attitude effects, however, are generally rather small and exhibit considerable variation among studies. Different theoretical perspectives can account for this finding: whereas theories of rational action suggest additive effects of costs and attitudes, the low-cost hypothesis and dual-process theories imply interaction effects - in different directions, resulting from different mechanisms. The present study tries to overcome the shortcomings of past research by using advanced statistical methods to test competitive hypotheses in the context of post-consumer waste recycling. We utilize data from a natural experiment on recycling participation in Cologne/Germany (n = 1882) in which the incentive structure for recycling changed due to the conversion of the recycling scheme from a drop-off system to curbside collection. In order to avoid self-selection bias, we conducted pre- and post-treatment surveys and applied conditional fixed-effects regression models. We found that curbside collection had a strong impact on recycling participation and attitudes had a moderate effect. The interaction is negative but statistically insignificant. Our findings contradict the low-cost hypothesis and provide some evidence that environmental concerns moderate the effect of the recycling scheme. We cannot, however, reject the rational choice proposition of mere additive effects. "
0,"How does network structure and position affect delinquent behavior?  Expanding upon research that emphasizes the importance of direct ties to friends, the current study takes a more expansive view of peer networks by focusing on the importance of a brokerage position for understanding risks of delinquent behavior.  A brokerage position is a network position that connects two or more disparate networks thus, granting the individuals who hold these positions access to, control of, and the ability to spread information among networks. Using the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1994-1995), I perform cross-sectional analyses at the individual-level, encompassing a sample of 63,460 students nested within 123 different schools.   Drawing on differential social organization theory, it is expected that individuals identified as brokers will be less delinquent than those who are not located in brokerage positions.  In addition, this study considers cohesiveness and peer delinquency within networks to determine if the effect of a brokerage position is conditioned by these structural characteristics of networks.  Findings indicate a protective effect of brokerage from delinquency that is augmented by the cohesiveness of one’s immediate peer network.  Implications of this research suggest that peer effects on adolescents’ delinquent outcomes occur beyond immediate friendship networks."
0,"How do social movements affect decisions within corporations, such as the commercialization of new technologies? We suggest that the effect of movement activism is conditioned by the internal polity and therefore, varies across organizations. This article examines how the anti-genetic movement in Germany during the 1980s affected six domestic pharmaceutical firms' commercialization of biotechnology We develop a process model of how movements penetrate the relatively closed polity of private organizations. External contestation weakened the position of internal champions of biotechnology, precipitated divisions among organizational elites, and undermined collective commitment to the technology The movement also increased perceptions of investment uncertainty but the consequences of this uncertainty depended on organizational logics of decision making. As a result, investments in some firms were tilted away from domestic biotechnology projects. The model also explains this variation in organization-level outcomes of movement contestation."
0,"A social problem that has preoccupied sociologists of gender and mental health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health."
0,"Increasing levels of democratic freedoms should, in theory, improve women's access to political positions. Yet studies demonstrate that democracy does little to improve women's legislative representation. To resolve this paradox, we investigate how variations in the democratization process-including pre-transition legacies, historical experiences with elections, the global context of transition, and post-transition democratic freedoms and quotas-affect women's representation in developing nations. We find that democratization's effect is curvilinear. Women in non-democratic regimes often have high levels of legislative representation but little real political power. When democratization occurs, women's representation initially drops, but with increasing democratic freedoms and additional elections, it increases again. The historical context of transition further moderates these effects. Prior to 1995, women's representation increased most rapidly in countries transitioning from civil strife-but only when accompanied by gender quotas. After 1995 and the Beijing Conference on Women, the effectiveness of quotas becomes more universal, with the exception of post-communist countries. In these nations, quotas continue to do little to improve women's representation. Our results, based on pooled time series analysis from 1975 to 2009, demonstrate that it is not democracy-as measured by a nation's level of democratic freedoms at a particular moment in time-but rather the democratization process that matters for women's legislative representation."
0,"The late 2000s Great Recession brought rising neighborhood poverty in the midst of affluence, and the reemer-gence of a racial and ethnic ""underclass"" living in inner-city neighborhoods. Our approach redirects attention to a level of geography-cities, suburbs, and small rural towns-where local political and economic decisions effectively exclude the poor and minority populations. It uses newly released poverty data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey to provide evidence of changing macro patterns of spatially concentrated poverty. We show that roughly one in four U.S. places had poverty rates exceeding 20 percent in 2005 through 2009, up 31 percent since 2000. Roughly 30 percent of America's poor reside in poor places, and concentrated poverty is especially high among poor African Americans. Overall increases in place-based poverty nonetheless were muted over the decade by declines in concentrated poverty among poor Hispanics (a pattern that reflects spatial diffusion to new destinations). We also show that America's poor were sorted unevenly from place-to-place within local labor markets (i.e., counties); poornonpoor segregation rates between places increased from 12.6 to 18.4 between 1990 and the 2005-2009 period. Segregation was especially high among disadvantaged blacks and Hispanics. Our empirical results make a case for more scholarly attention on newly emerging patterns of concentrated poverty at the place level."
0,"This paper examines Guatemalan and other Central American migration to the United States from the social production of space perspective to conceptualize about spatial impacts of migrants in the social environments they travel and in the areas they settle. The paper makes three main arguments based on years of research (surveys, interviews, and observations) conducted by the authors.  First, the heavily land-based migration of Guatemalans and other Central Americans has reconfigured social-spatial conditions on the expanse through which they travel, creating a migration region in which many individual, collective, and institutional activities and interests became connected, if not interlocked, with migration phenomena. Secondly, a host of organizing social actors and migrant rights advocates emerged across the expanse from Central America to North America to deal with spatial-related factors (border policies, human rights abuses at crossing points, etc.) confronting the migrant streamsthis demonstrates the transregional  (within and across national borders) social spatialization of the migration.  Thirdly, the immigration in U.S. settlement areas produces a profoundly spatially significant development as migrants establish their own spatiality and affect the surrounding socio-spatial structures of different social arenas, sometimes in contradictory ways.  For example, Guatemalan and other Central American migrants have helped U.S. domestic capital resolve the spatial restriction to foreign labor; yet, various groups have acted to restrict this labor from their communities.  The spatial dimension is lacking in much of sociological research; this paper attempts to highlight socio-spatial effects of migration for the social spaces where migrants travel."
0,"The Argentine crisis of December 2001 made evident important limitations of the neoliberal model.  With the political and economic crises, contestatory practices within civil society, some of which had been forming since the return to democracy, flourished and became widespread among large sectors of the population.  In this paper I suggest that the legacy of human rights struggles in Argentina is meaningful and critical to comprehend redefinitions of citizenship discourses and practices. I analyze the practices of human rights activism as contestations to notions of passive citizenship and as disruptions to dominant narratives of the nation fomented through the widespread adoption of neoliberal, market-driven principles throughout the 1990s.  I draw from cases of human rights organizations to discuss the significant ways in which place, culture and politics intersect in current re-significations of citizenship.  My argument focuses on  political and cultural practices developed around human rights, which have re-claimed, re-created and expanded the debates about citizenship and ultimately the democratic project."
0,"In this study, I focus on the Moroccan womens movement case to reform the Moudawana or Islamic Family Law.  I draw from the political opportunity and social movement literature to analyze the discursive means by which Conservatives and Islamists organized opposition to the feminist activists reform efforts on the basis of Islamic patriarchy. These discourses had considerable social institutional strength and cultural resonance in the Moroccan public. I demonstrate how Moroccan womens rights activists neutralized the seemingly fixed religious opposition to law reform and re-appropriated religious discourses, shaping an opportunity for the movement. This process of breaking through constraints in the political opportunity structure, I suggest denotes the permeability of constraints. I elaborate the theory of permeable constraints highlighting (a) the ways that Moroccan womens rights activists strategically re-interpreted the political opportunity structure and (b) how activists transcended religious barriers opposing Islamic law reform. The analysis finds that Moroccan activists interpretation of religious constraints as potentially permeable led them to strategize both within religious and secular frameworks, drawing from religious principles of re-interpretation through ijtihad, and international human rights principles. The activists analysis of obstacles as permeable resulted in opportunities for shifting the discourse and the tide of Moudawana reform."
0,"In her seminal work Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas (1966:160) argues, Where there is no differentiation there is no defilement.  Thus, without boundaries, we would not have any basis on which to judge, label, and stigmatize.  While generally symbolic in nature, as there is rarely a tangible line denoting where divisions lie, boundaries are fundamentally responsible for defining our social worlds, and are a necessary focus for any work exploring how we form and perceive daily interactions and stigma.   Throughout this paper I explore the boundary between fat and thin which has great consequences for those who are defined as (or define themselves as) being on the so-called wrong side of the fat line.  More specifically, I focus on what messages make fat meaningful to fat people by analyzing twenty in-depth interviews.  My findings show that both the medical community and the fashion industry are responsible for boundary drawing.  It is also clear that social processes define what is fat and what is not, and we are all, at least to some extent, vulnerable to them.  However, what particular messages affect fat people the most depends upon where they are in the life course, and their specific day-to-day experiences."
0,"For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption that old age is characterized by social isolation. However there has been no systematic, nationally representative evaluation of this possibility in terms of social network connectedness. In this article, we develop a profile of older adults' social integration with respect to nine dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary associations. We use new data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based study of non-institutionalized older Americans ages 57 to 85, conducted in 2005 to 2006 Results suggest that among older adults, age is negatively related to network size, closeness to network members, and number of non-primary-group ties. On the other hand, age is positively related to frequency of socializing with neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering. In addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of contact with network members. These findings are inconsistent with the view that old age has a universal negative influence on social connectedness. Instead, life-course factors have divergent consequences for different forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later-life transitions, such as retirement and bereavement, may prompt greater connectedness. We conclude by urging increased dialogue between social gerontological and social network research."
0,"This article reports findings from ten in-home interviews with elderly Black women. The sample was drawn from a county in Southern Maryland and included five users and five non-users of homecare services. The research is grounded in the healthicization or wellness promotion paradigm which prescribes behavioral or lifestyle changes for previously bio-medically defined events. The research is also situated within the intersection of being elderly, Black and female which not only permits the evaluation of the respondents healthcare decisions, but also allows the women to do self-analysis (research empowering participants). The interviews revealed some of the values driving the decision to practice self-care. Primarily, elderly Black women choose to practice self-care to maintain their independence, and because they believe they have a personal responsibility to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The findings raise the concern that in striving to keep up with the precepts of healthicization, elderly Black women may deny themselves necessary health services  such as homecare assistance  in order not to be perceived as health deviants."
0,"Latent class analysis (LCA) has been hailed as a promising technique for studying measurement errors in surveys, because the models produce estimates of the error rates associated with a given question. Still, the issue arises as to how accurate these error estimates are and under what circumstances they can be relied on. Skeptics argue that latent class models can understate the true error rates and at least one paper (Kreuter et al., 2008) demonstrates such underestimation empirically. We applied latent class models to data from two waves of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), focusing on a pair of similar items about abortion that are administered under different modes of data collection. The first item is administered by computer-assisted personal interviewing "
0,"I present a method for measuring aggregate religiosity. The method allows one to combine many indicators of religiosity, even if the indicators measure only a portion of religiosity, or if the indicators are not measured every year of the series. I demonstrate the method by measuring aggregate religiosity of the US population from 1952 through 2005. The results show the sharp rise in religiosity during the 1950s, the decline beginning in the 1960s, and the slower decline since the 1970s. I present evidence of content and convergent validity of this new index."
0,"Although the impact of religious affiliation on social attitudes is a popular research topic in the sociology of religion, few scholars have examined the role that race plays in this relationship. Moreover, studies that do explore the interplay of race and religious affiliation seldom move beyond the general categories of conservative, moderate, and liberal denominational families. Our research uses recent data from the General Social Surveys to compare the social attitudes of African Americans and their white counterparts within established designations of religious affiliation. Along with control variables, we include attitude measures for political tolerance, legalized abortion, gender equality, premarital sex, homosexual lifestyles, and extramarital sexual relations. Our analysis isolates levels of support for these attitudes within categories of race and religious affiliation to determine whether variations emerge and whether they are nested within specific issues, religious denominations, or reflect more general patterns of race differences."
0,"Social movement scholars have long been skeptical of culture impact on political change, perhaps for good reason, since little empirical research explicitly addresses this question. This article fills the void by examining the dynamics and the impact of the month-long 2004 same-sex wedding protest in San Francisco. We integrate insights of contentious politics approaches with social constructionist conceptions and identify three core features of cultural repertoires: contestation, intentionality, and collective identity. Our analyses, which draw on rich qualitative and quantitative data from interviews with participants and movement leaders and a random survey of participants, highlight these dimensions of cultural repertoires as well as the impact that the same-sex wedding protest had on subsequent activism. Same-sex weddings, as our multimethod analyses show, were an intentional episode of claim-making, with participants arriving with a history of activism in a variety of other social movements. Moreover relative to the question of impact, the initial protest sparked other forms of political action that ignited a statewide campaign for marriage equality in California. Our results offer powerful evidence that culture can be consequential not only internally, with implications for participant solidarity and identity, but for political change and further action as well. We conclude by discussing the specifics of our case and the broader implications for social movement scholars."
0,"Although largely ignored in the growing literature about college choice that adopts a random utility modeling frame-work, there is reason to believe that the estimates are sensitive to the criteria used to define the choice sets. Accordingly, this paper examines the methodological and substantive implications of using merit (class rank) and socioeconomic (high school strata) to define college choice sets. Using Texas as a case study, results show that criteria used to constrain choice sets-and type of high school attend in particular-not only produce quite different post-secondary institutional profiles, but also different estimates of institutional attributes on students' top choice. These findings have methodological implications for future research about college choice and substantive importance for the prospects that the Texas top 10% law, which guarantees automatic admission to students who graduate in the top decile of their high school class, will equalize access to the state's competitive public institutions.

0,"We capitalize on inter- and intra-state variation in state welfare rules regarding new immigrants to simulate a ""natural experiment"" that provides evidence on the impact of post-reform welfare (TANF) participation on immigrant women's economic self-sufficiency. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (1996-1999 and 2001-2003 panels) and textual data on state welfare rules. we examine three measures of economic well-being - employment. employment stability, and wage trajectories - to obtain a comprehensive picture of immigrants' post-welfare experiences. Findings suggest that immigrant TANF-leavers are no more or less likely to be employed than either TANF-eligible (but not receiving) or TANF-ineligible immigrant women (statistical and natural control groups, respectively). However, given employment. TANF-leavers have substantially longer spells of stable employment and steeper wage trajectories than immigrant women in both control groups. "
0,"This paper examines the background of top political office holders since WWII in Japan.  It finds greater stability and resilience in the backgrounds of high political office holders than might not comfortably fit within definitions of representative democracy, calling into question the meaning of Japanese democracy.  The movement to political office by ex-bureaucrats (seikai tenshin) and hereditary politicians (seshu giin) consistently make up a high percentage of the prime ministers, the cabinet, and elected positions among the Lower House members of the Diet, and the Liberal Democratic Party members in the Lower House. The percentage of seikai tenshin remained relatively stable, while seshu giin dramatically rose over time pointing toward a narrowing of channels to high political office.  Close to 70 percent of cabinet members and 50 percent of LDP Lower House members came through one of the two paths by the 2001 election. This pattern, showing that high political office is only open to a select few, infringes on the normative foundations of the idea of representative democracy."
0,"The development of supranational (European) social rights, and therefore social citizenship, is undermined by strong, direct relationships between citizens and national welfare states. Social policies contribute to national identities because they entail direct relationships between states and citizens. In well-developed European welfare states strong relationships between citizens and their member-states are expected. This may prevent the development of a similar relationship at the European level. The U.S. provides a comparison case, wherein a successful transference of citizenship identity from a lower to higher level has occurred, partly as a result of the building of national-level social citizenship, at least for certain classes of people. Revolutionary War Pensions provide an example of how social policy influences national identity. The lack of EU-level social policy precludes the possibility of this type of identity formation. Finally, the interplay of social citizenship and democracy in both cases is explored. T.H. Marshalls work regarding citizenship as the basis for democracy is used to understand how the inability to create a common social policy in the EU is harmful to democracy."
0,"Press and media have drawn a bleak picture that the new generation in Japan has lost its positive work ethics and no interest in joining large Japanese corporations anymore. This study analyzes whether such a generation gap in work values exists. We compared the work values of 243 pairs of university students of a prestigious university with their parents. In contrast to the general negative descriptions of press and media, results of this study indicate that no major differences in work values seem to exist between these two generations. However, gender-based value differences seem to have diminished further. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed."

Overall we find that just attending the first versus second-tier makes little difference in terms of students' class ranking, net tuition, expected wages, or likelihood of applying for graduate school. The results do show, however, that just attending the first versus second tier makes it less likely that students will get their preferred major choice. "
0,"Despite cohabitation being legally and financially equivalent to marriage, people still marry even in the most modern Western European societies. Why so? Existing theories do not provide adequate explanation of the persistence of marriage. This article argues that emotions attached to marriage, i.e. the affective evaluation of decision-makers concerning marriage, explains the persisting importance of marriage. Emotions on marriage are affected by socialization, biological and social-structural factors. We provide an exploratory test of our theoretical framework on a longitudinal study of young adults in the Netherlands. Results of our analyses are consistent with a central role of emotions in the decision to marry."
0,"Research on social movements and public policy has expanded tremendously in recent years, yet little of this work considers the role of movement opponents in the political process or how the movement-countermovement dynamic is influential in contests over policy. This historical study begins to fill this void by analyzing the contestation between employers and labor movement actors in relation to two critical right-to-work campaigns in the industrial Midwest in the 1950s. I find that actors who balance formal, professionalized organization with a more localized presence on the ground are in a better position to pursue multiple mechanisms of influence and to shape policy, while internal divisions severely limit their prospects. Event structure analyses of right-to-work campaigns advance this discussion, revealing how social movement organizational characteristics matter to the extent that they enable opposing movements to counter each others actions in unfolding political processes. I conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for perspectives on social movements and politics, and for research dealing specifically with the US. labor movement."
0,"This article analyzes the determinants of innovation and success of innovation in the field of U.S. symphony orchestras from 1879 through 1959: why did major orchestras (N = 27) innovate by introducing works of new composers to the repertoire instead of sticking to canonical pieces? Can organizational processes account for the selection and the popularization of new composers in the repertoire? By integrating field theory and organizational theory, this analysis shows that orchestra and musical director consecration and local elite cohesiveness favored innovative programming. Composers introduced by consecrated actors and entering the repertoire at a time of low competition with established composers and high field-level innovation were more likely to survive in the repertoire and have their works performed frequently. These effects became magnified throughout composers' careers."
0,"This article examines to what extent religious context influences giving to, and volunteering for religious causes-both directly and through increased attendance at religious services-and whether it has unintended spillover effects on giving and volunteering for secular purposes. Results from individuals living in a sample of counties in the United States indicate that a high level of religious pluralism is not associated with an increase in the probability that individuals will attend religious services regularly. Religious pluralism is, however directly and positively associated with religious volunteering, while the association is not statistically significant for giving. Increases in religious volunteering associated with a high level of religious pluralism do not displace secular volunteering. There is no minority effect: individuals are equally likely to give to, and volunteer for religious and secular causes whether they live in counties where their religious group represents the majority or the minority of the total population of religious adherents. As the proportion of the population in a county who is religious increases, so does the probability that any one individual will give to, and volunteer for religious causes. I do not, however find a relationship between the devoutness of a religious community and an individual propensity to give to, and volunteer for secular causes."
0,"What role do the media play in the identification and construction of white-collar crimes? Few studies have examined media coverage of corporate deviance This study investigates news coverage of six large-scale accounting scandals that broke in 2001 and 2002. Using a variety of empirical methods to analyze the 51 largest U.S. newspapers, the study tests several explanations for tendencies to run more or less coverage of the scandals in question. The study then examines the substantive focus of coverage. First, the results suggest that scandal coverage was influenced by the political ideology of newspapers, as opposed to economic interests or social structural tics between firms. Second, the analysis shows that attention to the adjudication of individual crimes and the punishment of individual offenders received the bulk of media attention."
0,"Studies of the role of religion in political outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa have characterized Mission Protestant and Catholic churches as more politicized than Muslims or Pentecostals. However, the shift to multi-party democracy, the expansion of Pentecostal/Charismatic groups across the subcontinent, and the growth of Islamic reform movements over the past 20 years are three factors that make this older characterization potentially obsolete. Further, extant literature on religion and politics in sub-Saharan Africa has been more focused on elite actions than the attitudes and opinions of citizens. In this study, we assess associations between religious identity and political engagement using 2008 Afrobarometer data from 13 countries, and analyze both individual-level and country-level co-factors. Our results show that no one religious group is more or less politically-engaged than any other, and that education, religious activity level, religious minority vs. majority status, and overseas development assistance are all important influences on how religion shapes political engagement for a given religious group in a given context."
0,"Adulthood is a taken-for-granted category in the social sciences. At the same time, the adult is the actor par excellence in the majority of research endeavors. For example, whenever youth transitions are at issue, adulthood is posited as the destination. However, the meaning of adulthood, of journeys end, is under-theorized. Recent approaches which posit the emergence of early adulthood or emerging adulthood aim at filling this conceptual lacuna, but they invariably resort to an ideal-type of adulthood that is historically specific and thus largely anachronistic. In so doing they also tend to unduly psychologize adulthood. This paper address this situation, and proposes a reconceptualization of that functions as a sociological counterweight to the emerging orthodoxy. First, the paper outline the status of adulthood as a category in social scientific and public discourse. Second, it addresses some social changes that precipitate a further problematization of adulthood. Finally, the paper elaborates a reconceptualization along recognition-theoretical lines, one that takes heed of the social transformations framing the emergent qualities of adulthood in the present."
0,"After three decades of reform, Chinas transformation of class structure stimulated the rising number of the collective actions of workers. According to the empirical evidences from two recent Chinese social surveys, I investigate three thesesmodernization model, Maoist model and social democratic modelof class consciousness and its relationship to democratization. A neo-Marxian class schema is adopted to measure the class identity and political attitude of Chinese citizens. The study discovers that the class consciousness of the Chinese citizens is transforming from the ideology of Maoism to the social democratic model, which is mainly based on their economic interests of class locations."
0,"In the study of civil society, Tocqueville-inspired research has helped illuminate important connections between associations and democracy, while corporatism has provided a robust framework for understanding officially approved civil society organizations in authoritarian regimes. Yet neither approach accounts for the experiences of ostensibly illegal grassroots nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in an authoritarian state. Drawing on fieldwork in China, I argue that grassroots NGOs can survive in an authoritarian regime when the state is fragmented and when censorship keeps information local. Moreover, grassroots NGOs survive only insofar as they refrain from democratic claims-making and address social needs that might fuel grievances against the state. For its part, the state tolerates such groups as long as particular state agents can claim credit for any good works while avoiding blame for any problems. Grassroots NGOs and an authoritarian state can thus coexist in a ""contingent symbiosis"" that-far from pointing to an inevitable democratization-allows ostensibly illegal groups to operate openly while relieving the state of some of its social welfare obligations."
0,"Reflexivity has gained paramount status in qualitative inquiry. It is central to debates on subjectivity, objectivity and, ultimately, the scientific foundation of social science knowledge and research. Although much work on doing reflexivity by researchers and practitioners has been published, scholars have only recently begun to explore how one goes about teaching reflexivity in qualitative research. To this date, no work has been directed toward teaching reflexivity in the context of qualitative interviewing. This paper first identifies challenges of teaching reflexivity. It then describes how I use existing data set and hands-on learning as complementary strategies to teach reflexivity in a course on qualitative interviewing. I conclude the paper by discussing implications of teaching reflexivity in sociology in general and qualitative research methods in particular."
0,"Urban mass mobilization often stimulates the collapse of authoritarian regimes, but the literature on social forces in democratization has not dealt adequately with these episodes of popular protest. Nor has it systematically compared democratic revolutions with cases of authoritarian crackdown and chronic quiescence, despite the prevalence of these alternative outcomes. This article critiques the democratization literature's excessive focus on class actors and economic factors by highlighting the importance of emotive appeals to nationalist and religious sentiments and solidarities in sparking, sustaining, and sanctifying high-risk protest against authoritarian governments. A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites-a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority-assume an oppositional posture. Explaining variation in mobilization outcomes thus requires examining whether communal elites have gained political salience and retained political autonomy through long-term processes of political development."
0,"We examine how the relationship between development and inequality at the societal level is perceived and evaluated by ordinary Chinese people. We hypothesize that because the Chinese have recently experienced rapid increases in both economic growth and social inequality, they tend to view economic development as a driving force of social inequality. To address this question, we conducted a social survey in 2006 in six Chinese provinces (n = 4898). The survey data reveal that a large proportion of Chinese people have internalized a causal model in which they project high levels of inequality onto countries they view as more developed and low levels of inequality onto countries they see as less developed. However, results also show that a smaller proportion of Chinese believe in a negative relationship between development and inequality. Hence, the study reveals heterogeneity among ordinary Chinese in their perceptions of the causal relationship between development and inequality. Surprisingly, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics provide no explanatory power in explaining this heterogeneity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"The academic achievement of immigrant children has been a focus of social research for decades. Yet little attention has been paid to peer social capital and its importance as a school context factor for the academic success of immigrant youths. Using multilevel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves 1 and 3), this article draws upon social capital theory and assimilation theory to examine the effects of peer social capital on the academic achievement and attainment of immigrant and native youths. The effects of three measures of peer social capital are studied, controlled for many important variables, for example, sociodemographic background variables, school characteristics, and family social capital. Results indicate that only the average GPA (grade point average) of peers had a consistent and significant effect on children's achievement and attainment, whereas the density and the homogeneity of the peer network did not. Furthermore, all three measures of peer social capital have stronger effects for immigrant youths than for native youths."
0,"Although classical sociological theory conceptualized the boundary between work and home as both coterminous with capitalism or modernity and as increasingly impermeable small businesses continue to depend on family labor and capital. A case in point is hairstyling: small businesses dominate the sector and there is significant use of family labor. Furthermore because hairstyling skills are almost universally exchangeable and can be employed in extra-work environments many hairstylists experience instances of work spilling into family life. Thus the boundary is breached in two directions. This paper conceives of the boundary between home and work as multidimensional (with core dimensions of temporality, spatiality, personnel (or social relations), tasks, and rationalities) and empirically specifies the circumstances when it is breached. It is argued that particular dimensions are reinforced or weakened where workers are in different structural positions (trainee; employee; self-employed; business-owner) and (related) where the structural organization of the workplace (the salon) varies. Additionally, the multidimensionality of the home-work boundary means that breaching across one or more dimension can coexist with ongoing ideological valorization of the boundary. Data is from the authors survey of salons and barbershops in a UK city (N=132) and semi-structured interviews with 70 stylists in 52 workplaces."
0,"Using interview data collected in 2005, this paper examines the life course trajectories of fourteen indie rock musicians from Athens, Georgia.  Almost all of the musicians believed their interest in music began at an early age.  Upon starting their bands, all musicians in my sample began to see their being a musician as central to their identities, which they framed them in gendered terms.  In their discussions of men musicians, many of my participants believed men musicians to be unique in terms of their gender identity.  A number of the men musicians thought that women musicians were less traditionally feminine than non-musician women.  However, the women musicians did not believe that their participation in a male-dominated music scene threatened their feminine gender identities.  All of the men and women musicians believed very few women participated in local bands and expressed different explanations as to why.  My preliminary data suggest that men and women musicians had a number of similar life course experiences that enabled them to pursue music in young adulthood.  These events also enabled the men and women to situate a masculine-feminine mix in constructing their gender identities."
0,"Is religion declining or growing? What are the macro and micro processes at work and how do they interact to bring about religious change over time and across the life-course? How do social-historical processes and individual-psychological processes contribute to the waxing and waning of religious authority over time? A variety of theoretical perspectives are brought to bear on these questions. Three dimensions of religiosity (religious beliefs, religious participation, and civic religiosity) are illustrated as a function of time and age using a longitudinal, multi-generational dataset. Historical effects and age are isolated by comparing trajectories of differing generations across time and age. It is hypothesized that the interactions between macro and micro level mechanisms account for the growth and decline trends of religiosity over time and across the life-course. Religious beliefs seem to vary with economic trends over time, are affected by education, and show overall slow declines over time; whereas religious participation varies across the life-course and shows a slight increase over the life-course. Civic religiosity is the aspect of religiosity most affected by family structure variables. The dynamics of believing less and participating more over time and age are an example of the complex dynamics at play in understanding religious change. These findings suggest important extensions to the secularization theory of religious change."
0,"This paper investigates the work experiences of college educated deaf women.  In a time of globalization, where do people who are seen, by some, as disabled fit or not fit into the labor force?  Using qualitative life history interviews with ten women, this study focuses on those who worked in hearing offices and in Deaf environments.  The inclusion of college educated deaf women in professional workplaces represents a shift in the American labor force since these women are among the first generation of deaf women to graduate college and obtain such jobs.  Findings include that these women often had to take personal responsibility to both obtain and keep their jobs.  By viewing themselves as part of the Deaf community and a linguistic minority, these women did not consider themselves disabled.  Similar to other minorities, they struggled to be seen as good workers.  They also had an additional struggle since they were often put in positions to be seen as legitimate workers.  They developed strategies, which include taking personal responsibility for social inclusion, using flexibility, working harder, and grappling with the double edged sword of technology.  Although technological advances helped to include them, technology also socially excluded them from their colleagues."
0,"In the context of rapidly expanding postsecondary enrollments, community colleges have the potential to play a critical and often overlooked role as a postsecondary safety net for initial four-year students who are ill prepared to successfully complete or finance their college educations. A growing proportion of the population served by community colleges engages in reverse transfer: they begin their college careers in a four-year institution but transfer to a community college prior to earning a degree. We use the National Education Longitudinal Study to examine the causes and consequences of reverse transfer for students who were expected to complete high school in 1992. Using propensity scores to control for selection into a community college, we find that the safety net function of community colleges is especially important for disadvantaged students who are significantly more likely to transfer down or drop out of higher education entirely without completing a bachelor's degree. Although reverse transfers do not fare as well as students with exclusive four-year college enrollment, they have more favorable academic and labor market outcomes than otherwise similar students who drop out of postsecondary school altogether. Community colleges may therefore lower the cost of dropping out of a four-year college."
0,"Criticizing West and Zimmermans landmark (1987) article Doing Gender, Deutsch proclaims that the introduction of symbolic interactionism into the study of gender has portrayed it as static and unchanging, leading individuals to a false sense of constraint and lacking agency. In this paper, Doing Gender is reread and defended not for implying perpetual constraint, but for showing how a symbolic interactionist study of gendered negotiations portrays constant possibilities for agency and change. Methodological propositions made by Deutsch are also addressed through examination of cases whereby individuals seek gendered agency through transgender and transsexual strategies."
0,"World polity theory is explicitly relational, implying a global network structure that exists outside of the nation-state. And world polity theory increasingly acknowledges power - that some states and regions are dominant in the international field. But current world polity measures of international nongovernmental organizations do not adequately incorporate either networks or power, leading to a mismatch between theory and measurement. In this article, we draw upon world polity, world system and social networks theories to inform the development Of a new over-time measure Of country-level connectedness to the world polity, which we label the ""INGO Network Country Score."" This measure scores countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. We compare our newly-proposed INGO Network Country Score to the traditional measure (country-level raw counts of INGO memberships) and demonstrate striking differences. Our network-based measure shows less inequality among Western countries than the traditional measure, and greater inequality between the West and the rest of the world. Looking over time, we draw three further implications from our new measure. First, there is evidence of inequality in network centrality in the world polity at all time points. Second, regional inequalities persist. Third, connections in the world polity are not exponentially increasing, as previously hypothesized. An added benefit of the analysis is our presentation of the first visual representation of country connections through INGOs."
0,"Much research on the ""digital divide"" presumes that adults who do not use the Internet are economically disadvantaged, yet little research has tested this premise. After discussing several mechanisms that might produce differences in earnings growth between workers who do and do not use the Internet, we use data from the Current Population Survey to examine the impact of Internet use on changes in earnings over 13-month intervals at the end of the ""Internet boom."" Our analyses reveal robustly signficant positive associations between Web use and earnings growth, indicating that some skills and behaviors associated with Internet use were rewarded by the labor market. Consistent with human-capital theory, current use at work had the strongest effect on earnings. In contrast to economic theory (which has led economists to focus exclusively on effects of contemporaneous workplace technology use), workers who used the Internet only at home also did better suggesting that users may have benefited from superior access to job information or from signaling effects of using a fashionable technology. The positive association between computer use and earnings appears to reflect the effect of Internet use, rather than use of computers for offline tasks. These results suggest that inequality in access to and mastery of technology is a valid concern for students of social stratification."
0,"Sarah Palin gives viable political form to a free market women’s politics that until now was largely championed by a few intellectuals and pundits based in conservative beltway think tanks. As Republicans wrestle to rebuild power in a world where women’s voter turnout is higher than men’s, their identification with the Democratic Party stronger, and the number of Republican women in office dropping, this approach slightly softens the culture war tone that is so off-putting to moderate Republicans and independents alike. This conservative women’s politics also redefines “traditional” womanhood to mean not stay at home moms but those who embrace “family values” but could well be career women or others in the workplace. Grassroots conservative defend Palin (and themselves) against Christian Right figures who promote “biblical womanhood” that demands women’s subservience to men."
0,"Previous research suggests that higher incomes, safe workplaces, job security and healthcare access all contribute to favorable health.  Although union membership is associated with all of these, its potential relationship with health has received little attention.  This study examines the association between unionization and self-rated health with the General Social Survey from the years 1973-2006.  We utilize logistic regression and propensity score matching to assess this relationship among full-time employees.  Surprisingly, initial bivariate analyses suggest that unionization is associated with worse health.  This association disappears when controlling for demographic characteristics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for employment characteristics.  In well-specified models, unionization reduces the odds of fair/poor self-rated health (relative to excellent/good) by a factor of 1.14.  The beneficial effect of being unionized is comparable to the detrimental effects of five years of aging or being divorced (as opposed to married).  We also show that unionization’s effect is largely due to the mechanism of higher incomes.  Propensity score matching analyses demonstrate that unionization has a beneficial, significant average treatment effect.  In case matched samples, unionization reduces the likelihood of fair/poor self-rated health by 14-18 percent.  Ultimately, the combination of a robust association and a clear mechanism in logistic regression along with propensity score matching evidence suggests that the effect of unionization on health is causal."
0,"Using data from two waves of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 8,054), I examine gender differences in psychological adjustment to cancer among older white adults. Results from different types of longitudinal models reveal that cancer has more adverse psychological implications for men than women. Men's higher levels of depression are reduced after adjustment for adherence to masculinity ideals of strength, independence and invincibility. Cancer poses a threat to the masculine identity because it entails lack of control over one's body and other consequences incompatible with traditional masculinity. This study contributes to sociological knowledge of the ways in which gender shapes psychological resilience and vulnerability to cancer through meanings people attach to gender roles."
0,"We use data from a nationally representative survey of adolescents in Finland to examine the effect of spending time in public settings on the risk of physical assault and robbery victimization. Our results suggest that: (1) an active night life (any time after 6 pm) has a strong effect on victimization for boys, whereas much of the association between night life and victimization is spurious for girls; (2) after school activity is not a risk factor; (3) adolescents who frequent public places at night increase their risk of victimization by people they know as well as strangers; and (4) much of the risk of night time activity in public settings is alcohol-related. Adolescents who go out at night are particularly likely to be attacked when they are drinking or when their assailant is drinking. Thus, our research suggests that a good deal of the risk associated with night time activity is a function of the victim’s own risky behavior rather than inadvertent physical contact with motivated offenders in the absence of capable guardians."
0,"Analysts have shown increased interest in how social movements use tactical repertoires strategically. While the state is most often the guarantor of new benefits, many movements-from labor to the environmental movement-target corporate, educational, and other institutions. Employing a unique data set of protests reported in the New York Times (1960-90), this research examines how repertoires are, in part, contingent on the institutional target a movement selects. In particular, the authors consider the role of each target's vulnerabilities and its capacities for response-repression, facilitation, and routinization-as explanations for the degree of transgressive protest each target faces. The results provide strong evidence for considering targets as a central factor in shaping forms of social protest."
0,"We suggest that moral panics exert spillover effects through stigma by mere association. Individuals are harmed even if their ties to stigmatized affiliates are heterophilous, and high-status individuals can also suffer. This creates a broadcast effect that increases the scale of the moral panic. Analyzing the U.S. film industry from 1945 to 1960, we examine how artists' employment in feature films was influenced by their associations with co-workers who were blacklisted as communists after working with the focal artist. Mere association reduces an artist's chances of working again, and one exposure is enough to impair work prospects. Furthermore, actors' careers are impaired when writers with whom they worked are blacklisted. Moreover, the negative effects of stigma by mere association hold even when the focal artist has received public acclaim. These findings have broad implications. When a few individuals or organizations are engaged in wrongdoing and publicly targeted, stigma by association can lead to false positives and harm many innocents."
0,"Since 2001, Afghanistan has received tremendously scholarly attention. There is an abundance of literature exploring various conceivable aspects of social and political life in the country.  One line of such literature is the topic of democratization of Afghanistan.  However, very few studies has explored the issue of people’s perception and support for democracy in Afghanistan. Even then, these studies are limited both in generalizability and the scope of their investigation.  This article asks what factors influence support for democracy in Afghanistan and how community context shapes the influence of these factors on support for democracy.  Using survey data collected by Asia Foundation in 2009, I illustrate that factors such as; political culture and how people evaluate the current political system (system evaluation) influence support for democracy in Afghanistan.  Results indicate that the impact of system evaluation and political culture are shaped by community context such as ethnic composition (i.e. whether a community is ethnically homogeneous or heterogeneous), number of literate people in the community, and whether a community is traditional or not.  The findings also have a broader theoretical implications pointing to the often-ignored role of community in shaping political attitudes and behaviour."
0,"In this paper I trace the circulatory life of ritual events in a Zapotec transborder community created by migration between Oaxaca, Mexico and Los Angeles, California. Within this community, patron saint festivals, weddings and other rituals are constituted by, and simultaneously perpetuate the exchange of material resources, the circulation of people, and visual media (e.g. photographs and video recordings of events) across borders between distant kin.  Yet in contrast to the mobile life of community members and material goods, rituals themselves are characterized by their geographical boundedness.  While some rituals are celebrated among migrants in diaspora, the most significant ritual events can only be carried out properly in the origin village, San Juan Guelavía, Oaxaca, in and among the homes of one’s progenitors.  It is precisely their locatedness that makes these events an enduringly important source of transborder community identification and belonging.  Guelavians living elsewhere must return to the village, participate in a patron saint festival, or hold a wedding ceremony, and convivir (‘live together with’), in order to enact and honor the ties of ritual kinship and reciprocal obligation that bind Guelavians together.  These dense webs of mutual obligation between family and community members are themselves created and maintained by ritual participation and the transborder exchange of money and material resources needed to carry out large-scale events.  Ritual return migration demonstrates the nexus of mobility and immobility for this community, as migratory mobility is partially oriented around geographically bound, highly local rituals, which are nevertheless shaped by mobile processes."
0,"This paper comes from a larger study of 50 Latino and Asian Americans (the racial middle) that analyzes how the experiences of the racial middle are both similar and different from those on the racial poles. Here, I explore the rhetorical strategies respondents use to minimize the racism they face. That racism often assumes their foreignnessthat they cannot speak English, and/or that they do not have lasting residential ties in the country, even if they have been here for many generations. Thus, they defiantly assert their claims to American-ness by minimizing racisms impact on their lives."
0,"Instead of maturing out of drug use, many drug users who were young adults or adolescents in the sixties and seventies are continuing drug use, or returning to drug use, in greater numbers than predicted. In addition, some older drug users (age 35 and older) are new users who started after age 30. According to national statistical data, the over age 35 age group is the fastest growing population of drug users. Yet, very little is known about aging drug users, and less is known about older adults who start illegal drugs at a late age. This study looks at survey and in-depth interviews on baby boomers who are currently using heroin and methamphetamine (the hard drugs). Using a life course perspective, we focus on evidence of a cohort and/or period effect on baby boomer drug users. Findings support earlier research on the influence of depression on drug use and show that involvement with the criminal justice system and treatment for older adult drug users is made problematic by the influence of cohort and period effects. These results add to our knowledge of aging substance abusers and provide a starting point for more research on this population."
0,We examine the relational message structure of medical interviews in the context of a probability sample of 40 medical students interviewing standardized patients (SPs).  Both relational intimacy (a.k.a. affiliation) and dominance are the two most salient and recurring features of doctor-patient interactions and have been examined extensively in the relational model traditions of interpersonal transactions.  We test the hypothesis that intimacy and dominance are orthogonally related using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).  Findings support the hypothesis in two different interview scenarios: one patient-centered by design (year 1 of medical school) and one doctor-centered by design (year 3 of medical school).  Additional CFA models test whether the three relational message types demonstrate trait-like characteristics.  Findings support a trait hypothesis for relational composure.
0,"This paper explores how processes of aestheticization in popular culture alter cognitive structures and modes of experience. The emerging strand of post-subcultural studies has thus far paid little attention to the changing forms of reflexivity and techniques of the self informing the boundary practices around youth cultural or other social identities. The paper offers a brief detour through the debates on aestheticization and prosthetic culture suggesting that the notion of aesthetic reflexivity is a useful analytical concept that helps conceptualize the complex and contradictory sensibilities cultivated in youth and popular cultures. Based on an elaboration of Schütz notion of experience, the paper sketches out how aestheticization might be construed as an intervention into the construction of reality and experience. This is followed by a more specific discussion of stylization and sensation as two significant dimensions of aestheticization in popular youth dance cultures. Both, stylization (as a subjunctive mode of acting as-if) as well as sensation (as an endocolonisation of the body) create new border zones of possible becoming. However, instead of fully dislodging the experiential paradigm of authenticity they prompt new devices for reconfiguring the boundaries of bodies, selves and identities."
0,"This paper builds on recent work on regionalism by integrating theoretical understandings of politics of scale prevalent in work by geographers. Using this analytical lens, the paper finds that in Cleveland, a city with an active, elite-led push to construct regional mechanisms of governance, regionalism is not in fact a rational solution to the region's problems but a political project to rescale governance to the advantage of the private-sector. There are other regional projects in Cleveland that have other goals in mind, but this prominent effort indicates that to understand regionalism on the ground we nned to be attentive to the particularities of regional projects. Lastly, we need to situate these scalar projects in the prior history of scalar accommodations that have been reached. In Cleveland's case, elite dissatisfaction with the rescaling of some governance functions to the scale of the neighborhood is a significant motivation for regionalism along with other factors such as competition for mobile capital."
0,"The rapid growth in cohabitation in recent decades has coincided with a burgeoning literature on the topic. Yet despite a sustained increase in cohabitation among middle-aged and older adults, this group has received little research attention. Close relationships are integral to well-being and the quality of these relationships has consequences for health, especially among older adults. We use data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of 3005 people ages 57-85 to compare the relationship quality of older cohabitors versus marrieds. The two groups are remarkably similar. Cohabitors and marrieds do not significantly differ in their reports of emotional satisfaction, pleasure, openness, time spent together, criticism, and demands. Cohabitors are less likely than marrieds to report that their relationship is very happy. There is some evidence of gender by union type differences. Cohabiting unions among older adults tend to be of relatively long duration. Overall, these results indicate that cohabitation may operate as an alternative to marriage for older adults. "
0,"For Koreans living abroad, a move to South Korea represents a homecoming of sorts, a psychic return to the country of ones ancestry, romanticized and distant. This paper explores the migration projects of Korean Americans and Korean Chinese (Joseonjok) to Seoul, South Korea in search of an ideal Koreanness, embodied in a specific history, culture and tradition. This paper addresses how return migration flows challenge the authenticity of these ethnic identities internalized by diasporic Korean communities. These return migrants are perceived as both foreign yet familiar which informs their positions within Korean society in distinct ways.  Using semi-structure interviews and participant observation during a 16-month fieldwork period in Seoul, South Korea, this paper focuses specifically on state policies concerning the rights and privileges of foreign migrant workers, whose shared ethnic ancestry blur the line between foreign and citizen. The thread throughout the interviews is the struggle of cultural hybridity and belonging, of inhabiting a liminal space between two distinct national identities but linked through a sense of shared ethnic identity. The research contributes to a larger dialogue on the nature of transnational ethnic identities in the 21st century and how immigrant groups construct new cultural forms through their experiences in the homeland."
0,"There is widespread interest in understanding anti-Muslim prejudice in Europe, but there is little systematic evidence about the extent and patterns of the prejudice. Using data from the 1999-2000 wave of European Values Study this article examines the extent and determinants of anti-Muslim prejudice in both Western and Eastern Europe. We find that prejudice against Muslims was more widespread than prejudice against other immigrants, and that the effects of individual and country-level predictors of prejudice resemble those found in research on anti-minority prejudice in general. Fairly similar results were obtained for both Eastern and Western Europe, but the aggregate levels of prejudice are higher in the East. Our results imply that Muslims in Europe were particularly prone to becoming targets of prejudice, even before the attacks of September 11. The results give some support to group-conflict theory, mainly with regard to the effects of the unemployment. However, the size of Muslim population in a country does not seem to increase the level of anti-Muslim prejudice. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"The antecedents of group-level innovation performance and the consequences of inter-personal trust have been comprehensively explored. However, the linkage between trust and innovation has received little attention. This status quo is partly because the main stream in innovation research has ignored the role of inter-personal interaction in innovation process and, at the same time, trust research has suffered from unrealistic assumptions that lead to weak predict power. Focused on the people involved in innovation project (i.e., group members and leader), this study explores the impact of group members trust in colleagues, group members trust in leader, and leaders trust in group members on group-level performance of innovation generation. The symmetry assumption of inter-personal trust is partly relaxed. By importing two important and related variables, namely, motivation to cooperate and monitoring, a detailed model is given. Research methods for future test and the contribution are discussed."
0,"Historically, the hip hop subculture has been a medium for African Americans to express their collective identity as an underrepresented and marginalized group within the United States and its institutions. For scholars and non-scholars alike, the growing presence of young white males within this subculture is a puzzling cultural event. This honors thesis examines the participation of white male youths in the subculture of hip hop. The primary focus of the study is on why these white youth seek to become members. Although the discourse of white males in hip hop is varied, this study challenges the existing discourse with empirical evidence and argues that class, race, and gender are fundamental to their presence in hip hop."
0,"AKPs conservative democracy aims to transcend Kemalist secularism, not by inverting it as if in a mirror image, as was the case with the political Islamist project of instituting a new cultural regime from above, but by instituting a liberal pluralism. Rejecting models imposed from above, it aims to accommodate the cultural identity of the Turkish people in a new concept of liberal democracy. This makes Turkey a model of democracy for the Muslim world in a way that it has not been before. Previously, Turkey was presented as a model not because its Islamic culture and identity were valued, but because they were suppressed. Islam and democracy were deemed incompatible by the Turkish secular establishment that followed Western assumptions. Hence it was because of its top-down secularization experience that Turkey was presented as an exception in the Muslim world. Now for the first time in Turkish history we see a group of leaders who are not political Islamists, yet who also do not hide their Muslim identity while they are pursuing the establishment of a genuine liberal democracy. The Turkish experience can become a real antidote to the dreaded clash of civilizations."
0,"Genetics research on autism has been an emerging topic of interest for both public and private stakeholders, creating an unprecedented amount of resources available to conduct autism genetics research. Despite the growing social and scientific investments in autism genetics, the production, representations and implications of the genetic knowledge of autism are not well understood. The representations of autism genetics through technoscientific research could have a profound influence on how autism is defined, treated, and ‘imagined’ in the future. Based on interviews with a range of scientists who conduct autism genetics research and the implementation of grounded theory methods, this paper will discuss the production of genetic knowledge within the social world of autism genetics. It will specifically describe the historical transformations in autism genetics research, the research challenges in autism that are prompting new genetically constructed meanings of autism, and insights to the knowledge producing technologies that are shifting the genetic disease paradigm from inherited single gene causing mutations to rare genetic variants that are spontaneously acquired. In closing, this paper will analyze how scientists are imagining the future of autism through their research and constructing autism as a genetic disease."
0,"We investigate how 30 pediatricians and pediatric oncologists who practice and teach at elite medical centers determine whether religion and spirituality are relevant to what Andrew Abbot (1988) calls their professional ""jurisdictions."" Through in-depth interviews we focus on their everyday interactions with patients and families. We ask: (1) How do they gather information about religion and spirituality and determine when that information is relevant to their professional work? (2) Do they perceive religion and spirituality to be a barrier or a bridge to medical care as they do what Thomas Gieryn (1983) calls ""boundary work""? We find that pediatric oncologists more than pediatricians see religion and spirituality as relevant to their professional work, though still largely outside their professional jurisdiction. It is most relevant when families are making medical decisions and in end of life situations. Physicians tend to view religion and spirituality functionally, describing impermeable boundaries in medical decision making situations and more permeable boundaries at the end of life. Physicians view religion and spirituality as a barrier when it impedes medical recommendations and as a bridge when it helps families answer questions medicine inherently cannot. Such findings have implications for a wide range of professionals as they negotiate their jurisdictions, particularly around religion and spirituality, in everyday practice."
0,"While police levels may affect crime, governments may react to crime by increasing police levels. The instrumental variables (IV) approach to this problem has proven difficult due to the problem of locating instruments for police levels. Using panel data from over 5000 cities (1990-2001), we instrumented police levels with two types of federal law enforcement grants, thus yielding over-identified models. We also subjected our instruments to both relevance and validity testing, a step authors of similar studies have yet to take. We found fairly robust inverse associations between police levels and four index crime rates (homicide, robbery, assault, and burglary), but mainly in large cities. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Abundant research investigates the content of public discourse about social problems. Far less is known about the quantity of social problems discourse. This article employs original data to address this gap by examining the emergence of single-parent families as a social problem within U.S. popular magazines and social science journals. I trace the growth of discourse about single-parent families in magazines indexed by the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature (N = 3050) and social science journals indexed by JSTOR (N = 1376) between 1900 and 1998 and explore factors associated with this growth. The results indicate that contemporary issues functioned as rival social problems and depressed single-parent family discourse within magazines but not within journals. Increases in the prevalence of single-parent families were associated with increases in related discourse in both arenas, but discourse increased earlier in journals. Growing popular concern about single-parent family formation in the 1960s was associated with a reduction in the quantity of single-parent family discourse within journals but not within magazines."
0,"This paper explores how Colorado, which accepted 4000 evacuees from the Gulf Coast following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, provided services through public and private agencies and the challenges that arose. Housing southern Blacks presented several challenges for state and voluntary organization officials unaccustomed to many of the cultural differences from the region as well as the deep distrust of official efforts to assist them. These agencies adapted their practice in significant ways. Using interview data with evacuees, service providers, agency leaders, and government officials, we examine which culturally and racially-based challenges arose and how agencies aimed to mitigate them. First, relief agencies modified food service, including the use of ingredients and recipes to make meals more familiar to clients. Second, members of multi-racial and predominantly African American churches began volunteering to provide human contact and spiritual uplift for evacuees. Third, Colorado mobilized a multi-racial coalition of churches, victims assistance programs, local chapters of national charities, and the counties in which those affected settled. In this paper, we examine the complicated issues that arise as private agencies determine eligibility for services or moral worthiness in ways not permitted by state agents. Private organizationsboth religious and secularhave long been relied upon as a source of relief in disasters. In this case, the official delegation of short-term relief and long-term recovery to local churches provides opportunity to examine the limits of the state as well as the strengths and limits of volunteerism, particularly as they are deployed to manage racially charged interactions."
0,"Income inequality has been increasing in the United States, and intraoccupational processes are partly responsible (Kim and Sakamoto 2008; Mouw and Kalleberg 2010). To date, scholars have focused on suboccupational divisions, such as specialty areas, to understand why some members of an occupation earn more than others. In this article we theorize, operationalize, and assess the economic effect of another way in which members of the same profession can be distinguished: by the extent to which they specialize. Using two large secondary datasets on lawyers in the United States, we find that lawyers who specialize earn more. This effect arises partly through two mechanisms-individual productivity and firm size-and depends upon specialty area prestige: lawyers in low-prestige areas actually benefit more from specializing."

Each of these works point to models that focus on different paths/plans to explain the growth and decline of variables. The theoretical implications of these models are compared."
0,"Using 2006 General Social Survey data, the authors compare levels of segregation by race and along other dimensions of potential social cleavage in the contemporary United States. Americans are not as isolated as the most extreme recent estimates suggest. However, hopes that ""bridging"" social capital is more common in broader acquaintanceship networks than in core networks are not supported. Instead, the entire acquaintanceship network is perceived by Americans to be about as segregated as the much smaller network of close ties. People do not always know the religiosity, political ideology, family behaviors, or socioeconomic status of their acquaintances, but perceived social divisions on these dimensions are high, sometimes rivaling racial segregation in acquaintanceship networks. The major challenge to social integration today comes from the tendency of many Americans to isolate themselves from others who differ on race, political ideology, level of religiosity, and other salient aspects of social identity."
0,"The self-reported health question summarizes information about health status across several domains of health and is widely used to measure health because it predicts mortality well. We examine whether interactional behaviors produced by respondents and interviewers during the self-reported health question-answer sequence reflect complexities in the respondent's health history. We observed more problematic interactional behaviors during question-answer sequences in which respondents reported worse health. Furthermore, these behaviors were more likely to occur when there were inconsistencies in the respondent's health history, even after controlling for the respondent's answer to the self-reported health question, cognitive ability, and sociodemographic characteristics. We also found that among respondents who reported ""excellent"" health, and to a lesser extent among those who reported their health was ""very good,"" problematic interactional behaviors were associated with health inconsistencies. Overall, we find evidence that the interactional behaviors exhibited during the question-answer sequence are associated with the respondent's health status. "
0,"Using unique data on employers pre-hire preferences, this article examines the effect of sex typing on the gender gap in offered wages and training. Previous studies using post-hire data have not been able to focus directly on the effects of employer behavior, distinct from employee preferences. By analyzing gender-designated job requisitions for the entry-level labor market in a Japanese city, this study investigates employers' pre-hire decisions about the wage level and on-the-job training that accompany the sex typing of jobs. Results show that employers' sex typing excludes women in advance from jobs that provide higher wages and longer training."
0,"This research attempts to uncover when the black-white test score gap begins and why it exists by examining a nationally representative sample of infants using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. The findings demonstrate that there is a small raw gap in cognitive skills between the infants of white and black mothers in the United States. However, through structural equation modeling, results show that when one controls for social, human, and financial capital and for differences in health and type of child care, the infants of African American mothers would score higher than the infants of white mothers because of their precocious motor development. Social capital and low birth weight are found to be key mediators of the small black-white test score gap in infancy."
0,"Rural U. S. poverty rates have been persistently high. Market-based anti-poverty strategies, specifically microenterprise programs, have gained currency as a feasible avenue for moving women out of poverty. While rural women may share some commonality, homogeneity among rural women is often assumed in poverty scholarship. It is imperative that poverty scholars contribute to closing the gap between theoretical explanations and the actually experiences of poverty among individuals occupying different social locations. As researchers address this gap, this article argues for the value of integrating two important components consistent with black feminist epistemology: (1) an intersectionality perspective, and (2) the voices of the local actors/stakeholders. This article concludes that without a purposeful examination of individuals located at the intersection of race/ethnicity, gender, and/or class; even carefully formulated policy can inadvertently discriminate against or benefit some women more than others."
0,"Despite Civil Rights legislation, racial inequality persists, especially in the context of poverty. This study advances the literature on racial inequality and the Southern legacy of slavery by examining slavery's relationship with inequality in poverty. I analyze county-level U.S. Census data using regression and spatial data analysis techniques. I find the 1860 slave concentration is related to contemporary black-white inequality in poverty, independent of contemporary demographic and economic conditions, racialized wealth disparities and racial threat. My research suggests the importance of slavery for shaping existing U.S. racial inequality patterns. Insights derived from this research, including the formulation of legacy as a place-based, continuous phenomenon that is distinct from racial threat, provide the basis for future research on legacy's mechanisms."
0,"This study builds on research demonstrating that sub-regions within the United States have different processes that abet poverty and that child poverty is spatially differentiated. We focus on the social attributes of the local area to assess what the geographic place represents in terms of social characteristics, namely racial/ethnic composition and economic structure, and to resolve apparent inconsistencies in poverty research. Using spatial regime and spatial error regression techniques to analyze county census data, we examine spatial differentiation in the relationships that generate child poverty. Our approach addresses the conceptual and technical aspects of spatial inequality. Results show that local-area processes are at play with implications for more nuanced theoretical models and anti-poverty policies that consider systematic differences in factors contributing to child poverty according to the racial/ethnic and economic contexts.

0,"We investigate how participants in the street economy of crack cocaine construct a ""hustler"" identity by contrasting their social behaviors and styles with a dialectically contrastive crackhead identity. For those who are proximate to, or involved in, the crack cocaine economy, effort is required to avoid being labeled a crackhead. Would-be hustlers construct boundaries that separate them from others on the street through talk and behavior. We draw on interviews conducted with 28 men convicted of committing violent street crimes to explore how they distance themselves from those exhibiting distasteful symptoms of crack addiction. By examining the boundaries between these two street-based identities we increase sociological understanding of the significance of offenders' identity work for shaping their conceptions of self and other, as well as their interactions in everyday street life."
0,"An unprecedented number of Americans began investing at the end of the last century, yet little is known about the probable impact of this new socio-economic force. The present study explores this question through observation and interviews with amateur investors, seeking to understand how they view publicly-traded firms and their relationship to them as shareholders. The goal will be to identify and analyze the forces likely to be significant for firms in the coming years, by examining investors' expectations. The data suggest that corporate ethics and identity will increase in importance, as shareholders demand that the firms in which they invest reflect and enhance their self-concepts. Participants in this study experienced conflicts between their burgeoning identity as investors and their self-concepts in terms of ethics and gender. Thus, they make choices among firms based not only on expected economic returns, but also on the consistency of a firm's identity with their own self-image, as men, women and moral people. Corporate social responsibility and ethical practices are part of a larger set of expectations held by this new group of investors."
0,"The deleterious health consequences of job insecurity may depend on two factors: the duration of job insecurity, and life-course timing. Drawing from Mirowsky and Ross’ (2001) research on temporal changes in economic hardship, we consider whether the effect of job insecurity on well-being depends on whether the experience is persistent, new or recently resolved. Additionally, we argue that age is a key social status that defines perceptions and experiences of job insecurity and subsequent health disparities. Using panel data from the Work, Stress and Health study, we examine the health effects of temporal changes in perceived job insecurity across age groups over two waves of interviews with 1,257 American workers. Analyses reveal that in comparison to perceived job stability, persistent insecurity is associated with a decline in several health outcomes—though these patterns are contingent on age. Persistent insecurity leads to a decrease in general health over time, but only among older workers. Additionally, persistent insecurity increases feelings of anxiety and this effect is stronger for older workers, while it is associated with an increase in depression among all workers. Our findings advance knowledge on the health effects of job insecurity as a chronic stressor, and the ways that these effects are contingent on age."
0,"This study investigates the manner in which people in a multicultural urban setting utilize and interpret cultural objects as part of their boundary-work project. It examines the conditions under which the interpretive use of such objects has the potential of demarcating social groups from one another and, at the same time, of providing common ground for social cohesion and identification among all members of the local social whole. Drawing on Wendy Griswolds (1987a, 1987b, 1994) analytical model, this article suggests that only cultural objects that are characterized as weak in cultural power are capable of maintaining internal social boundaries and, at the same time, of acting as a mechanism for a symbolic crossing of these boundaries. This study illuminates the cultural process of boundaries formation and regulation through an examination of the particular case of various Jewish communities in Jerusalem and their uses of the local newspaper of Kol HaIr."
0,"To what extent does community context affect individuals' social ties and levels of community attachment? The authors replicate Sampson's multilevel version of Kasarda and Janowitz's systemic model of community using data from a survey of nearly 10,000 people residing in 99 small Iowa communities. They improve on Sampson's work by using multilevel statistical tools, better measurement of community attachment, and data from 99 actual communities. While the authors find general support for the systemic model, their results suggest that the community one lives in actually has little effect on one's level of community attachment, calling into question many of the basic assumptions and findings of past community research."
0,"Faced with high uncertainty how do producers in the cultural economy make creative decisions? We present a case study of the fashion modeling industry. Using participant observation, interviews and network analysis of the Spring/Summer 2007 Fashion Week collecdons, we explain how producers select models for fashion shows. While fashion producers conceive of their selection of models as a matter of ""taste,"" or personal preference, we find that their decisions are shaped by information sharing mechanism,,; in social networks, principally through a mechanism known as ""optioning,"" which enables producers to know each others' preferences and to align themselves with similar status actors. For cultural producers, choices are a matter of strategic status considerations, even as they are expressed as a matter of personal taste."
0,"Robert Putnams Bowling Alone (2000) and the work on social capital it influenced has largely ignored subjective measures of social well-being, such as happiness and life satisfaction, and has instead focused on the effects of social capital on objective measures of social well-being, such as education, health, and crime.  Further, no research has explored the effects of social capital on domain-specific dimension of subjective well-being.  Addressing this absence in the literature, our research explores the effects of social capital on overall life satisfaction and two domain-specific subjective indicators of well-being: neighborhood satisfaction and community satisfaction. Using data from the Detroit Metropolitan Area from 1975 and 2001, we test Putnams assumption that social capital is vital to subjective well-being.  In our analyses we (1) document trends in both social capital and quality of life in the Detroit area between 1975 and 2001, and (2) evaluate the impacts of social capital measures on overall life satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, and community satisfaction in both 1975 and 2001.  The poster concludes with implications for the social capital research agenda and urban social policy."
0,"Faced with declining fertility rates, media in Britain are reacting with anxiety about cultural annihilation. To look at the nationalist intersection of concerns over biological and cultural reproduction, this article analyzes coverage of falling fertility and rising immigration in Great Britain in major newspapers in 2000-2. I find pronatalist appeals to be common and especially directed at women.  These appeals, characterized as begging, lecturing, threatening and bribing, express different relationships between individual interest and the national good and offer both positive and negative views of women. The political leanings of specific newspapers also affect how they connect biological reproduction to the cultural threat seen in immigration. Finally, I discuss the feasibility of using pronatalist frames to achieve feminist political goals."
0,"Mainland Chinese elders constitute a unique group in popular Christian participation and conversion. This work aims to explore the social contexts and cultural facets of Mainland Chinese elders' Christian practice in the United States. Based on face-to-face, in-depth interviews with 20 Mainland Chinese elders as well as participant observation at selected congregational settings, this study suggests that the existing theories on aging and religion as well as religious practice among immigrants are inadequate to explain Chinese elderly immigrants' participation in Christian congregations in the U.S. Instead, social isolation and lack of social support system resulting from immigration and aging process serve as the major drive for the elders to pursue social and cultural recognition from Chinese Christian gatherings. Besides religious services, social service functions of churches and opportunities for fellowship are other factors that explain Chinese elders' church involvement. In conclusion, we argue that social and cultural services are needed to particularly assist Chinese seniors to adjust and adapt to their elderly lives in the host country."
0,"When do work organizations hire more women?  Prior research suggests that economic pressure and a gendered organizational structure may influence employers’ decision to hire women, but few studies have examined how employers change hiring behavior as they try to incorporate economic pressure in a sex-segregated workplace.  In this paper, I investigate employers’ hiring behavior by analyzing the annual hiring outcomes by gender for full-time white-collar entry-level jobs across 2,015 large Japanese companies from 1998 to 2008.  Using Japan in this period as my empirical case provides me with great analytical leverage to examine how employers change their hiring behavior in response to changing economic conditions and the pre-existing gendered organizational structure.  During this period, large Japanese companies went through various kinds of organization-level restructuring and realignment in order to incorporate with the elongated recession and the revised Equal Employment Opportunity Law, which forced them to change their sex-segregated hiring and work system.  I find that opportunities for women relative to men are higher when the company is facing tough economic conditions.  Upon closer analysis, I find that this increase in women’s opportunity is limited to lower-ladder (non-promotional) jobs.  In this period, employers expanded their hiring of female labor only when they had a specific, gendered category in which they could place women.  The irony of women’s progress is that the ratio of women to men improves under tough economic conditions only when a company has a pre-existing sex-segregated system."
0,"How are patterns of work and work exit related to family roles, caregiving, health, and socioeconomic status? Using a life course framework, we investigate antecedents to the work trajectories of white men and women in their 50s and 60s who participated in the1993 and 2004 waves of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). We focus on family roles (marital status, parent status), caregiving responsibilities, health, and social status. We find evidence for gender-specific effects of family roles and responsibilities on patterns of work in the midcourse years, showing the importance of linked lives for multiple domains of life."
0,"Cigarettes appeal to many adolescents because they signal the possession of hard-to-observe, desirable attributes such as maturity and toughness.  To directly counteract cigarette advertisements, which are responsible for the positive images associated with cigarettes, a negative signaling strategy is proposed; i.e., potential smokers and potential quitters should be informed that smoking cigarettes signals the possession of hard-to-observe, undesirable attributes.  I propose several such undesirable attributes, but focus on low intelligence.  In a sample of U.S. adolescents aged 12 to 16 in 1997, a conservative estimate places the mean IQ of daily smokers 10 percentiles lower than that of those who have never smoked.  The relationship is strongest for non-Hispanic Whites; the mean IQ of White daily smokers is approximately 18 percentiles lower than that of their White peers who have never smoked.  The mere dissemination of these facts may discourage smoking."
0,"Results from a recent web survey of young women that examines perceptions of discrimination in science classrooms are used to show the value of the vignette method for researchers using new technologies. The vignette findings suggest that a majority of young African American women see race and gender barriers in the science classroom. Although African American women see race as a more formidable barrier than gender, they are more likely than white women to see gender barriers as well. Results reveal advantages of the vignette method for gaining detail and control in the context of the social survey. It is argued that the combination of web survey technology and vignette methodology has considerable potential for providing substantive insights in social science research."

0,"In this article we use comparative micro data for 15 European countries covering the period 1992-2007 to study the impact of labor market reforms on the skill-related individual risk of holding a temporary contract and the risk of being unemployed. Our results indicate no general increase in either of these skill gaps. Using two-step multilevel analyses, we show that in the case of high protection of regular contracts, lowering restrictions on the use of temporary contracts increases the relative temporary employment rates of low-skilled workers. However, this kind of partial deregulation, which has been implemented in the majority of Western European countries, has not translated into decreasing unemployment risks of the low-skilled vis-a-vis medium- and highly-skilled persons."
0,"The National Science Foundation is sponsoring the establishment of a research ethics program for doctoral students studying at land grant universities in the United States.  In this research ethics program, doctoral students enroll in a general research ethics course and participate in subject-specific research ethics modules.  In this paper, we outline a module to educate students about research ethics in the field of sociology.  First, we overview differences between the social sciences and the natural sciences. Then we discuss ways to engage in sociological research.  After this, we introduce ethical standards, issues, and sanctions in sociology.  Finally, we emphasize the inherent ambiguity of research ethics in sociology by presenting a case study, critiquing the case study, and then posing questions for further discussion."
0,"It is well known that some colleges and universities require higher mathematics and reading scores for admittance than other colleges and universities.  The present paper examines the influence of mathematics and readings scores on the type of college attended using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.  The analysis uses test scores taken when students were seniors in high school to predict type of college attended as measured by the Carnegie Basic Classification of colleges.  The results show a clear ordering of universities with research very high  private being more likely to be selected by students with higher mathematics and reading scores.  At the bottom were seven types of universities, capturing 32 percent of respondents, where mathematics and reading scores did not differentiate chances of attending one type from the other.  In addition, students with higher mathematics or reading scores were generally more likely to attend other categories of college and universities than these seven categories."
0,"Drawing on original qualitative research, this article investigates how natives and institutions in rural America ""new immigrant destinations"" are adapting, if at all, to Hispanic newcomers and whether corresponding interaction should be viewed as substantively responsive. In contrast to predictions made by traditional political incorporation theories, results based on semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork suggest that Hispanic newcomers are undergoing a process of bureaucratic incorporation whereby public service bureaucrats, rather than elected politicians, are initiating substantive responsiveness. Yet I also identify a continuing interaction between immigrant bureaucratic and political incorporation in rural America. I conclude by connecting my findings to more general sociological perspectives regarding population needs, electoral bodies, and public bureaucracies in democratic societies."
0,"In a departure from most studies of the causes of racial residential segregation that focus on the three main factors of economics, preferences, and discrimination, this paper examines one of the mechanisms through which segregation may be perpetuated: the housing search process itself. Data come from a 2004 face-to-face survey of an area probability sample of African American and white householders living in the three counties of the Detroit metropolitan area (n = 734). These data are used to address three research questions: (1) What are the strategies people use to find housing, and are there racial differences in those strategies? (2) Do whites and African Americans report similar or different experiences in the search for housing? (3) Do the locations in which people search for housing vary by race? Results show that once controlling for the type of search and background characteristics, the search strategies are generally similar for whites and blacks, though more so for buyers than renters: for example, black renters use more informal strategies and networks than do white renters. Analyses that look at the features of these strategies, however, reveal some significant racial differences. Search experiences are similar in terms of length and number of homes inspected, but other objective and subjective questions about the search show blacks at a disadvantage compared to whites: African Americans submit more offers/applications for homes, report more difficulties, and are much more likely to feel they were taken advantage of during the search. The racial characteristics of the communities in which blacks and whites search are quite different: whites mainly search in white communities, while African Americans search in communities with a variety of racial compositions. The paper concludes with a call for further research on housing search strategies, with particular attention to the role of social networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Based on 36 in-depth interviews conducted with 18 Japanese couples who live in Southern California, this study examines the impact of differential economic opportunities on the division of labor among Japanese immigrant couples. Three main factors facilitate Japanese professional and businessmen's mobility to and settlement in Southern California: (1) the gender-based stratification of the workplace in Japan; (2) U.S. immigration policies that favor foreign nationals with strong corporate ties and business experience; and (3) the strong presence of Japanese corporations in Southern California. Whereas these conditions enable men to maintain their earning power, they do not benefit women in employment opportunities. The difference in economic opportunities encourages Japanese couples to preserve a breadwinner and homemaker division of labor, and women continue to do a bulk of housework and childcare even when women reenter the labor force later in their lives."
0,"Historically, African Americans and white girls have not had the same access to playing sports as white boys have had. Changes in laws led to racial integration of sports teams and equal athletic opportunities for girls. Yet, racial and gender gaps in playing sports persist, and intersections between race and gender, as well as different contexts of participation, may contribute to the gaps. This article uses structural resource and racial competition theories to examine the interactions among race, gender, and school environment to determine whether racial gaps persist for boys and girls and whether individual and school-level factors account for gender-specific racial gaps in sports participation. We combine data on every ninth-grade student in North Carolina public schools with data from school yearbooks and find that racial gaps in playing sports differ by gender, and that school factors-including opportunities schools provide to play sports-have unique influences on racial gaps for boys and girls."
0,"The rapid rise of China and India necessitates discussion of the common, generally-accepted practice of using the state as the unit of analysis in cross-national research.  These two states are not only populous and spatially enormous, but also internally diverse.  India has no less than 23 official languages.  In China, the median income of urban residents is almost three times greater than that of rural residents.  This paper will examine the concepts of state, nation, and region as they pertain to comparative sociology.   Vital population statistics and economic measures will be examined at each level to explore whether these countries, given their size and diversity, should more aptly be compared to regions, such as Europe.  Finally, with the rise of transnational governance organizations, these areas are becoming more similar politically."
0,"Counts of offenses known to the police, arrests, and victimizations have frequently been used as if they were interchangeable. The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), with its provision of offense, victim, offender, and arrest counts lets us examine the relationship of social and economic factors to each of these crime measures. In simple terms, we are asking, Does the crime measure we use have a substantial impact on our results and on our interpretation of them?  Using NIBRS 2002 and census 2000 data for three sets of cities to examine the importance of unemployment, income, racial composition, and family structure for four different race- and sex-specific measures of crime, we find that the offense rate, not to be confused with the offender rate, is predicted by city size and the relative size of the black population. However, black male robbery arrest and offender rates are predicted by black per-capita income and city size. Black murder offender rates are predicted by the percentage of black households with a female householder and no husband present. In general, using arrest or offender rates clarifies the relationships shown for non-specific offense rates."
0,"While efforts to criminalize spousal rape began in the 1970s, by 2002 only twenty-three states had adopted laws that allow for the full prosecution of sexual assault by a spouse. The authors present the first analysis of martial rape law reform to incorporate insights from research on diffusion. The authors find that states are more likely to criminalize spousal rape when women in the state have more economic power. Conversely, states are less likely to criminalize spousal rape when the legislature passed previous incremental reforms or when a neighboring state already criminalized spousal rape. The authors also find that states that criminalize spousal rape under a split-party government are particularly influential in the spread of such reforms and that the processes driving early diffusion are different than the processes driving later diffusion. Overall, results suggest that understanding law reforms requires greater attention to incremental change, negative effects of spatial diffusion, and the importance of time."
0,"This project employs a moral solidarity framework to explore the relationship between organized religion and lynching in the American South. The authors ask whether a county's religious composition affected its rate of lynching, net of demographic and economic controls. The authors find evidence for the solidarity thesis, using three religious metrics. First, their findings show that counties with greater religious diversity experienced more lynching, supporting the notion that a pluralistic religious marketplace with competing religious denominations weakened the bonds of a cohesive moral community and might have enhanced white racial solidarity. Second, counties in which a larger share of the black population worshipped in churches controlled by blacks experienced higher levels of racial violence, indicating a threat to intergroup racially based solidarity. Finally, the authors find a lower incidence of lynching in counties where a larger share of church members belonged to racially mixed denominations, suggesting that cross-racial solidarity served to reduce racial violence."
0,"During the past 50 years, a consensus has been forming around Edward Westermarck's idea that incest avoidance results from an aversion that develops when individuals are brought up in propinquity. The argument here presented counters this emerging consensus. Reexamining the case of the Israeli kibbutzim, the authors show that individuals who grew up in the kibbutzim's communal education system were in fact often attracted to their peers, and only rarely did they develop sexual aversion toward these peers. This article offers an alternative explanation to the problem of incest avoidance and the incest taboo, one that brings sociological factors back into the picture."
0,"The educational expectations of 10th-graders have dramatically increased from 1980 to 2002. Their rise is attributable in part to the changing educational composition of students' parents and related to the educational profiles of their expected occupations. Students whose parents have gone to college are more likely to attend college themselves, and students expect occupations that are more prestigious in 2002 than in 1980. The educational requirements of particular occupation categories have risen only slightly. These analyses also reveal that educational expectations in recent cohorts are more loosely linked to social background and occupational plans than they were in 1980. The declining importance of parents' background and the decoupling of educational and occupational plans, in addition to a strong and significant effect of cohort on educational expectations, suggest that the expectation of four-year college attainment is indeed becoming the norm.

0,"Using children of immigrants sample from National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study investigates how immigrant youth acculturating to the American social norm of volunteering and how the acculturation is modified by living in immigrant neighborhoods Multilevel logistic regression produces distinct patterns for children living in high-SES and low-SES neighborhoods In high-SES neighborhoods, being among foreign-born residents serves as a buffer against acculturating to the social norm for youth, and this buffer has an enduring impact when they enter Into their early adulthood Conversely, in low-SES neighborhoods, acculturating to this social norm is irrelevant to the proportion of foreign-born residents in their neighborhoods However, the experience of growing up in such neighborhoods has the potential to enhance the acculturation to volunteering when the adolescents enter into young adulthood The findings shed new light on segmented assimilation theory that is, being among the foreign-born not only could prevent immigrant youth from downward assimilation, but also could restrict acculturation to positive social norms"
0,"The study employs survey data from rural Mozambique to examine how men's labor migration affects their non-migrating wives' perceptions of HIV/AIDS risks. Using a conceptual framework centered on tradeoffs between economic security and health risks that men's migration entails for their left-behind wives, it compares women married to migrants and those married to non-migrants while also distinguishing between economically successful and unsuccessful migration. The analysis finds that the economic success of men's migration, rather than migration itself, significantly predicts women's worries about getting infected by their husbands or their own extramarital partners, and their husbands' stance on condom use. These findings are situated within a broader context of socio-economic, gender, and marital dynamics and vulnerabilities produced or amplified by male labor migration in sub-Saharan and similar developing settings."
0,"This paper reports preliminary findings from a 14year prospective study of 518 single mothers and 502 married mothers who were initially interviewed in 1992-3, again in 1994-5, and for a third time in 2005-7.  We explore how different patterns of transitions into and out of single parenthood over this 14-year period affect current levels of distress among these women.  We also examine the roles that significant adversities in childhood and adolescence play in modifying these trajectories.  Implications for the life course perspective on mental health are discussed."
0,"This research compares four international framework agreements (IFAs) in different national-industrial contexts in an effort to assess the varied ways they are implemented locally. Although IFAs are regularly viewed as static contracts with universal applicability, this study views them as instruments that local workers and unions can use in different ways depending on the local circumstances. In so doing, unlike the recent surge of interest in IFAs as a transnational mechanism, we focus here on the local as a bellwether for evaluating global unionism.  It compares outcomes of implementation among unions in South Africa, India, Brazil, and the US to understand how different local contexts effect the ability of global union federations to implement IFAs."
0,"Considering the damage caused by the recent spate of catastrophic events (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001, and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004), it is increasingly clear that complex, large-scale environmental problems will characterize the twenty-first century. We contend that the ability of science to address these problems is attenuated by the ideological embrace of scientific-technical rationality. With scientific and technological pursuits increasingly marching to the drum beat of economic growth, is there a place for science to operate driven not by short-term profitability, but the long-term interests of the public and needs of the environment? Can the problems associated with complex, large-scale catastrophes be addressed adequately by science and technology alone, especially considering that technological failure may be the primary cause of the catastrophe? The purpose of this article is to provide answers to these questions and to offer a tenable solution to the challenges posed by recent catastrophes. First, we outline a framework to better understand the changing relationship between science, stakeholders, and environmental problems. Second, we make the case that recent catastrophes are qualitatively different from past disasters. As a result, we discuss (1) the reasons why dichotomizing disasters as natural or technological is increasingly problematic empirically; and (2) the inability of traditional science to effectively address issues, damages, and problems stemming from recent catastrophes. Finally, we suggest that the more participatory approach of postnormal science, strengthened by the precautionary principle and worst-case analysis, is a viable strategy for addressing complex, large-scale catastrophes."
0,"This study uses survey data to test the correlation between empathic concern and 14 different prosocial. behaviors, including informal help to individuals and formal helping through institutions. Statistically significant correlations were found for 10 behaviors, but substantively meaningful correlations were only found for three, all of which were spontaneous, informal helping behaviors, where the individual needing help was directly present. The findings indicate that empathic concern may not be an important motivator for planned helping decisions and decisions to help others who are not immediately present, such as volunteering, charitable giving, and blood donation. The weak correlation between empathic concern and most helping behaviors indicates that individual differences in empathic concern may not play much a role in helping decisions.

0,"Current debates over identity politics hinge on the question of whether status-based social movements encourage parochialism and self-interest or create possibilities for mutual recognition across lines of difference. Our article explores this question through comparative, ethnographic study of two racially progressive social movements, ""pro-black"" abolitionism and ""conscious"" hip hop. We argue that status-based social movements not only enable collective identity, but also the personal identities or selves of their participants. Beliefs about the self create openings and obstacles to mutual recognition and progressive social action. Our analysis centers on the challenges that an influx of progressive, anti-racist whites posed to each movement. We examine first how each movement configured movement participation and racial identity and then how whites crafted strategic narratives of the self to account for their participation in a status-based movement they were not directly implicated in. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of these narratives for a critical politics of recognition."
0,"This article examines how political critics (conservatives and liberals) use discourse to vilify Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, during the first 100 days of their respective administrations.  I conduct a comparative content analysis of political discourse with data from print media (letters to the editor) and electronic media (blog posts).  I find that conservative and liberal critics, respectively, vilify Presidents Clinton and Bush's informal legitimacy, primarily attacking their policy proposals.  In contrast, conservative critics vilify President Obama's formal and informal legitimacy, primarily attacking his “questionable” American, racial, political, and religious identities.  Conservative critics' vilification of President Obama is particularly effective in that: since he is viewed as de-legitimate by default, it is nearly impossible for him to prove his political opponents otherwise; the combination of attacks on Obama's formal and informal legitimacy provides both legal and non-legal rationales for opposing him; and conservative critics' portrayal of President Obama as an enemy compels Republican politicians to derail his legislative agenda."
0,"Navigating political action typically requires coalition building across different interest groups. Because members represent divergent interests and are embedded in different networks, however alliance formation is difficult. In this article, I consider how elites rely on political brokerage to overcome these divisions and form successful coalitions, with successful organization of the parliamentary opposition to the king before the English Civil War as a case in point. Supporting quantitative evidence comes from rich network data on the business, kinship, and political affiliations among 346 political and mercantile elites. Rather than the mere presence of mediator positions, I argue that effective brokerage of mobilizing alliances between interest groups requires political mediators who are equally affiliated with these diverse networks. Successful brokerage is conditional on both their structural position between groups and the diversity of ties that compose their personal networks. The results demonstrate that new merchant elites who were engaged in the American colonial trades acted as political mediators and facilitated the formation of a parliamentary opposition strong enough to defeat the royalist forces in London."
0,"Despite the strong and growing presence of women as immigrants to the United States, immigration policies have too often been scripted without adequately considering the lives, experiences, and needs of immigrant women. Or, when they have been written with immigrant women in mind, too often they fail to take into account the varied and multiple experiences of immigrant women, and therefore are not as useful to women of different classes, nationalities, races, sexualities, and statuses. In this article, we examine the intersection of gender and U.S. immigration policy. We also analyze the intersections among gender and other social categories central to immigrant women’s lives. We simultaneously address both levels of intersection, asking how immigration policies differentially impact various groups of immigrant women. We have chosen two specific policy areas to consider: first, family-based immigration policies, which are ostensibly gender-neutral, and second, the overtly gendered policies regarding intimate partner violence. Included in the analyses are recommendations for policy changes that are more sensitive to immigrant women’s multiple and varied experiences."
0,"The question how to regulate the bequest of wealth has been an issue of great controversy in modern societies over the last 200 years. In this paper I analyze the discursive structures of inheritance law debates in France, Germany and the United States. I  argue in the first part that in each country a distinct sets of issues and arguments have developed that exercise a dominant influence over the perception of the problems associated with the transfer of wealth mortis causa and the strategies deemed feasible to solve them. These culturally framed notions of property remain stable over long periods of time and shape discourses on inheritance law. They equip actors with culturally legitimated patterns of justification for the support or opposition to specific measures. In the second part of the paper I look at the actual development of one important field of inheritance law, estate taxation. I will describe the enduring differences which developed with regard to inheritance taxation and ask how this institutional development can be explained. Considering the distinct discursive structure in each of the three countries, it is looked at the contribution of these cultural frames to the legal changes. This shall help to analyze institutional development within a pluralistic theoretical framework that acknowledges the influence of culture, but also considers functional demands as well as economic and social interests."
0,"Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of attention toward immigration policy. But the new twist on this old story is that first, immigrants are increasingly gravitating toward “new destinations.” Second, a large and growing portion of immigrants are undocumented. Given the federal vacuum in responding to the promise and problems of these new immigration trends, states have been left holding the bag. Accordingly, we have seen innovation on the state level as policy makers seek to accommodate, welcome, or resist immigration, with varying levels of success. This paper explores the case of Utah as a new immigration destination, focusing on the inception, implementation and dilution of its policy to extend driver licenses to undocumented immigrants. Utah – not normally considered a trailblazer in immigration policy – was an early adopter of this policy. And its impact was notable in terms of its reach and facilitation of immigrant integration. However, over time Utah has transitioned from being one of the most welcoming states in the nation vis-a-vis its immigration policy, to one of the most restrictive. To explain this trajectory, this paper evaluates the merits of two policy perspectives: material versus ideational explanations. It finds an absence of the material conditions which typically predict restrictive immigration policies. In contrast, it finds that the richness of current ideational analyses helps clarify the paradox of Utah’s immigration policy trajectory."
0,"Though it has produced a high-quality body of research, the study of substance use has remained highly individualized in its focus. This paper adds further sociological understanding to that research. Using hierarchical models, the following explores how institutional and criminological theories can be incorporated into substance use research by examining cigarette smoking at 3 levels of variation. Two main findings emerge. First, national legal context plays a role in understanding individual-level probabilities of substance use, even after controlling for individual and local characteristics. For example, lower probabilities of smoking occur where there are smoking bans and minimum purchase ages. Second, the effects of local context, such as unemployment and the percentage of young people, exhibit significant effects on individual-level cigarette use."
0,"In this article, the authors examine ethnic identity development among Korean adoptees and the ways they explore their ethnicity in early adulthood. They argue that social context plays an important role in mediating whether and how adoptees pursue ethnic exploration. Employing a grounded theory analysis of a uniquely representative sample of Korean adoptees, they find that historical period and institutional setting shape the availability, content, and experience of exploration. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for research on racial stratification, ethnic assimilation, ethnic identity, and transracial adoptees."
0,"The goal of ""college-for-all"" in the United States has been pursued in an environment of rising tuition, stagnant grant aid and already strapped family budgets with the gap filled by college loans. College students are thus facing increasing levels of debt as they seek to develop their human capital and improve their career options. Debt is a useful resource for making needed investments. It is unique as a resource, however, because it must be repaid and can thus also increase vulnerabilities and limit options. We find that lower levels of educational debt do support college completion. However, additional educational debt beyond about $10,000 actually reduces the likelihood of college completion compared to lower levels of debt as the burden of repayment looms. Graduation likelihoods for students from the bottom 75% of the income distribution at public universities are especially influenced by debt. The article considers how the macro-level changes in financing societal functions influence the individual-level risks and vulnerabilities of life in a debt-based society."
0,"Many writings emphasize repressive aspects of authoritarian regimes and resistance against them from society. Paying attention to long-standing stability of the Park Chung Hee regime (1961-1979), this paper attempts to investigate one way in which repressive regimes generate political legitimacy and examines class politics as a ruling strategy of the regime and its reactions. In the 1960s, both working class and middle class were the beneficiaries of a rapid economic developmental project and pseudo-hegemony was formed corresponding to the expansion of the total economic scale. However, the social base for popular support attenuated in the 1970s as income disparity deepened and political repression grew severe. At times when anti-regime worker mobilization intensified, the urban middle class opted for the status quo aligning themselves with state ideology. In short, working class exclusion and middle class inclusion constituted the central mechanism for the generation of regime legitimacy and the necessary political coalition between the working and middle classes for wide opposition and democratization was blocked."
0,"In studies of mass ideology, it is often found that political values are ordered two-dimensionally among the public at large. In a first economic dimension, equality is contested; in a second cultural one, individual freedom is contested. While this general rule of two-dimensionality applies to the public at large, there are large differences between educational categories. While two-dimensionality is found for the lower educated, the higher educated order their values along a single dimension and hence show more value coherence. Using a recent Dutch national survey, we show that these differences between the higher and the lower educated cannot be explained by differences in political competence. Instead, a combination Of cultural and economic insecurity is responsible for the lower levels of value coherence among the lower educated."
0,"Much work within linguistics and conversation analysis has been devoted to examining how shared knowledge and mutual understanding are managed.  Much less effort has been focused on how the sharing of personal experience is managed as an interactional process. Yet this kind of sharing involves some of the most intimate forms of mutuality between persons, and may be central in the formation and management of social bonds.  This paper offers a sketch of some of the ways in which recipients of talk about personal experiences can manage (or fail to manage) moments of empathic connection with their interlocutors."
0,"This study investigates the intergenerational transmission of parents' religious views and divorce attitudes, paying particular attention to the effect of parent-child closeness. We use structural equation modeling to examine a national longitudinal data set containing information from 455 married individuals and their adult offspring. We find that parent religiosity influences Young adults' views of divorce via two pathways: by affecting offspring's religiosity and parents' views of divorce. More religious offspring are less tolerant of divorce, but offspring who do not share their parents' religious practices are nonetheless influenced by their parents' religiously-influenced divorce attitudes. While parent religiosity has no effect on parent-child closeness, religious offspring report having been closer to their parents, suggesting that their Current religious practices may affect their perceptions of the parent-child relationship.

0,"The social movement literature offers several approaches to understanding governments policy response to the demands of movement activists.   Not all of these explanations specify how the independent variables should shape government decision-making, and if they do, they too often fail to demonstrate such a process.  The framing approach tends to exhibit such shortcomings.  Framing analysis seems particularly unsuited to explaining government policy response, although it has proven useful for illuminating the important role played by audience perceptions of movement issues, events, and actors.  Its broad definitions and loose hypotheses render it difficult to prove wrong.  Therefore, I present a set of hypotheses based on the framing approach that can be falsified, and then test them against data from the nationalist movement in Quebec (1960-present).  The framing approach fails to explain the major concessions offered to Quebec by the Canadian government, although it can shed light on the attitudes of the domestic population toward Quebecs autonomy attempts.  An alternative approach to understanding government response to regional movements is briefly discussed.  The intent is not to dismiss the framing approach, but merely to suggest that we define and operationalize it more precisely to determine which questions it is most suited to answer."
0,"Using a sample of households nested in census tracts in 24 metropolitan areas over four time points, this study provides a robust test of the determinants of neighborhood satisfaction, taking into account the census tract context. Consistent with social disorganization theory, the presence of racial/ethnic heterogeneity and single-parent households consistently reduced neighborhood satisfaction. Those perceiving more social or physical disorder were considerably less satisfied with the neighborhood, and perceiving more crime showed an accelerating negative effect on satisfaction. Furthermore, the effect of perceiving crime was exacerbated in tracts with a distressed labor market or the presence of disengaged youth. There was consistent evidence that those with more economic investment (homeowners) or social investment (married residents and parents) in the neighborhood are more satisfied. On the other hand, longer-term residents did not report more satisfaction, nor did general residential stability in the tract increase satisfaction."
0,"The aim of this study was to examine individual-level factors associated with homelessness in Tehran. Researchers interviewed 318 homeless adults aged 18-80 years in city shelters. Regression results indicated that self-esteem, family attachment, weak social networks, drug abuse, and childhood criminal victimization were all significantly related to homelessness. There has been no systematic investigation on homelessness in Iran, and thus ours is the first study of its kind. We situate our findings in the empirical literature on homelessness from other nations, and describe the implications of our results for the Iranian homeless."
0,"While existing research on parenthood and employment focuses largely on mothers, a handful of studies reveal that mens labor market earnings increase as they become fathers. These studies, however, have focused on family-based explanatory mechanisms of the fatherhood wage premium. In contrast, the current study analyzes the occupational contexts of the fatherhood wage premium. I ask: Do men in womens jobs take an accelerated ride up the glass escalator by virtue of becoming a parent? Using data from the 1983 to 2002 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and individual fixed effects models, I find that as the proportion of women in mens jobs increases, and as men move towards token-status, the rewards for becoming a father increase as well. Of men in female-dominated jobs, such as those in elementary school teaching positions, fathers of three children earn about three dollars more per hour than childless mena difference that amounts to more than six thousand dollars per year. Because estimates are from models that include individual fixed effects, a host of control variables, as well as occupational variables that have not been included in previous studies, differences in average wages result primarily from the gender composition of mens jobs. Fatherhood does not come with equal rewards to all men. Instead, as men begin to stand out as the minority in their job, the rewards for becoming a parent increase."
0,"Explanations of variability in public opinion on crime have drawn disproportionately from the literature on specific symbolic orientations including religious fundamentalism and racial prejudice. In contrast, this article hypothesizes that public opinion is linked to the strength of a general cultural axis of nations: survivalism vs. self-expressionism. Data are from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey. Hierarchical modeling techniques are used to sort out the bi-level effects of survivalist culture on the approval of prostitution. Controlling for all other predictors, the personal survivalism index was the most powerful predictor of prostitution acceptability, followed by the country-level survivalism index. Unlike previous investigations, which relied on specific symbolic orientations, the present results suggest that attitudes about criminality are linked to a generalized cultural axis."

We build from the hypothesis that homeownership provides people a sense of stability which decreases the extent to which they feel stressed as a result of financial hardship.

0,"This research proposes a contextual approach to study of social support among dual-earner families. It focuses on the ecological and social environment of the family and treats it as an opportunity structure for the formation of supportive social ties. Using data from the 500 Family Study and the 2000 Census, we examine how characteristics of the community in which dual-earner families are embedded are associated with social support at the family level. Preliminary results provide support to the resource hypothesis, showing that the level of family social support is highest in communities of high socioeconomic status. Results from a Hierarchical Linear Model further indicate that family social support is positively related to community social support. This finding suggests that dual-earner families are able to connect to the social networks of support of other families in their immediate environment and take advantage of neighboring families social resources in times of need."
0,"Using the case of the gender equal employment opportunity policy in Japan, I intend to examine the relationship between legal reforms and attitudinal changes.  Even as the low fertility rate is an urgent issue in Japan today, the state has implemented policies designed to increase womens employment  policies which may well fuel further fertility decline.  Womens participation in the formal labor market is becoming extremely important in Japan today.  Does Japan resolve the issue of traditional gender roles which interacts with recent social challenges  employed mothers, fertility decline, shortage of labor force, and immigration?  When and how do attitudes toward womens employment transform to international norms?  There is a contradiction between legal reforms and gender role expectations in contemporary Japan.  Diffusion of international legal norms explains why such a contradiction, or decoupling, is present; it is internationally normative that modern nation-states have a gender equal employment opportunity law.  My research focuses on how the relationship between legal reforms and attitudinal changes shifted over time.  I intend to delve into the process of legal reforms and social norm transformation in Japan since the 1980s."
0,"This paper extends Giugni and Passys (1998) model of how modern Western incorporated social movements interact with the state, a relationship they call conflictual-cooperation.  Giugni and Passy aim to demonstrate how this relationship can be distinguished from earlier models of movement institutionalization and propose that movements maintain their integrity even when engaging in highly collaborative relationships with the state.  I draw from an ethnographic study of homeless service provider and advocacy organizations in Philadelphia to suggest that Giugni and Passy neglected two important dynamics in their discussion.  First, in addition to prevailing inclusive strategies by the state, smos must aim at expanding state intervention in society.  Second, a cooperative relationship would not only entail the transfer of knowledge to the state, but an exchange of information between the two camps.  These two dynamics help explain why one of the implications of cooperation is that movements become less likely to engage in protest politics. I hypothesize that the dynamics may obstruct the process of diagnostic framing or the attribution of threat or opportunity (McAdam 2003, p. 291) that makes collective mobilization possible."
0,"Throughout much of 2001 the Mobilization for Global Justice Coalition (MGJC) planned a series of mass demonstrations targeting the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to occur in Washington. DC in late September The terrorist attacks of September 11 created a crisis for the 117 social movement organizations (SMO) involved in the broad-based coalition and forced protest leaders to reevaluate their coalition strategy. This analysis chronicles the dissolution of the MGJC and explains the decisions made by SMO leaders to abandon or disband the coalition. By leading their organizations in ways they expected to be perceived as legitimate in the eyes of key allies and supporters, leaders sought to preserve their SMO's core exchange relationships through the 9/11 crisis. At a minimum, leaders sought to insulate their organizations from irreparable harm and position them competitively for the uncertainties of the post-crisis environment. Many organizations made decisions commensurate with homophilous or exemplary organizations in a process resembling ""social contagion"" while others capitalized on the crisis enhancing their influence. This research relies upon participant observations of pre- and post-9/11 organizing meetings, examination of coalition documents, and interviews with key MGJC leaders."
0,"We propose a political reform theory, a political and historical institutionalist argument that holds that shifts in political structures, partisan regimes and policy greatly influence movements. We appraise this argument, along with resource mobilization, political opportunity and media alternatives, by analyzing 600,000 articles in the New York Times and Washington Post that mention national U.S. social movement organizations (SMOs) in the largest 34 SMO industries across the twentieth century. We provide multivariate analyses of industry-level article mentions of SMOs and detailed analyses of the historical trajectories of coverage across the century. Although we find some support for major theories of movements and media influences, the political reform theory is strongly supported and outperforms standard political opportunity models. We conclude with suggestions to synthesize theories and for research on movement and media outcomes."

Results show a panethnic effect-greater residential proximity within panethnic boundaries than between, net of ethnic group size and metropolitan area that is dependent on immigration. A lower degree of social distance between panethnic subgroups is observed for blacks, whites, and Latinos, and less for Asians, yet ethnonational groups continue to maintain some degree of distinctiveness within a racialized context."
0,"Drawing from in-depth interviews, participant observation, and document analysis we examine a contentious environmental dispute surrounding contamination from a decommissioned zinc smelter plant in rural Oklahoma. Environmental grievances center around potential health effects associated with lead, cadmium, and arsenic contamination. The company that owns the former zinc smelter facility argues that they are operating in compliance with all environmental health and safety standards and many citizens applaud their ongoing remediation efforts. In an effort to improve its public image, the company has launched a community outreach program and is offering to sample residents' yards. A group of concerned citizens, however, believes that the health and safety of their community have been compromised by the environmental contamination. These residents have garnered legal support from a nonlocal law firm and they plan to pursue legal damages as part of their campaign of environmental cleanup. Both sides have engaged in a heated public dialogue to mobilize support for their respective campaigns. The results of our study indicate that the environmental dispute is centered on the ambiguity of harm and conflicting perceptions of causation."
0,"In this paper, I challenge understandings of grassroots social movement politics as emerging from purely outsider constituencies, that is, groups of outsiders unaffiliated with institutional power.   I argue against simplistic views of insider activists as sell-outs, stressing that we need a holistic view of social movement politics as a hybrid realm of innovation, institutional access, and above all, contention with established power.  My empirical research focuses chiefly on one social movement organization   ACT UP/LA (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power/Los Angeles), chiefly in the early 1990s.  The ethnographic, archival, and interview-based data used is drawn from a larger, in-progress project about the genesis, history, and demise of ACT UP/LA.  Following the consideration the blurring of insider/outsider boundaries in ACT UP/LAs emergence, agenda, tactics, and demise, I conclude that assessing the grassroots nature of a movement organization entails asking the following questions: who are the movement organizations key players and what networks do they come from; what kinds of targets do challengers choose, and whether/how cooperative action might occur with those in power in order to further goals; how new is the area of contention itself; and what kinds of grassroots politics can social movement activists carry into institutional settings."
0,"This paper investigates the double standard in attitudes toward courtship and family formation behaviors of sons and daughters. We argue there are strong theoretical reasons to expect that the magnitude of this double standard varies across substantive domains, as well as among parents and non-parents. We also argue key methodological limitations of previous studies likely produce an under-estimate of the gender double standard. We provide empirical estimates of the gender double standard that overcome these limitations, including a random-assignment experiment explicitly designed to control the effects of social desirability. These estimates demonstrate variability in the double standard across domains and reveal key factors contributing to the magnitude of the double standards in parenting attitudes held by individuals.

0,"This research examines the gendered nature of cultural legitimacy and consecration in popular music. We explore two related questions. First, which factors affect the likelihood that female performers achieve consecrated status? Second, how are those decisions discursively legitimated? Using a mixed-methods research design, we find that in both direct and indirect ways, gender significantly shapes a performer's likelihood of consecration, leaving female artists at a disadvantage in this process. Moreover, the discursive strategies employed to justify artists' inclusion among the all-time greats are shaped by existing cultural frameworks about art and gender, limiting in more subtle and indirect ways the amount and type of legitimacy that female artists can accrue."
0,"This paper uses new data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) to examine how neighborhood norms shape teenagers' substance use. Specifically, it takes advantage of clustered data at the neighborhood level to relate adult neighbors' attitudes and behavior with respect to smoking, drinking, and drugs, which we treat as norms, to teenagers' own smoking, drinking, and drug use. We use hierarchical linear models to account for parents' attitudes and behavior and other characteristics of individuals and families. We also investigate how the association between neighborhood norms and teen behavior depends on: (1) the strength of norms, as measured by consensus in neighbors' attitudes and conformity in their behavior; (2) the willingness and ability of neighbors to enforce norms, for instance, by monitoring teens' activities; and (3) the degree to which teens are exposed to their neighbors. We find little association between neighborhood norms and teen substance use, regardless of how we condition the relationship. We discuss possible theoretical and methodological explanations for this finding. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"This paper examines stratification of opportunities in college access and completion. Using propensity score methods, we investigate two comparisons: (1) four- versus two-year public colleges and (2) private versus public two-year colleges. While previous research finds lower degree completion in two-year than in four-year public colleges, the comparability of students is doubtful. This paper re-considers the public four-year college effect, but for similar students and additional relevant outcomes. The second comparison is a new one. Though recruiting similar students as public two-year colleges, private two-year colleges use different organizational procedures, and we find that they have a different impact on comparable students' degree completion. We speculate about the reasons for these differences and whether they suggest potential benefits of adapting these procedures for public two-year colleges. "
0,"The growth of the field of immigration in multiple directions and across disciplines and areas presents an opportune juncture to pause and reflect on the central role sociology has played in the study of immigrants and immigration, as well as to assess the contributions that immigration research has made to sociology. This essay discusses three subfields in Sociology in which the sociological study of immigrants has contributed to bring new light to long-standing questions: family, religion, and ethnic and racial studies. At the same time, it brings up areas - culture and arts, social movements and civic engagement, and citizenship, belonging and the state - in which immigration scholars in sociology could establish a more vibrant intellectual dialog with those subfields. Far from exhausting the discussion, these comments are intended to offer potential avenues for further research and discussion."
0,"Many scholars and policy makers of education have focused significant attention on male advantages in math skills during adolescence, but have often overlooked female advantages in math skills that emerge before school begins. As a way to explain this conflicting pattern, some scholars cite exposure to schooling as a reason why girls experience what some have termed girls' ""reversal of fortunes."" By using first-of-its-kind data I examine math-related skills with proscriptive data from early to late childhood using two nationally-representative data sets. Moving beyond standardized assessments of math skills, this study reconciles these two competing trends using subset measures. Far from a reversal of fortunes, girls excel in math skills that are less complex (i.e. counting, shape recognition) across childhood. Girls' disadvantages in math emerge with content change-as item complexity increases over time (i.e. multiplication, division, and fractions). In contrast to standardized assessments of cognitive skills, gender gaps in item complexity may be more revealing for understanding the origins and development of gender stratification. "
0,"Sociologists consider inequality in educational attainment to be a major cause of inequality between people in their chances of occupying a more advantageous class position. However, there is dispute as to whether educational inequality according to social class background declined during the 20(th) century. What is not in doubt is the expansion of education in the advanced economies during this time, and several authors have pointed to educational expansion as a mechanism by which inequalities in social mobility chances may be reduced. I measure this effect and compare it with the impact of educational equalization on social mobility in Britain, Sweden and Germany during the 20(th) century. I find that in all three countries educational expansion promoted greater social mobility."

Researchers argue that male migrants tend to dominate leadership positions within the HTA structure because they long to return to patriarchal México, while women migrants prefer to settle permanently in the U.S., where social relationships are more egalitarian. I argue that hard and fast notions of Mexican patriarchy conceal important variation at the leadership level in HTAs. The results of logistic regression on data provided by the Institute for Mexicans Abroad and the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that the location of HTAs in the U.S. has a significant effect on the gender of organization leaders and contrary to previous research, the presence of the Mexican state is found to have a positive effect on the participation of women in HTAs."
0,"This article builds on an important but underdeveloped social science concept the ""scene"" as a cluster of urban amenities-to contribute to social science theory and subspecialties such as urban and rural, class, race and gender studies Scenes grow more important in less industrial, more expressively-oriented and contingent societies where traditional constraints fall and self-motivated action mound consumption, leisure and amenities is a more important feature of social cohesiveness and interaction. Scenes contextualize the individual through amenities and consumption-based expressions of shared sensibilities as to what is right, beautiful and genuine. This framework adds to concepts such as neighborhood and workplace by specifying 15 dimensions of the urban scenescape. Like neighborhood and workplace, scenes reduce anomie, but because of their focus on consumption and the use of specific amenities, they are more consistent with today's ethos of contingency, moving beyond traditional ideas of the fundamental power of social, family and occupational background. We introduce a new amenities-focused database to measure and analyze scenes and their dimensions for each of 40,000 U.S. zip codes. We illustrate the framework by applying it to one distinct type of scene, bohemia, and analyze its position in the broader social system."
0,"How are the lives of middle-class third-generation Mexican Americans both racialized and gendered? Third-generation Mexican Americans in California experience a racialization process continuum that extends from ""flexible ethnicity,"" the ability to be considered an ""insider"" in different racial/ethnic communities, to racialization as nonwhite that is enforced through the deployment of negative stereotypes. Using interview data, the author finds that women are afforded more ""flexible ethnicity"" than men. Accordingly, men are more rigorously racialized than women. Women are racialized through exoticization, whereas men are racialized as threats to safety. Lighter-skinned individuals escaped consistent racialization. These findings have consequences for the incorporation possibilities of later-generation Mexican Americans, as women and light-skinned (often multiracial) individuals are more frequently granted ""flexible ethnicity"" and less strongly racialized than men and dark-skinned (often monoracial) individuals. Even among the structurally assimilated, contemporary racial and gender hierarchies limit the voluntary quality of ethnicity among third-generation Mexican Americans."

0,"The accumulation of chemicals in human bodies and ecosystems represents a universal environmental and technological risk. As yet, little attention has been paid to media coverage of ""body burdens,"" the internal contaminant load carried by most organisms in the industrialized world. Using a sociology of risk perspective, this article analyzes the framing of chemical bioaccumulation in Canadian newspaper articles from 1986 to 2006. In later years, articles employ frames that reinforce an individualization of risk, where individuals are encouraged to avoid contaminants through ""precautionary consumption"" of green consumer goods. This shift in media discourse suggests that self-protection is emerging as a key frame in the discourse of risk, one that provides a sense of individual control over chemical exposure and shifts the focus away from collective forms of protection from universal risks."
0,"This paper explores the role of preventive sexual health beliefs (such as susceptibility) and gender norms in adolescent sexual decision making.  I draw on the Health Belief Model for theoretical background on the predicted relationship between adolescents' preventive sexual health beliefs and behaviors.  I argue, however, that this relationship is modified by adolescents' desire to behave in a manner consistent with the traditional performance of gender.  Based on qualitative interviews with 25 adolescents, I conclude that sufficient evidence exists to support the contention that health beliefs interact with gender norms to reduce the likelihood that adolescents will make decisions that protect their sexual health.  I conclude by offering suggestions on how the efficacy of school-based sex education programs could be improved by increased attention to the role of gender norms in adolescents' sexual decision making."
0,"Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, propensity score matching is used to estimate the effect of cohabiting on subsequent marital quality as compared to those who marry without experiencing a cohabitation. I divide the sample into two, those who only cohabited with their eventual marriage partner and those who experienced a cohabitation with a non-marital partner. I find there is no treatment effect among those whose cohabitation experience is restricted to their future spouse, while those who had a different partner experienced a decline in marital quality as compared to those with no cohabitation experience. Various matching algorithms are used and robustness tests are performed. These results suggest that it is experience of different residential partners that decreases subsequent marital quality, rather than cohabitation itself."
0,"Traditional markers of adulthood – leaving home, completing school, establishing financial independence, marriage, and childbearing – have become strikingly delayed or foregone in the latter half of the twentieth century, particularly for the working class. While existing literature focuses on the disappearance of these markers, this study investigates the processes through which working-class men and women project meaning, coherence, and biographical continuity onto their dislocated experiences of coming of age. Drawing upon 100 interviews with working-class men and women in their mid-twenties to early thirties, I ask: in an era of increasing uncertainty and insecurity, where self-evident markers of adulthood have disappeared, what kinds of cultural codes and resources do working-class young people employ to validate their self-growth? And, what are the implications of their new visions of adulthood for the reproduction of inequality?  In the absence of institutionalized rites of passage, I find that respondents are faced with the challenge of creating narratives of adulthood on their own. Specifically, over three fourths of respondents rely on a model of therapeutic selfhood – that of an inner-directed self preoccupied with its own emotional and psychic repair – to cope with the disappearance of traditional forms of identity. However, respondents often lack the economic and social resources to realize their new visions of competent adulthood."
0,"Organizational de-coupling occurs when organizational adoption of programs is separated from ongoing activities Neo-institutional theory asserts it is an effective coping strategy for modern organizations to deal with increasingly elaborated environments In this paper we investigate the consequences of organizational de-coupling from an inward-looking within organizational perspective Specifically we study how the de-coupling of flexible work program affects workers actualization of productivity Our data analysis suggests that the organizational de-coupling in which organizations only ceremonially adopt flexible work program without making it available to all workers, is detrimental to the actualization of productivity for workers who were bereft of the opportunity In contrast we find that the highest level of productivity actualization is associated with workers who enjoy a factual flexible work schedule which is nevertheless not formally adopted by the employer The implications of the findings are discussed "
0,"This paper assesses the institutional and organization-level processes that influence women and mens share of formal job training, using a random sample of 1002 US work organizations. Recent studies have focused on the effect of organization-level characteristics on training, but none have explored whether and how these work differently in predominantly male and female occupations.  Our analysis finds a somewhat higher incidence of training among women than men.  Higher proportions of female workers in the occupation, more complex occupations, and establishments that are part of a larger organization (i.e., subsidiaries) increase womens access to training.  Organizations with more formalized procedures and that produce a product are associated with decreases in the percentage of those trained who are women.  Most importantly, the effects of organizational formalization and institutionalization of training on womens share of training vary depending upon the sex composition of the occupation."
0,"When entrepreneurs enter structural holes in networks, they can exploit the related benefits. Evidence for these benefits has steadily accumulated. The authors ask whether those who strive for such structural advantages can maintain them if others follow their example. Burt speculates that they cannot, but a formal demonstration of this speculation is lacking. Using a game theoretic model of network formation, the authors characterize the networks that emerge when everyone strives for structural holes. They find that the predominant stable networks distribute benefits evenly, confirming that no one is able to maintain a structural advantage in the long run."
0,"This paper examines relationship between efforts to create gender equity in academic STEM fields and how these efforts relate to theories of gendered organizations. Specifically, we examine NSF ADVANCE institutional transformation programs to reveal gender inequality producing mechanisms operating within academic bureaucracies. We consider what ADVANCE grant initiatives imply for creating more gender equitable academic settings and careers. More broadly, by establishing interactions among organizational context, logic, and mechanisms, we reveal how inequalities in bureaucracies are fluid and reproduced in context specific ways."
0,"What role do children play in education and stratification? Are they merely passive recipients of unequal opportunities that schools and parents create for them? Or do they actively shape their own opportunities? Through a longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse, public elementary school, I show that children's social-class backgrounds affect when and how they seek help in the classroom. Compared to their working-class peers, middle-class children request more help from teachers and do so using different strategies. Rather than wait for assistance, they call out or approach teachers directly, even interrupting to make requests. In doing so, middle-class children receive more help from teachers, spend less time waiting, and are better able to complete assignments. By demonstrating these skills and strategies, middle-class children create their own advantages and contribute to inequalities in the classroom. These findings have implications for theories of cultural capital, stratification, and social reproduction."
0,"In this paper, I show the multiple and conflicting ontologies of autism through the lens of discourse, and thus ultimately through the multiple and conflicting epistemologies of autism.  The autism of biopsychiatry and cognitive neuroscience is not the same as the autism of the DSM, despite ultimate dependence upon traditional psychiatry and the medical model of autism for the purpose of classifying people.  The autism of the PET scan cannot exist without the classifications set forth in the DSM, for without pre-identifying some brains as autistic based upon behavior, there is no way to distinguish the autistic brain from the non-autistic brain.  So far, there is little consensus as to what actually does constitute an autistic neurology, and researchers have taken strides to mask what the autistic neurology might have in common with the non-autistic neurology.  Instead, alternative epistemologies of autism  as a queer performance of cognition  that do not deny the biological ontology foreclosed in traditional critiques of biomedicine  are foreclosed in the name of biopower."
0,"Social exchange theories have identified social structural factors and interaction processes that build cohesion through the everyday exchange of valued resources. However, the types of resources considered in previous research do not reflect the properties of many commonly exchanged resources, namely information, social support, and material goods. In this article, I identify two resource dimensions that underlie and affect exchange: (1) duplicability, that is, whether a resource provider retains control of the resource after exchange and (2) transferability, that is, whether a resource recipient can exchange the resource in another relation. I present a causal model to explain how these dimensions affect cohesion through the mediating effects of structural power exchange frequency. and uncertainty. Notably, resource variation alters the source of structural power, making it necessary to specify when different power mechanisms will operate and their disparate effects on the other mediating factors. A laboratory experiment provides support for the causal model. Resource characteristics fundamentally shape both the exchange process and the outcomes actors experience."

After the collapse of the selling of high fat, salty, and sugary foods in the public schools by food companies due to parent and community reaction. The students took over the business and are profiting much, creating a black market, selling to each other these products (Cola, chocolates, potato chips, etc...), even though they were banned by most schools. The study uses a theoretical oriented narrative for the ethnographic interviews.  The study focuses on, a) analyzing why teens risk themselves, b) how relationships are, and c) what the image assumptions are, in this organized black market of food in their schools."
0,"In the United States, identified as “the world’s most religiously diverse nation” (Eck 2002), religious identity has the power to shape vastly different kinds of lifestyles and ways of navigating the social world.  Though historically, sociology of religion has focused mainly on understanding adult religiosity, recent work argues that adolescents experience religious identity formation in ways that can both help us to understand how adults achieve identities and how adolescents experience religion in their own right.  Such work locates religious identity as an outcome of multiple socialization processes, resulting in tangible behaviors and practices.  Complicating the issue are the nation’s religious minorities, whose outcomes can not always be measured using the same tools as their Christian counterparts.  In this paper, I draw from an ethnographic framework to examine identity development in Jewish and Islamic middle schools.  Using data from schools’ graduation ceremonies, I argue that the construction of an identity narrative itself is the primary intended outcome of religious education in this setting, altering how we conceptualize “successful” religious education."
0,"Using the case of visual art displayed in the home, this paper theoretically outlines and empirically illustrates the role that environments play in signaling black identity. Recent literature describes the role of cultural consumption for communicating black identity. However, scholars have yet to distinguish one especially important form of signifying black identityusing the environment as a stage to signal membership as black. This paper draws on 103 in-depth interviews with middle-class blacks in New York and Atlanta, and photographs of art in their homes. The conclusion discusses other ways that environments are used to symbolize black identity, and describes the implications of this practice for theory on cultural consumption and racial identity and theory on racialized environments."
0,"Previous research has shown that African Americans have worse physical health than Whites even with controls for socioeconomic status whereas African Americans have similar mental health than Whites with controls for socioeconomic status.  This research explores the role of discrimination, social support, and religion in this anomalous finding using the Midlife Development in the United States survey (MIDUS).  Results indicate that African Americans mental health is less affected by everyday discrimination than it is for Whites; however, their physical health is equally affected by everyday discrimination.  Social support from spouse, family, and friends and religious service attendance explain some of the interaction of everyday discrimination by race but do not explain all of it.  These findings indicate that African Americans have resources that make their mental health less susceptible to everyday discrimination, even though they do not have the same protective effect for their physical health."
0,"This article offers a comprehensive empirical analysis of the determinants of social movement mobilization, with serious consideration of countermovement leadership and infrastructure on terms comparable with those of the movement. The authors examine the role of resources, infrastructure, and leadership in tenant mobilization in the Los Angeles tenants' rights movement between 1976 and 1979. Using survey and census data along with archival materials, they compare neighborhoods across Los Angeles and find a significant role for resources, infrastructure, and leadership; notably, the authors find that countermovement infrastructure and leadership are more important to renter mobilization than movement infrastructure and leadership."

0,"While sociological analyses of collective memory are commonplace, a definition of the key concept is undertheorized.  Implicit in most collective memory research is the assumption that collective memory is only manifested in institutionalized objects.  These analyses conflate the production of the objectthe evolution of the object within, and constrained by, institutional and organizational formsand the objects receptionits representativeness of the memory of a given population.  To substantiate these claims, I examine current definitions of collective memory and the production/reception conflation as found in the literature on Holocaust collective memory.  To reconcile these assumptions, I propose a culture and cognition conception of collective memory.  I argue that collective memory is not an institutionalized object, per se, but an interactive process manifested in supraindividually located memory schemata.  The interaction process here is a binary one:  1) the cognitive interaction between culturally related individuals, and 2) a conceptual interaction between social agents and institutional forms.  Collective memory is often manifested in institutionalized objects and thus can become part of structure through systematic typificationit can be produced.  But it also naturally stems from social structure through the interaction of individuals with other institutionalized collective memory objectsit is received."
0,"In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. State proclaimed a “War on Terror,” solidly coupling immigration and terrorism concerns while simultaneously characterizing “illegal aliens” as potential “terrorists” via the Department of Homeland Security (Chacón and Davis 2006; Newman 2006; Fernandes 2007; Doty 2009; Massey 2009). This shift in the discourse has impacted the U.S.-Mexico border by re-framing this geo-socio-political boundary and its inhabitants as a potential terrorism threat to American National Security. This re-framing of the discourse ultimately led to a monumental federal State mandate – the Secure Fence Act of 2006 – a 670 mi. barrier between the U.S. and Mexico. Thus, the federal State via the physical barrier becomes a source of violence (both material and symbolic) expressed in specific forms and contingent upon intersecting biographical particulars (race/ethnicity, class, gender) of border residents and the historical-geographic context (Texas-Mexico border). I argue that this seepage into the lives of residents demonstrates the macro-micro linkages between the State and civil society and is the locus for understanding what I call the State as a lived experience. I examine this experiential construct by focusing on the narratives of twenty Texas Rio Grande Valley, specifically Coronado County residents, (in)directly impacted by the State mandate."
0,"Under conditions of uncertainty, we predict that development will be tied to the idiosyncrasy of organizational forms represented within local regions. Our investigation applies this theory to data on 342 counties and 43,352 businesses in the US. South during Reconstruction, finding support for the thesis that organizational idiosyncrasy generally dampens growth and challenges taken-for-granted norms of community structure. The causal effect varies somewhat depending on whether the underlying mechanisms entail increases in the production of local goods, the accumulation of fixed capital, or the attraction Of new residents and retention of existing ones. We conclude by considering if the theory may generalize to other settings, including locales that depart markedly from the close-knit agrarian culture of the postbellum South."
0,"Using a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effect of collaborative learning groups (CLGs) on college students attitudes, I examine the extent to which using CLGs in the context of test taking (collaborative testing) positively affects students attitudes toward their learning and their in-class experience. In this study, collaborative testing improved students attitudes concerning their learning, the quiz process, and the subject matter of the class (sociology). Moreover, students experiencing the group quizzes, wrote responses to survey questions that became more positive throughout the semester. These positive findings should encourage instructors and researchers to continue to use CLGs for testing and to study their effects on a range of student outcomes."
0,"Industrialized and newly industrialized countries in Asia have entered an era of below-replacement fertility (i.e., 2.1 children per woman of childbearing age).  For instance, the total fertility rates for Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore for 2009 were estimated at 1.4, 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, and 1.3 respectively (Population Reference Bureau, 2010).  The falling birthrates have led to the formulation and implementation of pronatalist policies, which include various forms of incentives to encourage citizens to have more children. In this paper, I describe and review the literature on the education system in Singapore before turning to the discussion of the findings of the study on pronatalist policy incentives and individual reproductive decision-makings.  Drawing on qualitative data collected from 165 in-depth interviews with women of childbearing age and 39 focus group discussions of women and their parents, parents-in-law and/or spouses in 2007 and 2008 in Singapore, I argue the existing educational system in the developmental state limits the efficacy of pronatalist policies."
0,"Disparities in cesarean rates in the United States represent an important social problem because cesareans are related to maternal deaths and to the high cost of American health care. There are pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in maternity care as in health care more generally, yet there has been little scrutiny of how overuse of cesarean deliveries might be linked to these disparities. There are at least two possibilities when it comes to c-sections: black, Hispanic, Native American, and low socioeconomic status (SES) mothers could be less likely to have needed cesareans, leading to more negative outcomes for both mothers and babies, or they could be more likely to have medically unnecessary cesareans, leading to more negative outcomes as a result of the surgery itself This research uses data on all recorded births in the United States in 2006 to analyze differences in the odds of a cesarean delivery by race-ethnicity and SES. The analysis reveals that non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/Latina, and Native American mothers are more likely to have cesarean deliveries than non-Hispanic white or Asian mothers. Also, after accounting for medical indications, increasing education is associated with a decline in odds of a cesarean delivery, especially for non-Hispanic whites. The results suggest that high cesarean rates are an indicator of low-quality maternity care, and that women with racial and socioeconomic advantages use them to avoid medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries rather than to request them."
0,"Punishment-centered organization cultures are a common phenomenon. In this paper, we suggest a structural theory of punishment centered organizational cultures which explains under which conditions the distribution of sanctions is heavily skewed towards punishments instead of rewards, why punishment threat fails to deter malperformance in such organizations, and how this affects the quality of social relations in the organization. Empirical hypotheses derived from this theory are tested with data from a large Dutch utility company. These data support the hypotheses that high damage potential of employees drives punishment centered cultures and that lead to a deterioration of vertical and horizontal trust relations. No support was however found for the hypothesis that management will mitigate the adverse consequences of this cultural syndrome by proactive governance efforts. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this theory and the findings for the role of punishment in modern organizations."
0,"In this paper I propose a new theoretical and methodological tools to assess immigrant integration process. Most sociological studies on assimilation process focused on upward social mobility of immigrants while leaving out politics. The politics of immigrants, often neglected, were treated as a separate domain from socio-economic mobility. I argue, however, that the choice between upward socio-economic mobility and active political participation is a central dilemma for the immigrants and their children. Some immigrants focus only on individual success through education and stable employment; some realize that group-level political mobilization could bring them the benefits as well; and other find themselves between these two strategies. How immigrants situate themselves within this continuum of market success and political power, I argue, is a key factor in immigrant integration to the U.S. society. To test this model, I analyze the data on immigrant second generation in New York City and develop four different typologies of immigrant strategies, using Latent Class Models. Then I explain the strategies more in detail by analyzing in-depth interview data. In the end, I discuss the implication of my model to some of the previous theories of immigrant integration, such as new assimilation and segmented assimilation."
0,"Combining statistical and ethnographic analyses, this article explores the prevalence and ramifications of eviction in the lives of the urban poor. A quantitative analysis of administrative and survey data finds that eviction is commonplace in inner-city black neighborhoods and that women from those neighborhoods are evicted at significantly higher rates than men. A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty."
0,"Traditonal models of socialization have focused on children as passive recipients of cultural knowledge.  More recently, sociologists have criticized this model of socialization, pointing out that children are full-fledged members of society who are capable of acting independently and shaping their own social worlds.  This qualitative, content-analysis research examines the extent to which children are depicted in storybooks as either passive recipients of culture or active members of society.  This study draws from a sample of 101 children’s books on the topic of death, grief, and bereavement.  All of these books are intended for children between the ages of four and eight years old and most were written explicitly to help children as they cope with the death of a loved one.  As a result, the books contain a mixture of both overt and implied suggested strategies to help children cope with grief.  Interestingly, while some of the books convey the message that children need not worry because adult caretakers will always look after them, other books urge children to take control of their own lives, cautioning that adult caretakers might be too consumed with their own grief to look out for the children’s needs.  This research takes a closer look at these recommendations, investigating the particular types of action that children are urged to take, the degree of child agency that is advocated, and the social context in which child-dependency versus child-agency are portrayed."
0,"This project explores the meaning of membership for twenty undergraduate members of a Black Greek organization on a predominantly white campus.  In the context of high attrition rates for African American men in higher education (DeSousa & Kuh 1996), the project focuses on one possible mechanism of success and explores how the members utilize the fraternity to create connections to each other, to the campus, to the black community, and within the labor market.  It connects these findings to Tintos (1993) theory of college student departure and has implications for the development of retention programs on predominantly white campuses and the need to support the efficacy of these organizations as one form of ethnic enclave (Murguia 1991)"
0,"Inequality, family and school characteristics were linked to student achievement as shown by multi-level analyses of 107,975 15 year olds' mathematics tests and questionnaires in 41 countries. Equal distribution of country and school resources were linked to higher mathematics scores. Students scored higher in families or schools with more resources (SES, native born, two parents, more educational materials, higher SES schoolmates, female schoolmates, class time, educated teachers) or beneficial intangible processes (communication, discipline, teacher-student relationships). Students living with grandparents or siblings (especially older ones) scored lower. Physical family resource variables showed similar results across countries, supporting the social reproduction hypothesis for physical resources. In richer countries, intangible processes had stronger links with mathematics achievement, suggesting that greater availability of public physical resources raises the value of complementary intangible processes, which can help explain the Heyneman-Loxley effect of stronger family effects in richer countries."
0,"This paper empirically tests how employers allocate bonus compensation toward MBAs with “focused profiles”.  Leveraging sociological theory, we create a new construct that measures the degree of continuity across an MBA graduate’s activities and experiences prior to the MBA program, during the program, and upon job offer that is presented to employing firms.  We then assess how these employing firms vary in their designation of variable compensation – in the form of discretionary bonuses offered to MBA graduates – when graduates have or do not have a focused profile.   Based on a rich dataset of two graduating cohorts in 2008 and 2009 from an elite graduate school program, we find that individuals who construct focused profiles earn lower bonuses.  This effect is consistent regardless of whether the focus is in investment banking, marketing, or finance.  In demonstrating this penalty associated with focused profiles, we inform literature on early managerial careers and sociological theory related to identity."
0,"In this paper, we examine the question of whether religion-affiliation, beliefs, and practice-provides a source Of Marital strength and stability in the lives of American couples. Unlike most previous studies, we focus on religion and marital quality among 433 low-income married couples with co-residential minor children, using recently collected survey data on both spouses sampled in the Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS). Our working hypothesis is that religiosity is a positive force for marital quality among low-income couples, and that a practicing faith can buffer the negative effects of economic stress on marital quality. The results indicate that most low-income couples have unexpectedly high scores on the various dimensions of marital quality (e.g., commitment, emotional support, etc.). Religious affiliation and personal religious beliefs are less important for marital quality than if couples share similar beliefs about God's divine plans for them and their relationship, if they pray together, or if they attend religious services together. On the other hand, the stress-buffering hypothesis received little support in our analysis. At a minimum, the results clearly highlight the potential role of religion in the marital lives of low-income couples. The implication is that faith-based organizations (including churches and synagogues) may have a particularly strong role to play in nurturing the spiritual lives and enhancing the quality of the intimate marital relationships of their flocks.

0,"As with other forms of care work, animal foster care (AFC), too, requires emotion work.  In this paper I explore the emotional labor experienced by five women who provide temporary homes for homeless animals and process pet adoptions.  I identify four key emotion management strategies used by AFC workers: (1) establishing boundaries and meaning, (2) telling stories, (3) narrowing ones focus, and (4) enlisting others in the adoption process.  Furthermore, I briefly explore the contextualization of emotion management in AFC, noting how emotion management strategies can change between different foster care experiences as well as over the course of a given fostering experience.  Finally, emotions and emotion management are complex phenomena and undoubtedly there are many more strategies used by AFC workers.  To highlight this, I briefly explore the applicability of emotion management strategies in the caring field of medicine to that of AFC."
0,"Between 1974 and 2008, the Religious Right, a right wing movement involved in anti-gay politics, has placed 119 anti-gay referendums and initiatives on the ballot. Catapulted against their will into ballot issue politics the 1970s, the LGBT movement has learned to fight these referendums and initiatives with increasingly sophisticated, professional and expensive ballot issue campaigns. This paper examines the undertheorized and yet significant relationship between ballot issue campaigns and the LGBT movement at a time in which social movements are increasingly using the referendum and initiative process to enact social change. This paper is part of a larger historical study of LGBT ballot issue campaigns using a combination of archival data and interviews with over 80 local campaign activists and national campaign trainers, along with attending national campaign trainings. This paper examines the reiterative relationship between ballot issue campaigns from three different perspectives: the ways that professional ballot issue campaigns are “made” by social movements through their coordination by national organizations; the processes by which ephemeral ballot issue campaigns are transformed into lasting social movement resources; and, lastly, the ways that the instrumental tactics used by ballot issue campaigns undermine social movement goals."
0,"In this paper, I argue that pharmacological research on antipsychotics and the metabolic syndrome is a site for the technoscientific transformation of race.  The metabolic syndrome is a new biomedical classification whose meanings and applications vary widely across research contexts.  These new intersections of professional psychiatry, government psychiatric epidemiology, and pharmaceutical capitalism have created a context in which constructions of the metabolic syndrome are used to target particular raced bodies and racial populations in the contexts of pharmaceutical research and development on antipsychotics. Schizophrenia researchers use the metabolic syndrome as a way of analyzing the adverse side effects of atypical antipsychotics in racially categorized populations. I analyze the technoscientific, economic, and political forces that shape the production of knowledge about African Americans drug metabolism of antipsychotics.  In particular, I deconstruct the theories of race that are deployed to ask questions about African Americans drug metabolism of antipsychotics.  I show how drug researchers use conceptions of race, metabolism, and schizophrenia in antipsychotics research in ways that transform administrative taxonomies of race into biological and genetic taxonomies of race."
0,"Using structural equation modeling we examined the determinants of family emotional climate and its long-term impact on children's academic achievement and classroom behavior at the end of 5th grade. We employed the ECLS-K data a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. elementary school students. Family emotional climate was measured in the spring of kindergarten and included three dimensions: parental depression, parental warmth, and use of physical discipline. Main findings: low SES, Black and single parents were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Black parents were more likely to use physical discipline, but they also reported greater parental warmth. Asian parents were less likely to use physical discipline, but also were less likely to express parental warmth. Parental depression was associated with increased use of physical discipline and reduced parental warmth. Parental depression, measured in kindergarten, was associated with lower reading and math achievement and lower approaches to learning at the end of 5th grade. Use of physical discipline in kindergarten was associated with lower 5th-grade math achievement. "
0,"This paper is a case study analysis of the sociological phenomena of forgiveness occurring in an ongoing two-decade war in northern Uganda. Building on a long-term relationship with the region and utilizing the methods of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and a qualitative questionnaire, I identify two especially important social mechanisms that correlate with the prevalence of forgiveness discourse amongst the Acholi people of northern Uganda: (1) a communal sense of war fatigue and (2) a sense of Acholi collective identity, which the religious and cultural leaders have emphasized to promote a pervasive public dialogue of forgiveness. While recognizing that forgiveness in northern Uganda is contested, findings from my study point to how forgiveness opens a space for some Acholi to assert power and express agency in their lives after years of being portrayed largely as victims. Furthermore, forgiveness also offers the opportunity for some Acholi to experience interpersonal empowerment by maintaining a locus of control through meaning-making."

Carnival spaces become increasingly necessary within highly commercialized, consumed and commodified societies.  Such societies create daily lives that are empty of deep, fulfilling content.  Carnival spaces provide individuals with controlled hedonistic experiences without threatening or attempting to overthrow the society.  In fact, such spaces facilitate the growth of commodified societies since participants can easily escape during carnival to another highly consumed and commercialized culture, and return to their work or school life once it is over.  Based on 45 different observations at a variety of clubs and venues along the East Coast of the US (totaling 200 hours in the field) from March 2004 and June 2005, and 18 in depth tape-recorded interviews of club kids  (club drug users who frequent dance venues) encountered in the field , this paper will describe the carnival.  Paying particular attention to the party themes, music, lighting effects, dancing styles and drug use at clubbing spaces, I will illustrate how clubbing  provides a temporary escape based on excess, transgression and concentrated on fun."
0,"This is the first phase of a larger research project funded in part by a grant from Stephen F. Austin State University to investigate adverse selection in U.S. counties with declining population.  Adverse selection refers to the notion that the lack of economic opportunities in declining rural communities provides incentive for those individuals with the most education, skills, and experience to seek employment elsewhere.  Often, this leaves those with the least education, skills, and experience.  This is important because decisions about community development are logically linked to the qualifications and abilities of the communitys members who make them.  In this analysis I address data from all us counties to investigate the relationship between declining population and social concerns such as poverty, educational attainment, age structure, and crime.  This is a preliminary analysis that will provide the foundation for an in depth case study to be conducted in Brown County, Kansas (a declining rural community) during the summer of 2006."
0,"This article offers a theoretical and methodological system for a sociological analysis of the restless nature of historical events. This system, political semiosis, is able to identify and assess the performative speech acts, the demonstrative orientational specifications, and the mimetic representations required to advance historical transformations. The features of political semiosis structure the flow of historical events by managing the specific media and generic forms that are the vehicles through which events take shape. Political semiosis provides a method for analyzing both the circulation and the materialization of events. The exemplary case of September 11 illuminates this approach's capabilities."
0,"Drawing conceptions from the fiscal-military model of state formation in which wars make states, I explore what made the historical experiences of Taiwan different from early Europe and contemporary Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. I argue that properly applying Charles Tillys analysis of coercion and capital of European state formation to the case of Taiwan in the Cold-War era entails a revised notion of the military. That the military was mainly composed of refugee-soldiers rather than citizen-soldiers is a factor setting Taiwans state-building process apart. Exiled Mainland soldiers defeated in the Chinese civil war were the main body of the military. Moreover, I suggest that foreign aid and domestic resources were the two sources of capital in non-European state making. Unlike its Latin American and African counterparts that relied heavily on foreign aid, the state in Taiwan balanced the two sources. While it had to negotiate with the society to extract resources, foreign aid exempted it from taking too much. Establishing negotiating mechanisms with the society that didnt burden it too much, the state in Taiwan became more capable and effective."
0,"Emphasizing the concept of an identity struggle, this paper describes the differences between multiracial adolescents with jobs and single race adolescents with jobs. Literature in field of multiracial and identity studies, indicate that multiracial adolescents are more likely to engage in substance and tobacco use compared to single race counterparts. Furthermore, being employed and having an income affect the purchase and use of alcohol and drugs in the adolescent population. A factorial MANOVA on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Waves I-III was used to determine differences between populations and indicators of current risk behavior were assessed using 30 day response variables; all data was analyzed with SAS 9.1. Results show across all waves of data, multi-race adolescents engage in risky health behaviors more than single race counterparts. Statistically significant results were found for comparisons between multiracial and African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. Thus, given the growing population of the multi-race population in the United States it is imperative to continue to investigate the behaviors of this specialized demographic to create social and health programs aimed specifically at this target group and to further investigate how and why this population is more likely to engage in risky behaviors."
0,"Much research has examined the link between ascriptive characteristics (e.g., gender and/or race) and important employee career outcomes such as wage growth, promotions, and terminations.  There is also a large lab- and field-based literature on the topic of performance evaluation bias.  However, all these studies presume that todays organizations are meritocratic, and consequently that a significant positive relationship between performance, wage, and wage growth is institutionally valued and strongly supported.  If performance evaluation works the way advocates of meritocracy claim, then including performance ratings in any empirical models should explain away the effect of any ascriptive characteristics on wage growth.  In this article, I examine whether evidence supports the meritocratic claim in a special setting with unique data. In this setting, supervisors evaluate employees using dyadic performance evaluations, and these evaluations constitute the primary source of salary increases over time.  Although there is no evidence that gender, race, or nationality accounts for any differences in starting annual salaries within a given occupation in a given work unit, I still find that certain organizational decisions produce important wage inequality outcomes over employees tenures: Observationally equivalent women and men, for example, obtain unequal salary increases over time, even after they are given the same performance evaluation.  These findings are robust after controlling for the process of turnover."
0,"Religious fundamentalism is conceived as a distinctive set Of beliefs and attitudes toward one's religion, including obedience to religious norms, belief in the universality and immutability of its principles, the validity of its claims, and its indispensability for human happiness. Surveys of Egyptian and Saudi youth, ages 18-25, reveal that respondents with higher levels of fundamentalism are more likely to rely on religious authorities as the source of knowledge about the sociopolitical role of Islam, support religious law, be fatalistic, and feel insecure. They are also less likely to watch TV Saudi females are more fundamentalist than males, but in Egypt, the opposite held true. Country-specific effects are present, and there are implications for future research."
0,"Collective memory quite naturally brings to mind notions of mnemonic speech and representation. In this article, however, we propose that collective silences be thought of as a rich and promising arena through which to understand how groups deal with their collective pasts. In so doing, we explore two types of silence: overt silence and covert silence, and suggest that each may be used to enhance either memory or forgetting. We illustrate our conceptual scheme using data on the commemoration of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin."

While people may be more interconnected to those with whom they share common interests, the physical aspect of human interaction is not possible upon initial contact. The analysis of three websites: Facebook.com, Datemypet.com, and WetCanvas.com, will help to explore the ways in which people use the internet as a source of communication and interaction. Using the perspectives of Goffman and Myers, the way in which people work to develop their sense of self through online presentations can be observed and studied. While it is difficult to know what information is falsified and what information is true, there are some patterns in which people present themselves in a certain manner as they are being judged in a virtual public arena."
0,"What it means to be a nurse has changed over time. This article explores the changing meanings for the nurse role in a sample of Bachelor of Science nursing students by analyzing 30 nurse role attributes documented in the nursing literature. Students' perceptions of obligatory and self-in-role meanings are assessed, and multiple role meaning dimensions are identified. Identity-discrepancy theory is used to determine whether discrepancies between obligatory and self-in-role meanings are related to role satisfaction. Findings suggest that discrepancies in some nurse role meaning dimensions are predictive of role satisfaction. The implications for role exit and the nursing shortage are discussed."
0,"This paper is for the most part expository of Pierre Bourdieus thinking regarding the state.  Presenting Bourdieus thinking about the state seems appropriate at this time since his political sociology is not well known in North America, particularly his thinking regarding the state.  The sociology of Pierre Bourdieu has certainly had a significant impact on contemporary thought and research in American sociology, particularly in the subfields of culture and education, but also in stratification and social theory.  Less well understood, however, is his political sociology particularly with regard to the role of government in the stratification order.  This paper attempts to address this important lacuna in American understanding of this leading European social scientist.  It identifies the key influence of Max Weber on Bourdieus  thinking and notes the point where Bourdieu believes he moves beyond Weber.  The paper also identifies how Bourdieus thinking regarding the state is an extension of his broader  sociology of culture, particularly his conceptualization of symbolic power, of class struggles as classification struggles, and his field analysis."
0,"Despite dramatic changes in education and occupational opportunities for Blacks in the United States, facilitated by affirmative action policies, the White-Black earnings' gap has not vanished. Although the literature on this issue has become substantial no one has yet provided a systematic examination of changes in the earnings' gap that takes into consideration the concomitant changes in the occupational structure and changes in the racial composition of occupational labor markets as well as changes in characteristics of the labor force. In the present research, we use 5 waves of IPUMS data and hierarchical linear modeling to estimate changes in the effect of race on earnings between 1960 and 2000. The models focus on the interaction of time and race with earnings while controlling for individual-level characteristics (i.e. education) at the individual-level and the characteristics of detailed occupational labor markets (i.e. occupational socioeconomic status, race and gender composition, occupational earnings inequality) at the aggregate level. In order to evaluate the effect of change over time, both linear and non-linear trends in earning gaps are estimated in the labor market as a whole and separately for the public and private sectors. The data reveal that net of changes in the occupational distributions and market-relevant characteristics of Black and White men, the gaps have generally narrowed but at a declining rate. The data also reveal considerable differences in racial earnings inequality between the public and the private sectors. Whereas the unexplained earnings gap in the public sector has virtually vanished by 2000, in the private sector, the gap is still significant, although it declined over time. The findings are discussed in light of past research in order to re-evaluate the contribution of labor market attributes and sector differences to change in earnings disparities between Black and White men in the US.

0,"This paper is a respecification of counting as an achievement, as localized social and material work rather than a universally understood just so, or a uniform mathematical practice that can be applied unambiguously to any number of counting situations. The activity of human chromosome counting, from the late 1800s to 1956, provides an apt frame through which to examine counting as an epistemic topic.  From E.B Wilsons The Cell in Development and Inheritance, 1896, we learn that, in man the number is said to be 16, and the same number is characteristic of the onion.   By 1954, after the number had held steady for thirty years, Sachs declared that the diploid chromosome number of 48 in man can therefore now be considered as an established fact.   Any textbook since 1956 assures us that there are 46 chromosomes in the normal human cell nucleus.  I will show, with detailed reference to the vexed history of chromosome counting, that the work of making objects countable, of preparing the field for this seemingly simple assignment of arithmetic numbers, and of convincing relevant communities that a count is certain, is inexorably context-bound, social, contingent, and anchored in relevant knowledge projects.  Moreover, the labor required to render entities countable does epistemic work: counted objects acquire properties, such as individuality and membership in a group, which they did not have prior to the counting."
0,"This paper relies on an analysis of original historical documents to explain the political origins of an 1839 law regulating the factory employment of children in Prussia. The paper has two aims. First, it seeks to explain why Prussia adopted the particular law that it did. Existing historical explanations of this particular policy change are incorrect, largely because they fail to take into account the actual motivations and intentions of key reformers. The success of the “winning” child labor policy proposal can be attributed to institutional constraints and a changing political environment, and to how these “structural” factors interacted with its proponents’ use of ideational strategies to attract political allies. Second, the paper seeks to contribute to the theoretical literature on the role of ideas in public policymaking. I argue that ideas serve as motivators by inspiring political action and constituting policy goals, and I offer a theory of the relationship between ideas, motivation, and political action which incorporates insights from Weber. I also develop a new methodological framework for assessing the reliability of political actors’ expressed motivations. In addition to motivating political action, ideas also serve as strategic resources actors use to convince others of the merit of their policy plans. By tracing how different understandings of the child labor problem motivated and were embodied in the two competing proposals, I show how the ideas underlying Prussian child labor reform had significant consequences for policy outcomes."
0,"A specific type of third sector organization has proliferated across the global South in recent years: the community-based organization (CBO).  CBOs are usually formed by and for individuals residing in a geographically bounded area with the express purpose of providing services and/or improving the environment.  Research on CBOs has flourished as academics, government officials, and development professionals have sought more effective and efficient organizational forms for the delivery of public goods and services.  Two prominent perspectives have emerged in the literature.  The first claims that market transactions are the key to successful service delivery, and that CBOs have a role to play as service providers and as demanders of accountability.  The second argues that the provision of public goods and services requires ""synergy"" between CBOs and a variety of external actors; i.e., CBOs and other stakeholders, primarily the state, complement one another by contributing different and necessary inputs.  Neither perspective adequately considers the causal mechanisms that produce these organizations.  This paper investigates two causal mechanisms  formalization and subsidiarity in the context of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  The paper argues that while both mechanisms have influenced the rapid growth of CBOs and the influenced the form they take, each is at odds with the two main approaches to community involvement in the delivery of critical services; i.e., they preclude the formation of both the horizontal ties emphasized in the market-based approach and the complementary, vertical ties central to ""state-society synergy."""
0,"We investigate the social and behavioral characteristics Of male adolescents who self-identify as players, focusing particularly on Anderson claim that this social role is inextricably linked with poverty and minority status. Results indicate that black respondents, those affiliated with liberal peers and young men who initially report a relatively high number of sexual partners are more likely to resonate with this identity label. Nevertheless, analyses reveal that a number of players within the sample are not disadvantaged black youth, and there is considerable variability in their attitude and behavior profiles. Findings based on longitudinal analyses indicate that the player identity is a significant predictor of later variations in self-reported sexual behavior, net of traditional predictors, including prior behavior. Yet results of in-depth interviews conducted with a subset of the respondents complicate these quantitative findings, highlighting that young mend perceptions of this identity are not as uniformly positive as Anderson depiction might lead us to expect."
0,"This paper considers the similarities between the cosmetic surgery and tattoo industries and focuses on how each has transitioned itself from a disreputable and deviant industry to achieve varying degrees of mainstream acceptance and success.  Using Event Structure Analysis, I model and compare the development of each industry based on linear historical narratives.  The resulting models illustrate the importance of events within the narrative along with their relationship to each other.  Findings suggest that the creation of industry-wide professional organizations is integral to changing the public perception of a given industry.  Furthermore, findings show that the more hierarchical structure of the cosmetic surgery industry, as well as its integration into the medical industry, have helped it to thrive in a manner that contrasts sharply with the more disorganized structure of the tattoo industry."
0,"The prevailing question in this paper is how is the Colombian government able to wield human rights rhetoric to garner international support to put pressure on the FARC while the abuses against internally displaced, poor, labor union, and refugee populations go comparatively unnoticed? The paper will explicate the Colombian government’s selective use of human rights rhetoric and explore how although resolving the hostage crisis is certainly an important facet of resolving the humanitarian situation in Colombia, the human right crisis is driven mainly by extreme structural inequality. The analysis will conclude with ideas about why the government’s framing of the human rights crisis has resonated stronger in the international community than that of the dozens of human rights organizations that have been working in the country for decades."
0,"Scholars differ in their assumptions about the strength of accumulated evidence concerning social learning theory. One area of potential weakness is a possible dearth of evidence regarding differential reinforcement, the theory's central causal mechanism. We report results from a systematic review of (1) a sample of experimental studies concerning human reinforcement learning as well as (2) criminological/sociological studies cited by proponents as supportive of social learning theory. This review is designed to assess the empirical basis for reinforcement and social learning. It suggests that results of experimental research, though supportive of the reinforcement process, may be limited in applicability to social learning theory's hypotheses regarding differential reinforcement, and direct tests of differential reinforcement hypotheses are rare in the non-experimental literature. We conclude that the strength of social learning theory could be enhanced by more thorough and direct testing of reinforcement hypotheses and we offer suggestions about how to accomplish that."
0,"Growing attention is being paid to the generational differences in the work orientations of professionals, particularly among Baby Boomers and Generation Xers. It is suggested that the role that work plays in ones life is the most significant generational difference, where Generation Xers are viewed as less committed to work, careers and employers than Baby Boomers. Most of this literature however is supported at best by anecdotal evidence rather than empirical data This paper empirically addresses two questions: (1) Are Generation X lawyers less committed to their work than Baby Boomer lawyers? and (2) Do the factors related to work commitment differ for Generation X lawyers and Baby Boomers lawyers? The results show there is no significant generational difference in work commitment. The generations do differ in the factors related to their work commitment however. Work effort and extrinsic rewards are generally more highly related to Baby Boomers commitment and intrinsic rewards to Generation Xers work commitment."
0,"We investigate the frequency, types, and psychological correlates of both major and day-to-day interpersonal discrimination experienced by underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese Americans. Analyses are based on data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a national population survey of more than 3,000 adults ages 25 to 74 in 1995. Severely obese persons (Body Mass Index > 35) are significantly more likely to report experiences of major discrimination (including employment and health-care related discrimination) as well as day-to-day interpersonal discrimination. Among the severely obese, professional workers are more likely than non-professionals to report employment discrimination and interpersonal mistreatment. Severely obese persons report significantly lower levels of self-acceptance than persons with normal weight, yet this relationship is fully mediated by the perception that one has been discriminated against due to body weight or physical appearance. Our findings offer further support for the pervasive stigma of obesity, and for the reflected appraisals perspective on self. Although obesity is increasingly common in the United States, obese persons are still subject to important forms of institutional and interpersonal mistreatment."
0,"Ronald Coases (1937) seminal work seemed to open the door wide for a sociological understanding of the firm by arguing that firms and markets relied on different means of governance  -- the market on price, the firm on authority.  Yet this view has never been developed.  Despite attempts to pursue Coases formulation, economists continue to model the firm as a sub-economy governed by the internal price mechanism; sociologists, intent on showing the social embeddedness of all economic action, have likewise neglected the systematic differences between firm and market.  This paper returns to the Coasean formulation, arguing that the firms unique character lies in the fact that it relies extensively on a wide array of non-price motivators to achieve internal order.  There are three related parts to this argument.  First, I show that, despite their best intentions, economic theories of the firm continually model authority in the firm as a form of price.  Second, I argue that the firms ability to generate and sustain normative commitments is anchored in social and especially legal institutions.  Third, I extend this point to examine the ways in which the law creates systematic differences between firm and market in terms of their abilities to rely on normative motivators."
0,"Data from the New Immigrant Survey are used to study wealth differentials among U.S. legal permanent residents. This study is unique in its ability to account for wealth held in the U.S. and that held abroad and yields several key findings. First, relative to immigrants from Western Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (who have median wealth similar to native born non-Hispanic whites), other immigrant groups have lower levels of total wealth even after accounting for permanent income and life course characteristics. Second, time in the U.S. is positively associated with the wealth of married immigrants, yet this relationship is not statistically significant for single immigrants. Third, differences in the means of measured characteristics between Western European immigrants and those from most other origin regions account for more than 75 percent of observed wealth disparities. However, for immigrants from Asia and from the Indian subcontinent, much of the wealth differential remains unexplained by these factors. "
0,"Unable to make individuals pay for services, many Voluntary organizations are burdened with members paying little or nothing for their involvement. An extensive research literature has argued that demanding religious congregations increase organizational resources by screening out free-riders. This explanation focuses oil membership selection and the effect of individual beliefs and commitment. Building on the implications of previous Work we argue that congregational requirements do more than just screen-out the least committed; they also serve to increase the production of those who join. Using multi-level data we find that organizational monitoring and sanctioning interact with individual beliefs and involvement to explain financial giving to religious congregations. We Conclude that high organizational demands not only serve to select members who are the most willing to give, they generate organizational properties that increase the contributions of those who join. In short, sanctions ensure that individuals do not believe without contributing, while monitoring ensures that individuals do not participate without contributing. "
0,"In industrialized nations, sibship size generally depresses educational attainment: the larger the number of siblings, the lower the educational attainment. This association is much less consistent in developing nations, however. This article examines the effect that the number of siblings has on educational attainment in China, a nation that has experienced sharp vacillations between policies designed to promote equality (between urban and rural residents and between men and women) and policies designed to promote economic development. The implementation of these policies in the educational arena has alternately reduced and increased competition for educational resources and, as we show, has correspondingly reduced and increased the effect of sibship size on educational attainment."
0,"Using  a recently available wave of the large, nationally representative sample of U.S. students––Early Childhood Longitudinal Study – Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS–K) data, this study  examined whether early parental educational expectations and early employed parental cultural practices (during kindergarten and first grade years) affect children’s emerging habitus (conceptualized as educational expectations and self- concept) when they reach adolescence, as well as their academic achievement in 8th grade. Findings: Students from higher SES families had more positive self-concept, higher educational expectations and higher academic achievement. Higher parental educational expectations were positively associated with all studied outcomes. Early parental school involvement was associated with adolescents’ more positive self-concept and higher educational expectations in 8th grade. Having more children’s books at home was associated with higher math and reading achievement in 8th grade. Early participation in extra-curricular activities and educational trips showed no significant association with adolescents’ outcomes. The paper discusses theoretical and empirical implications, as well as future directions for the study of habitus."
0,"Data on 82 commercial banks which operated in India between 2004 and 2009 were analyzed to show that higher status banks were more prone to misconduct in loan recovery than banks of lower status. The data support the proposition that when quality is easily observable, the risk of slipping down the status hierarchy entails disproportionate losses for high status organizations, which motivates them to resort to misconduct. At the same time, their high status position provides them leeway to do so, as they can attach a disclaimer to their misconduct, describing it as a measure to improve quality. High status banks that had a pronounced social orientation or which received negative media attention were less likely to engage in illegal recovery practices."
0,"Existing sociological theories highlight five explanations of development, which focus on leftist political parties in state power, women's office-holding, state capacity, social capital and resource mobilization, and state expenditure. Increasingly, however, the execution of development schemes by large democratic states of the global South relies on citizen participation in what I define as Redistributive Direct Democracy (RDD). RDD institutions devolve formal authorities and create political opportunities for participants to themselves allocate and claim development benefits. Within India's approximately two million local governments, a permanent RDD institution called the gram sabha offers all participants the formal, constitutional authority to directly select recipients of state benefits such as public housing and latrines. Drawing on fixed-effects, multivariate OLS analyses of data collected in a stratified random sample of 72 Indian local governments with active gram sabhas, I argue for a sixth, complementary explanation of development in democracies of the global South: women's participation in RDD. My analysis demonstrates strongly positive and highly significant effects of women's gram sabha participation on local development and a contrasting absence of support for longstanding explanations. These findings suggest that women's participation in RDD can make these new and popular, but poorly understood institutions matter for development outcomes."
0,"Research has shown that victims of childhood physical and emotional abuse experience a continuity of negative outcomes well into adulthood, including mental health problems, increased risk for domestic violence, and occupational difficulties.  One possible explanation for this continuity may be that child maltreatment results in a reduced sense of control.  Victims may be less likely to avoid or remedy problems in their lives because they see themselves as having little control.  I explore the viability of reduced control as an explanation for this continuity by using a national probability sample of adults to examine the effects of physical and emotional child maltreatment by parents on perceived control.  Importantly, the effects of child maltreatment are examined both for overall sense of control, and also sense of control over several distinct domains of life.  This allows for an examination of whether reduced perceived control may be more useful as an explanation for continuity regarding some outcomes than others.  I find that, for both men and women, child maltreatment results in reduced perceived control across a range of domains.  Maternal abuse is shown to affect only women, while paternal abuse affects both genders.  The breadth of the effects of maltreatment on sense of control suggests that reduced sense of control may be an explanation for the effects of physical and emotional maltreatment across a range of outcomes well into adulthood.  However, this explanation may apply more for abuse experienced by women than abuse experienced by men.  Possible reasons for these differences are discussed."
0,"Many theories in the sociology of emotions assume that emotions emerge from the cognitive consistency principle. Congruence among cognitions produces good feelings whereas incongruence produces bad feelings. A work situation is simulated in which managers give feedback to workers that is consistent or inconsistent with what the workers expect to get from their performance. Workers' emotional reactions are then obtained. The power and status of the managers is investigated. The findings reveal that how much time workers have to process their performance feedback, and the power and status of the managers, influence workers to feel good about feedback that is inconsistent with their expectations. These findings are consistent with the enhancement process. We suggest that the enhancement process be included in sociology theories on emotions."
0,"Although many sociologists are strongly wedded to the idea of ""social construction,"" the contextual factors that influence the magnitude of construction are rarely considered. This article explores the decoupling of an actor's status from the actor's underlying quality and examines the factors that influence the magnitude of decoupling. The authors specifically consider the role of quality uncertainty, diffuse status characteristics, and the self-fulfilling prophecy. To analyze the impact of each mechanism on decoupling, they simulate the evolution of thousands of small groups using a dyadic model of status allocation. The authors discuss the results of these simulations and conclude with the implications for future research and the practical management of groups."
0,"This study explores the relationships between household-level and community-level U.S. migration experience and individual-level infant mortality outcomes in Mexico. Household-level and community-level migration prevalence are hypothesized to influence infant mortality in migrant-sending communities through resources and information remitted back home. Using 2000 Mexican Census data and multi-level regression models, we find that infants born to rural Mexican women receiving remittances from the U.S. had a significantly lower likelihood of mortality in their first year of life compared to infants born to rural Mexican women not receiving U.S. remittances. Infants born in rural households with one or two or five or more recent migrant trips had a higher likelihood of mortality in their first year of life compared to infants born to rural households with no recent migrant trips, whereas infants born in non-rural households with three or four recent migrant trip had a lower likelihood of mortality relative to infants born in non-rural households with no recent migrant trips. Community migration prevalence is associated with a lower risk of infant mortality in rural places."
0,"This research contributes to discussions about social inequality in school choices in two ways.  First, educational choices include the multitude of options families may consider including choosing a home in a particular area and home-schooling, and not at a single point in time, but over childrens education careers. Second, this research explores school choices across school district boundaries to include school choices in suburban and rural districts, as well as urban districts.  I use unique data from a representative sample of 390 families with school-aged children living in Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Metropolitan area to explore the options that families consider for their childrens schooling.  The data paint a picture of two groups: one, white, suburban, and middle-income, that primarily selects schools through residences and another, non-white, lower-income, and urban, that relies more on non-neighborhood school options.   The differences in the types of options these two groups consider suggests that the expanded school choice policies of urban school districts will have little influence on overall school inequality because the option to choose neighborhood public schools through residences remains prevalent among advantaged suburban whites."
0,"Recently, the idea that a ""postracial"" identity is the new route to success for African Americans has become en vogue. Our paper challenges that argument using both qualitative and quantitative data from Black students at selective colleges and universities and considers a more nuanced and multidimensional understanding of Black racial identity, including the impact of ethnic background and nativity status on racial identification. While the students are strongly assimilationist, race is also a strong component of their self-identity. Further, ""postracial"" identification was associated with lower grades and not associated with any change in student satisfaction with their college experience. The paper considers how a more multidimensional and flexible understanding of racial identity and politics would improve our sociological understanding of how one's identity affects one's daily life."

0,"South Korea is emerging as a new destination for the migration rush from poorer Asian countries. As a way to respond to the growing visibility of foreigners and their cultures, the Korean government recently adopted multiculturalism as its principle of incorporating immigrants. Korea’s turn to multiculturalism is revolutionary in the sense that Korea has traditionally been a mono-cultural society based on a strong sense of ethnic homogeneity. The sudden acceptance of multiculturalism seems to signal that Korean society has finally given up its ethno-centric nationalism and is moving toward a multicultural society. However, closely looking into the phenomenon reveals an entirely different picture. This study attempts to objectively measure whether multiculturalism is institutionalized in Korea to the extent that we can call it a genuine multicultural society. Specifically, this study investigates multicultural policy in four dimensions: law, media, culture, and education. The results show that neither migrant workers nor marriage migrants, the two major sources of migration in Korea, are treated based on multicultural principles. What is strange though is that the Korean government still believes that it pursues a multicultural policy. This study seeks to answer the question of why the Korean government addresses immigration issue in this contradictory, self-deceitful way. Through archival research using various sources, I show that the Korean government utilizes multicultural rhetoric merely as a tool to enhance national images in the international community, but the specific contents of its multicultural policy are driven by nationalist preoccupations about the national interests and unity."
0,"In this article, I propose a three-stage estimation model to examine the effect of parental divorce on the development of children's cognitive skills and noncognitive traits. Using a framework that includes pre-, in-, and post-divorce time periods, I disentangle the complex factors affecting children of divorce. I use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class 1998 to 1999 (ECLS-K), a multiwave longitudinal dataset, to assess the three-stage model. To evaluate the parameters of interest more rigorously, I employ a stage-specific ordinary least squares (OLS) model, a counterfactual matching estimator, and a piece-wise growth curve model. Within some combinations of developmental domains and stages, in particular from the in-divorce stage onward, I find negative effects of divorce even after accounting for selection factors that influence children's skills and traits at or before the beginning of the dissolution process. These negative outcomes do not appear to intensify or abate in the ensuing study period."
0,"Using ethnographic work with the Sudanese political opposition in London in relation to the Darfur crisis, this paper looks at the emergence of new political subjects in complex urban environments. I argue for a theoretical and methodological approach that utilizes boundaries as a heuristic for understanding the way that political interests now intersect in complex and almost anarchic ways as transnational flows embed themselves in urban space. Through a processual model, this paper will look at how such actors make their claims legible in the city. It will also develop a new model for understanding how new political subjectivities come into play and how subjects navigate between formal and informal realms of political practice."
0,"Previous literature on moral reform has, with some notable exceptions, focused on the generation of moralistic sentiment, rather than the rhetoric through which it is deployed. This analysis adds an important coda to this literature by drawing further attention to the distinction between content and style when assessing moral-reform arguments. Examining every argument ( N = 540) made against a pornographic business in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1969 to 1997, as indexed by articles in the city's major newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it argues that the tendency to frame antipornography arguments in instrumental terms exists throughout the years of the study, but it becomes more pronounced over time. A compelling explanation for the shift in rhetoric is that individuals still valued morality in the 1980s and 1990s but framed their arguments in ways that maximized their efficacy, policy wise. Implications of these findings for broader sociological issues are discussed."
0,"In recent years more legal immigrants have entered the United States through marriage than through any other means, while the desirability of current levels and types of immigration has been a matter of controversy. The United States has also been engaged in a heated public debate over the nature and definition of marriage for the past decade. The source of this debate has been the question of whether the legal status of marriage should be extended to same-sex couples. In this study, we want to point out that these two controversies, over immigration policy and over sexuality and marriage, are, in fact, closely connected. First, we observe that sexuality was historically an explicit basis for the exclusion or inclusion of immigrants. Next, we argue that the changes in U.S. immigration reform of 1965 made sexuality an implicit basis for entry by making heterosexual marriage the primary avenue for migration to the United States. Then, we maintain that American attitudes toward same-sex relations in general, and toward same-sex marriage in particular, have become increasingly polarized at the same time that controversies over immigration have intensified. Moreover, these two controversies are statistically connected in attitudes, as well as connected in history and policy: Attitudes toward same-sex marriage are related to attitudes toward immigration. Finally, we suggest that if same-sex marriage becomes a reality, polarization on both matters is likely mutually reinforcing, in the sense that polarization of attitudes toward marriage will intensify polarization of attitudes toward immigration and vice versa, with several important social consequences."
0,"For American Blacks, nativity in the South is positively related to increased rates of cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, functional disability, and all-cause mortality.  Scholars have hypothesized that nativity differences in health are a consequence of poor health behaviors. Among Blacks, however, differences in socioeconomic status attainment and exposure to racial discrimination may also help to explain differences in health.  This paper evaluates the proposition that differences in self-reported health between Southern born and Northern born blacks living in the North may be a consequence of birthplace differences in socioeconomic status attainment, exposure to racial discrimination, and health behaviors.  Drawing on data from 504 US born blacks aged 65 and older in the Aging, Stress, and Health Study, 2001-2002, results indicated that increased exposure to unfair treatment, over the life course, results in poorer health, net of socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and demographic factors.  Moreover, differences in socioeconomic status attainment account for the demonstrated differences in health between blacks from the South and those from other regions of the US.  Health researchers would therefore be advised to consider geographic origins, status attainment processes, and health behaviors when examining birthplace differences in health."
0,"Most people think about power in terms of powerful people, powerful institutions, or instances of control over others. However, social movements demonstrate that power relations can operate differently. Under some circumstances, unexpected groups of people who have been under the control of others, and perhaps had accepted the authority of others as legitimate, resist and take action on their own behalf. These occasions reveal the socially constructed myth that creates the basis for authority and control."
0,"This article examines citizens' support for democracy across forty-six nations. The authors use multilevel modeling and data from the World Values Survey and other sources to assess individuals' support for democracy in light of broader country-level factors as well as individual proclivities toward religion, politics and community. Findings suggest that the predominance of a particular religion in a nation does not influence individuals' views in and of itself. It does, however, matter when individuals' religious beliefs and practices as well as their civic engagement are taken into account. These factors, even in predominantly Muslim countries, appear to foster rather than hinder positive views towards democracy. But individuals seeking a prominent role for religion in government are likely to be substantially less supportive of democracy. Such antidemocratic attitudes appear countered in a citizenry where many are engaged in conventional political activities, have attained higher social statuses and reside in highly globalized states with Protestant or Muslim majorities and without a Communist legacy."
0,"I examine whether the effect of parents' education on children's educational achievement and attainment varies by family structure and, if so, whether this can be explained by differential parenting practices. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, I find that as parents' education increases, children in single mother families experience a lower boost in their achievement test scores, likelihood of attending any post-secondary schooling, likelihood of completing a 4-year college degree, and years of completed schooling relative to children living with both biological parents. Differences in parents' educational expectations, intergenerational closure, and children's involvement in structured leisure activities partially explain these status transmission differences by family structure. The findings imply that, among children with highly educated parents, children of single mothers are less likely to be highly educated themselves relative to children who grow up with both biological parents.

0,"Many fear a catastrophic HIV/AIDS crisis awaits Russia unless the Russian government makes the struggle against HIV/AIDS a top policy priority.  Based on survey data and individual and focus group interviews with Russian health officials and health care workers who deal with HIV/AIDS, we conclude the case for prioritizing HIV/AIDS will find little resonance in Russia.   HIV/AIDS is perceived to be just one aspect of the broader health crisis, and the health crisis is just one among many other crises that have befallen Russian society during the last decade.  This perception is reinforced by uncertainty about the diseases prevalence in Russia, the preponderance of intravenous drug users among Russian PLWHA, satisfaction with the governments current policies, and skepticism regarding efforts to increase policymakers concerns about HIV/AIDS.  Accordingly, the HIV/AIDS campaign in Russia should be integrated into a broader strategy to address Russias health crisis in all its aspects."
0,"This paper investigates the relationship between hourly wages and regional and ethnic concentration among Mexican American women. In particular, the focus is on Mexican Americans in the Southwest regions of the United States. The paper asks whether the reasons for the minority wage differentials can be traced to individual characteristics, to characteristics of the regions, or to differences in ethnic concentration. With a theoretical model incorporating human capital, regional, and ethnic concentration factors, the question is addressed using data from the, 1990 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). For comparative purposes, the paper presents analysis for African American women and Anglo women. The results provide evidence for the importance of place of residence, Mexican American women residing in areas of heavy Mexican American concentration in the Southwest, in which they have lower hourly wages than their Mexican American counterparts living in other regions. Finally, a cost of being a minority analysis indicates that African American women in these areas forego approximately $2.83 per hour of wages because of their race, whereas Mexican American women forego $1.30 per hour because of their ethnicity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results and policy implications."
0,"Using the 2008 Chicago Area Study, this article tests how residential context plays a role in welfare policy attitudes, controlling for individual level characteristics. The contextual level variables of household public assistance use and minority concentration in respondents' neighborhoods are tested using multinomial logistic regression analysis. When including controls for education, income, political party, age, employment status, gender, and race, respondents residing in neighborhoods with a higher concentration of African Americans are more likely to endorse positive attitudes toward welfare policy. Additionally, an interaction effect is found between individual level income and household public assistance use in the ZIP code when predicting welfare policy attitudes. Lower income respondents residing in neighborhoods with higher household public assistance use are more likely to endorse positive attitudes toward welfare than their higher income neighbors. Given the exploratory nature of this study, the author concludes with implications for such findings and proposes future research."
0,"In this paper, I use a life-course approach to examine young adults attitudes toward providing financial support to aging parents and toward letting aging parents live with them.  Using national data, I model the effects of returning to the parents home, as well as the relationship to the parent, on attitudes toward parental support.  I find marginally significant effects of returning to the parents home on attitudes toward support.  Additionally, relationship to the parent has an effect on attitudes toward support that differ by gender.  Daughters who are close to their father are more likely to support attitudes toward providing financial help, and sons who are close to their mother are more likely to support attitudes toward living with an aging parent."
0,"Research has increasingly focused on how ethnicity operates within labor markets.  Due to perceptions of ethnic solidarity and intra-group homogeneity, most research has neglected intra-group economic inequality.  This study examines how nativity/immigration status, gender, and skin color influence wage differentials in Latina/o co-ethnic niches.  I use data from the Los Angeles Study of Urban Inequality (LASUI) and improve upon previous conceptualizations of ethnic niches.  Consistent with expectations, results show that employment in co-ethnic niches is associated with wage penalties and that inequality factors namely nativity/immigration status, gender, and skin color stratify workers employed in these workplaces.  Contrary to previous conceptions of co-ethnic work environments as protective, this study finds persistent immigrant penalties and a gender wage gap among Latina/os working in co-ethnic niches.  Additionally, skin color segmentation among Latina/os working in co-ethnic niches predicts higher wage penalties for darker-complected workers."
0,"Parental social capital has emerged as an important social control component of adolescent delinquency. However, for severe forms of delinquency, such as violence, adolescent social capital is as likely a source of social control as adult social capital. This study uses the first two waves of the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to show that parental social capital has little effect on violence once parental and family characteristics are controlled. However, both neighborhood and school adolescent social capital reduce adolescents' violent behavior in spite of strong controls of peer fighting, prior violent offending, and neighborhood-level variables."
0,"This paper examines paternal involvement and child health and social-emotional behaviors for three-year old children living with four types of fathers: married biological fathers, cohabiting biological fathers, married social fathers, and cohabiting social fathers. I find no support for the hypothesis that social fathers are less involved than biological fathers with their co-resident children. However, I do find tentative support for the idea that children fare better in biological than in social father families in terms of aggressive behavior but not in terms of other outcomes. Children living with cohabiting biological parents consistently exhibit lower levels of aggressive behavior than do children living with two recently-married biological parents, suggesting that family instability may be more important than family structure for child wellbeing in biological father families. There are no significant differences identified in child wellbeing in married versus cohabiting social father families."
0,"Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian families have been undergoing a “quiet revolution.” Using ethnographic and interview data, my research analyzes the meaning of these profound family changes through the lens of single motherhood. Although single mothers have experienced social dislocation and real material hardship, surprisingly, most in no way consider themselves unusually poor and unfortunate (bednye i neschastnye). This paper focuses on one of the key reasons why: Grandmothers, in many cases, shore up these “fragile families” and reduce the effects of instability and poverty. An ideology of independent self-reliance (and a silence on the part of the state) tends to obscure the contributions of grandmothers, but babushki (grandmothers) are fundamental to single mothers’ relative success. In other words, single mothers may want a good man at their side -- but most instead need a grandmother -- to make it in the New Russia. The paper concludes by reflecting on the importance of (even non-resident) kin in shaping the experiences of families that fall outside the culturally dominant “two-parent” family ideal."
0,"Although multidisciplinary interest in musicultures, or subcultures formed around specific musical genres, has generated a large body of research, the emergent theoretical perspectives have been surprisingly limited. Few attempts have been made to determine what forces propel individuals to choose one musiculture over another, and even fewer studies address the reasons why some individuals retain their affiliations into adulthood. The aim of this paper is to survey the literature that exists on US musicultures and to demonstrate that a wider theoretical lens is necessary if we are to understand what musicultures mean to the people who affiliate with them. I break down existing research into four theoretical frameworks: music as a response; music as an influence; music as identity; and music as a status marker. Weaknesses in all four perspectives are identified. Finally, I illustrate how a combined methodological strategy will allow investigators to examine more sophisticated research questions, including why individuals choose to affiliate with the musicultures they do and why some may choose to remain in those communities over long periods of time."
0,"Picture books often play an important role in childhood socialization. Given the seriousness of environmental problems, we ask how natural, modified, and built environments have been portrayed in childrens books. To answer this question, we analyze the 296 books receiving Caldecott awards from 1938 to 2008. Two possibilities are explored with respect to content change. Growing concern about critical environmental problems, such as decline in biodiversity and deforestation, may have led to an increase in illustrations and stories about wild animals and the natural environment. Alternatively, the increasing isolation of people from the natural world may have resulted in a decline in the perceived relevance of these environmental issues and resulted in fewer stories and depictions. Our findings support the isolation hypothesis. There have been significant declines in depictions of natural environments and animals while built environments have become much more common. These findings suggest that todays generation of children are not being socialized, at least through this source, toward an understanding and appreciation of the natural world and the place of humans within it."
0,"Prior studies of perceived or realized employment insecurity have focused almost entirely on insecure workers human capital and other personal characteristics. No studies have tested whether the community context shapes perceived employment insecurity among adults, though prior theory and research suggests that life chances are influenced by community conditions and that perception and attitudes about opportunity are a vital link between contextual structural conditions and individual behaviors and outcomes. Focusing on individuals expressed concerns about losing a job, or their perceived likelihood of finding another job if they experienced job loss, I use newly available data collected specifically to understand the influences of neighborhoods on individual residents in Chicago. I also examine a more objective indicator of employment insecurity: whether an individual is currently looking for work. Findings obtained from multilevel regression models suggest that even net of an extensive array of individual characteristics, some community structural conditions and social processes are associated with residents perceived employment insecurity, and that these associations are in some cases stronger for African Americans, but that community conditions may be differentially linked to different aspects of employment insecurity."
0,"This paper provides a first-ever exploration of the relation between neighborhood socio-demographic characteristics and the location of businesses by sector in a wide range of United States cities.  Our study is distinguished from prior research by the fact that we use tract-level data for forty-one mid-sized cities located in twelve states across the U.S.  We find that neighborhood demographics are highly associated with the commercial activity in an area.  In particular, neighborhoods with high proportions of African American residents are notable for the overall lack of businesses in each of the measured sectors, even after controlling for level of disadvantage, density and rate of home ownership.  This relative lack of business activity in areas with high proportions of Black residents has important implications for the conditions of life in these communities."
0,"This article explores the concept of intersectionality in sports media contexts by examining the differential treatment of two recently resigned collegiate womens basketball coaches, Pokey Chatman and Rene Portland.  Specifically, the author draws upon articles and comments found on the internet where it is evident that these coaches unique identities formed around sexuality, race, and gender affected the way in which they were regarded by their respective athletic programs, the popular press, and the general public.  Further research considering how intersectionality affects athletes, coaches, and fans is necessary to address how ones personal characteristics intertwine to shape their experience in sport."
0,"Previous researchers have demonstrated that adolescents have better mental health when they are surrounded by many peers who share their racial backgrounds.  The effect is largely attributed to the ability of the social condition to promote a sense of belonging and reduce stigma when minority adolescents are concerned.  However, these previous studies are mostly based on the contrast between whites and blacks, and it is not clear whether Hispanics and Asians benefit from having similar peers.  Also, previous researchers only considered racial composition at school, but adolescents may develop friendship circles, whose racial composition may be very different from school composition.  Consequently, little is known about how racial composition of friendship circles influences emotional states.  I examine these questions by analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=11,023).  Sense of belonging to school and depressive symptoms are considered as possible emotional outcomes.  Consistent with previous studies, the analysis showed that having friends and peers with the same racial backgrounds was related to a stronger sense of belonging, but the relationship only applied to white and black students.  The lack of this effect for Hispanics and Asians was likely due to the overall small size of these groups in many schools, which did not make having same-race friendships meaningful.  In fact, for all racial groups, the relationship between same-race friendships and belonging was stronger when the school had more students who shared racial backgrounds.  The analysis also showed that the effects of friendship network and school composition on depressive symptoms were very weak, except that Asian adolescents had more depressive symptoms when they were surrounded by Asian peers and friends.  I argue that Asians unique motivations for same-race friendships may account for this unexpected finding."
0,"This paper examines how gender, caste, class, ethnicity, and kinship operate and function inside the world of carpet factories in Nepal. The paper is based on the research ""Women in Factory-based and Home-based Carpet Production in Nepal: Beyond the Formal and Informal Economy. The paper looks at the ways gender, caste, class, ethnicity, and kinship networks influence the factory work culture, labor recruitment practices, and   interpersonal relations among the workers. This paper illustrates how weavers' visual appearances, their engagement in certain practices, and their carrying of certain symbols reflect their demographic and cultural backgrounds."
0,"Drawing hypotheses from resource mobilization and resource partitioning theories (RMT and RPT), this article examines how interorganizational competition and social movement industry (SMI) concentration affect the level of tactical and goal specialization of protest organizations associated with the peace, women's, and environmental movements. Additionally, the article examines how specialization affects the survival of these organizations. By and large, the findings are commensurate with the expectations of RMT and RPT. Results indicate that interorganizational competition leads to more specialized tactical and goal repertoires. Concentration in the SMI also leads to specialization, but this is only true for less established organizations. Results also indicate that tactical and goal specialization decrease organizational survival, unless the industry is highly concentrated."
0,"The United States criminal justice and welfare systems are two important government institutions in the lives of the poor. Despite many theoretical discussions about their relationship, their operation at the level of offenders and families remains poorly understood. This paper utilizes Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing data to examine how recent paternal incarceration is associated with families' receipt of TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid/SCHIP. Results robust to multiple tests find that incarceration is not related to subsequent TANF receipt but is significantly associated with increased receipt of food stamps and Medicaid/SCHIP. The findings suggest that greater government involvement among poor families is an unexpected consequence of mass imprisonment; however, increased participation does not include TANF - the cash assistance program of most concern to theorists."
0,"This study analyzes the role of inhabitant opinion survey in laws and regulations related to social impact assessment (SIA) as well as in reports of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in Taiwan. Then a method of conducting an inhabitant survey is proposed to improve the implementation of the current SIA procedure. This study finds that the current laws and regulations assign inhabitant opinion survey a marginal position and do not acknowledge the benefits of a quantitative survey. In contrast, the EIA reports suggest that there is a trend among the project executers to use a simple inhabitant survey to replace qualitative discussions or hearings. This type of simple survey usually lacks of ability to formulate a priority list of issues that should be touched. The method proposed in this study defines inhabitant survey as playing a supplementary role of qualitative discussions and hearings. In addition, the design of the survey question and score calculating methods should be able to decide weight and performance scores of each item being evaluated. This type of design not only can help to generate a priority list of important issues, but also can help the project executer understand general attitude of the inhabitants."
0,"Despite mid-century changes in the population sciences, the post-war discourse of population control extended pre-war eugenic goals, a continuation predicated on boundary work that re-moralized eugenics and defined it as politicized non-science.  Using archival material mostly from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, as well as contemporaneous scientific publications, I show that eugenics devalorizationits relocation from the realm of science to the realm of valuewas the result of struggle for scientific credibility.  Its post-war devalorization transformed its descriptive claims into prescriptive ones.  Yet the 1950s population sciences dealt as much with social problems as its 1930s predecessor had.  Population actors seized the changing social situation of the post-war years, with its new crisis of international political instability, to distance themselves from the eugenic history of their disciplines and emphasize the novelty of their projects.  The new project was fact gathering, a (rhetorical) retreat of controversial work to the shelter of academic institutions. Changing notions of the modern coupled with persistent eugenic concerns with population quality, differential fertility, and protection from dangerous populations resulted in a gestalt image of simultaneous denunciation of eugenics and pursuit of eugenic ends."
0,"In what way do movements move? What do we mean by the movement Of movements? While still a rather unconventional stance, I advance the argument that social movements are, at root, culture production agents. Regardless of whatever else they may accomplish, movements produce new cultural forms in the course of struggle; they often change and augment cultural stock in the process, and sometimes live on for generations in collective memory. My answer to the query follows a movement-centered production and circulation of culture template organized around several major moments Of culture moves: moving across space, moving emotions, moving social-cultural conditions and moving through memory. I illustrate culture moves in these four moments using sociological and historical studies of the long civil rights movement, suggesting a variety of research agendas along the way."
0,"We know too little about the effects of immigration on black Americans. If prior research yields mixed evidence about immigration's consequences for the objective well-being of African Americans, it is silent about effects of immigration on blacks' subjective well-being. To fill that void, this paper assesses the impact of the expanding Hispanic population on black Americans from a social psychological perspective. We ask whether blacks' self-reported distress, social distrust, or attitudes toward Hispanics and immigrants are affected by the size of the local Hispanic population or by the percentage growth in local Hispanic residents. Answers come from responses of non-Hispanic black participants in the 1998-2002 General Social Surveys, linked to 1990 and 2000 census data. Contrary to pessimistic claims, most social psychological outcomes, including measures of economic distress, manifest no impact of local Hispanic numbers. The four exceptions, significant effects of local Hispanic population share or percentage growth evenly split in valence, underscore the complexity of recent immigration's effects on African Americans.

0,"This study examines the economic returns to schooling acquired in the country of origin and the Country of destination. It uses large-scale Survey data oil Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean immigrants in the Netherlands, which contain direct measures of pre- and post-migration schooling. It is studied whether the returns to origin-country schooling depend on contextual factors: i.e., immigrant group and the region of living. Furthermore, we examine the importance of host-country schooling for labor market outcomes and if these can be partly explained by increasing contacts with natives. Results show that the returns to origin-country schooling are higher for Surinamese and Antillean immigrants (i.e., those originating from former Dutch colonies) than for immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. The returns to origin-country schooling are not affected by ethnic concentration in the region of living. Finally, it appears that the returns to host-country schooling are much larger than to origin-country schooling, and the higher returns to host-country schooling cannot be explained by increased social contacts with natives."
0,"We articulate a theory of scientific and technical human capital, and argue that it provides a way to understand differences between and among academic scientists.  We use human, social, life course, and social network theory to argue that scientists vary in their individual science-related human and social endowments, and that this variation creates greater and lesser degrees of scientific capacity which are then brought to the individuals career and, ultimately, to science itself.  Because this form of capital is dynamic, it is both an input and a product of the scientific enterprise, continually evolving over the course of a scientists career.  Using a nationally representative sample of academic scientists, we operationalize the S&T human capital construct, and demonstrate how it affects career outcomes of scientists."
0,"Research has shown that film critics, through the use of particular critical frameworks, are able to assess whether or not a film should become canonical based on how well it was received in the past as well as its cultural durability. However, this research ignores the process by which certain films are marked as entertainment at the time of their release versus those that are praised as works of art. Although the processes by which the legitimation of film as art form are well-documented, previous work has paid little attention to the legitimation of films across a variety of genres, including those considered popular. In light of recent work on cultural omnivorousness, this research examines the changing role of critics as they move from elevating the status of film to high art, to assessing the merits of films based on their respective genre conventions. It looks at the ways in which critics, as cultural intermediaries, come to evaluate films and the critical frameworks they use in order to do so. Central to these frameworks is an understanding and evaluation of the necessary requirements of particular genres, suggesting that what counts as legitimate culture varies across different types of films at different times. Genre conventions emerge as a central feature of critical frameworks, and come to guide them in addition to more traditional approaches to film as art."
0,"Increases in the association between spouses' earnings have the potential to increase inequality as marriages increasingly consist of two high-earning or two low-earning partners. This article uses log-linear models and data from the March Current Population Survey to describe trends in the association between spouses' earnings and estimate their contribution to growing earnings inequality among married couples from 1967 to 2005. The results indicate that increases in earnings inequality would have been about 25%-30% lower than observed in the absence of changes in the association, depending on the inequality measure used. Three components of these changes and how they vary across the earnings distribution are explored."
0,"In this article, we demonstrate how the taken-for-granted, inner-workings of culture can become implicated in the (in)visibility of minority members. We seek to illuminate ways in which institutions may unwittingly facilitate (in)visibility through their organizational habitus. We begin by providing further evidence of invisibility and visibility as real and commonly experienced psychosocial phenomena among minorities within predominantly white, institutional settings. In particular, we argue that a minority's inconspicuousness can be simultaneously fused together with one's conspicuousness to form what we call racial/ethnic (in)visibility. This study employs focus-group data collected from a sample of administrators and faculty from elite K-12 independent (private) schools, an institution that admittedly has been slow to make cultural change in its racial/ethnic ideologies and practices."
0,"Drawing on an integrated theoretical lens of vocabularies of motive, gender interactionism, and queer theory, the authors explore how eighteen lesbian mothers and twenty-two gay fathers negotiate the cultural narratives of heteronormativity and gender essentialism as they imagine and participate in constructing their children's gender. Findings highlight the extent to which participants' parenting fantasies and realities occur within a context of heightened gender accountability that they manage for their children. The authors show how the practice of securing gender role models for their children is one way that non-heterosexual parents manage this accountability. Next, the authors introduce ""queer ruptures"" in participants' narratives and detail the subtle ways that they destabilize the existing heteronormative gender order. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for empirical and theoretical development."
0,"This investigation of public parades in New Orleans furthers our understanding of the importance of performance and ritual to the structure of racial and class identity in a post-industrial, post-disaster society.  From the imagined southern aristocracy constructed through the excesses of Mardi Gras to the imagined tribal nations of the Mardi Gras Indians and imagined wealth of Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs, cultural performance provides portals into the aesthetic dimension of this historically multi-cultural space: this is an autonomous cultural space in which both creators and joiners find opportunities for individual agency through the activities of public performance. The collective effervescence generated through these rituals has created the logic and momentum to rebuild meanings of local life and rebuild communities in post-Katrina New Orleans."
0,"Using a quasi-experimental research design, this study examines the effect of terrorist events on the perception of immigrants across 65 regions from nine European countries. Based on group-threat and intergroup contact theory, I first elaborate a theoretical mechanism that explains the effect of events on attitudes towards immigrants, and elucidates the conditions under which such an effect occurs. To evaluate this argument, I make use of the fact that the terror attack in Bali on October the 12th 2002 occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2002. In particular, I use the terror attack as an exogenous source of variation, together with the timing of the interviews, to define the experiment’s treatment and control groups. The findings from this natural experiment reveal considerable cross-national and regional variation in both the magnitude of the causal effect and its temporal duration. In two or less clearly three out of the nine countries for which the fieldwork period coincided with the terror attack in Bali (Portugal, and Poland, and Finland), the estimated causal effect is highly significant and substantial. The analysis on the regional level supports the argument about contextual variations in the response to the event. Implications of the findings for societal responses to terror attacks, the literature on attitudes towards immigrants, and survey research are discussed."
0,"The National Welfare Rights Organization of the late 1960s and early 1970s was the site of an internal battle over the character of the movement.  What was the collective identity of those who were, or should be, mobilized, and what cultural-political strategy should be used?  The debates and contestation revolved around issues of gender, race, and class, with some seeking to foreground these issues and others to elide them in an organization whose members were predominantly black women, but whose staff was composed largely of white men.  Should the racial-gender identity of those targeted be central to self-understanding and political strategy, or should the movement attempt to create a multi-issue organization that would mobilize men as well as women, wage-earners as well as welfare recipients?  Should the movement organize around a politics of economic justice that cut across race and gender lines but, in doing so, threaten to marginalize needs particular to low-income mothers?  The members (as opposed to the staff) of NWRO wanted to foreground issues of race, gender, and motherhood; ACORN was formed as the direct product of a considered rejection of the welfare rights strategy, a rejection of what was viewed as the NWRO’s overly narrow and politically vulnerable constituency of predominantly black welfare mothers.  ACORN defined itself as a multi-issue, multi-racial movement of low and middle income men and women.  The alternatives posed by these two organizations have implications for how we today think about welfare and welfare reform."
0,"In-depth conversations with 48 self-identified bisexual women and men attempt to re-evaluate West and Zimmermans (1987) concept of doing gender, and West and Fenstermakers (1995) doing difference.  In this paper I apply these previous conceptualizations to what I have conceptualized as doing bisexuality.  The hidden status of bisexual identities reveals how sex, gender and sexuality are accomplished simultaneously (although to varying degrees), and that doing bisexuality is eclipsed by the heterosexual matrix.  The conflict between social bisexual identity and individual bisexuality identity creates a sexual identity crisis as respondents are more often than not expected to pledge allegiance to the hetoro-homo dichotomy, thus leaving little room for a distinct bisexual identity to exist.  This eclipse of bi identities happens when one must rely on the interaction and interpretation of others with regard to forming a social identity, and when outside actors misconstrue ones intentions one is left with little choice but to be socially identified within the hetero/homo, either/or dichotomy."
0,"Definitions of the family are increasingly important as individuals and policymakers wrestle with the implications of divorce and remarriage, single parenthood, gay and lesbian marriage and parenting, infertility technologies, and the potential outcomes of human cloning.  Yet a comprehensive framework or theory of definitions of the family is currently lacking.  Using a grounded theory approach, this research offers such a framework.   Specifically, it is argued that definitions of the family vary along a continuum with biological conceptions on one end, social conceptions on the other, and feelings of ambivalence characterizing the area between the two poles.  Conceiving of definitions of the family in this way offers a more complete picture of the myriad ways family can be defined.  Moreover, it lends insight into situations where biological and social definitions simultaneously coexist and conflict or where individuals conceptions of family change over time."
0,"This article investigates contextual and individual factors influencing environmental behaviors for the 26 countries included in the 2000 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). Individuals in countries with better environmental quality tend to have slightly more environmental involvement, but this relationship is mediated by economic circumstances, which have a greater independent impact on environmental actions. Respondents living in wealthier countries, no matter the environmental quality, more frequently join environmental groups, sign petitions concerning the environment, and give money for environmental causes."
0,"Based upon an ethnographic study of the straight edge subculture, a clean-living movement connected to the punk rock scene, this paper examines how members of youth subcultures understand their involvement as they grow older in their scene. As they age, members of subcultures face more choices than simply exiting the group or maintaining their previous involvement. Not all members drop out entirely; indeed, most find new expressions for their subcultural values as their involvement wanes. They create new meanings and incorporate new understandings that are compatible with life outside of the subculture. I first examine older members critical and reflexive understandings of straight edge. Next, I reveal how older members continue their involvement, focusing on strategies they employ to keep the identity relevant to their lives. I conclude by discussing how both those who leave and those who stay redefine their connection to the straight edge identity."
0,"Sociologists have long recognized that historical events, such as wars, depressions, and natural disasters, influence trajectories of people's lives and reproduce or alter social structures. This article extends that line of research. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I test three accounts regarding how combat exposure in war affects men's ability to work. The direct cumulative disadvantage account posits that war negatively affects servicemen who see combat, regardless of their pre-combat characteristics. The moderated cumulative disadvantage account suggests that combat most negatively affects men who had lower status before they fought. The turning point account suggests the reverse: combat most negatively affects men who had greater status before they fought. Findings suggest that with regard to disability and unemployment, the effects of combat exposure in war are most consistent with the direct cumulative disadvantage account."
0,"In the late 1990s, the British anti-genetic engineering (GE) movement effectively closed Britain's market for genetically modified foods, while the U. S. anti-GE movement had a negligible impact. In seeking to explain the different outcomes of these similar social movements, the authors draw upon the global commodity chains (GCC) literature to extend the understanding of the economic and industry-related openings and closures social movements face as they seek to promote social change. This analysis not only illustrates the importance of economic structures and organization for movement outcomes, but also shows how the economic sphere is culturally constituted. In this fashion, it broadens the social movement literature's understanding both of the way that political economy matters to movement efficacy and of the way that cultural processes infuse the economic sphere. The study advances the GCC literature by showing how GCCs are cultural as well as economic constructs."
0,"In the last two decades classical sociology, notably Marx, has been mined for environmental insights in the attempt to surmount the ""human exemptionalism"" of post-Second World War sociology. Weber, however, has remained an enigma in this respect. This article addresses Weber's approach to the environment, including its significance for his interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to constructing a meaningful postexemptionalist sociology."
0,"To successfully resettle 1 27 million Chinese for the construction of the Three Gorges Project (TGP) the Chinese government employed a new re-resettlement policy which emphasizes infrastructural development of the resettlement sites to assure resettlers a sustainable livelihood following resettlement Unfortunately, many benefits the policy promised have not materialized As a result many resettlers have suffered an increase in depressive symptoms associated with unmet expectations Using panel data collected before and after relocation from a sample of Three Gorges resettlers we found that a high proportion of resettlers reported unmet expectations which were significantly associated with an increase in depressive symptoms Our findings indicate that undeliverable promises can backfire and further aggravate the harm inflicted on the displaced caused by the project-induced displacement From the perspective of resettlers, a sound coping strategy to minimize the harm caused by the displacement on their mental wellbeing is to expect for the worst Published by Elsevier Inc"
0,"Using data from a national sample of 935 teenagers, we examine the ability of routine activities theory to predict cyberbullying. The data used in this analysis were collected as part of the Pew Internet and American Life Project Web site. Among the different elements of routine activities theory, suitability and availability were found to have the strongest correlations to experienced cyberbullying. Using logistic regression, our findings show that routine activities theory is a viable explanation for cyberbullying risk among teenagers."
0,"This study focuses on the factors underlying differences in relationship quality between interethnic and same-ethnic couples. Using the National Survey of Families and Households and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we examine relationship satisfaction, interpartner conflict and subjective assessments Of relationship instability in married and cohabiting couples. Partners in interethnic unions generally reported lower levels of relationship quality than did partners in same-ethnic unions. These differences held for women as well as men, and for married as well as cohabiting couples. Differences in relationship quality were largely accounted for by more complex relationship histories, more heterogamous unions, fewer shared values and less support from parents. In contrast, differences in socioeconomic resources did not appear to play an explanatory role."
0,"A popular explanation for race and ethnic disparities in academic achievement is that minorities are exposed to different peers and have different opportunities to make friends with high-achievers. Although we know that adolescents from different race and ethnic groups attend different schools and that they choose different friends, we do not know how these different opportunities affect the friends they make. This paper fills this gap by studying how the opportunities within adolescents' schools affect race and ethnic differences in the academic characteristics of friends. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the conditional logit and opportunities framework, I account for adolescents' different opportunities to make friends both within and across schools. Ignoring their different opportunities, Black and Latino adolescents' nominated friends have significantly lower levels of achievement than white adolescents. After accounting for their different opportunities to make friends within and between schools, race and ethnic differences in the achievement characteristics of friends disappear. If Black and Latino adolescents' opportunity structures were identical to white adolescents', their probabilities of nominating high-achieving friends would not differ. "
0,"This paper explains how the lesbian/gay movement in San Francisco arrived at a new institutional settlement in the early 1970s. In 1968 gay liberation displayed a contradictory mix of civil rights, identity, and revolutionary political ideologies. By 1972 the movement had stabilized around building gay identity and pursuing civil rights. The crystallization of the field around gay pride and gay rights was not inevitable, but a result of the specific way events unfolded in this historical moment. While the New Left enabled the emergence of gay liberation by making thinkable new ways of organizing around sexuality, this same sense of possibility made it difficult for activists to assess competing alternatives and thus generated internal conflict. The rapid decline of the New Left in the early 1970s clarified the political environment. It reduced internal conflict and allowed political consensus to form around approaches compatible with emerging political opportunities. Thus, the way that events unfolded produced the right set of conditions for the forging of this new field - the right actors in the right place and time with the right cultural models. The role of historically specific events in the forging of this field suggests that ""conditions peculiar to the circumstance"" play a role in field crystallization generally (Sewell 1996, p. 862). This attention to process challenges the view that field crystallization can be predicted from prior constellations of power and social structure."
0,"Using a data set of public and private relief spending for 295 cities, this article examines the racial and ethnic patterning of social welfare provision in the United States in 1929. On the eve of the Depression, cities with more blacks or Mexicans spent the least on social assistance and relied more heavily on private money to fund their programs. Cities with more European immigrants spent the most on relief and relied more heavily on public funding. Distinct political systems, labor market relations, and racial ideologies about each group's proclivity to use relief best explain relief spending differences across cities."
0,"Intra-household relationships across multiple generations have been the focus of a vast array of scholarly research examining what is the driving force motivating household interactions.  A broad theoretical approach for examining these questions is to ask whether household dynamics are altruistically oriented or geared toward a model of social exchange.  By focusing at specific moments where these relationships are manifest we can address this debate.  One obvious manifestation is household division.  Utilizing panel data on Indian households for 1994 and 2005, this paper analyzes co-residence and household division as related to caring for the elderly and expectations of reciprocity.  If altruism is a motivating factor underlying inter-generational support, we should see fewer split households with the presence of an elderly household member, particularly one who is ill.  Though the bequesting of land should temper altruism in favor of reciprocity and reduce the likelihood of household division."
0,"Disability theorists have spent much time discussing how disability is defined. The theoretical roots for these debates reside in the medical, structural, and minority models of disability. The medical model views disability as equivalent to a functional impairment; the minority model sees a lack of equal rights as a primary impediment to social equality between able and disabled populations; and the structural model looks to environmental factors as the cause of disability. While debates over how to define disability are informative, there is currently an insufficient amount of empirical research looking at how people come to identify themselves as having a disability. Rather than focus on how disability is (or should be) defined, herein we look at how disability identities are constructed as people search for work. We show that people's interactions with employers and employment agencies have important influences on how disability identities are constructed. We borrow from the ""doing gender"" and ""racial formations"" paradigms to introduce an interactive approach to looking at how disability identities are constructed. We introduce the concept of disability formation to highlight how disability identities are continually negotiated through interactions with employment agencies and employers. Our findings are based on focus groups with 58 people who self-identified as having a disability and were working or searching for work."
0,"Talcott Parsons ideas are shown to have operational meaning when applied to organizations in two respects. (1) Parsons typology of system needs provides a meaningful way of categorizing administrative rules (protocols) developed by the subunit under study, and (2) phase dominance, anticipated by structural functionalists, is tested. Our analysis adds to Parsons framework (a) by helping to clarify the distinctive (and generally unappreciated) role that can be played by ground-level administrative units in the process of adaptive change within large and complex organizations, and (b) by informing our understanding of organizational alignment with external societal forces."
0,"The rates of cigarette smoking among Indigenous adolescents are higher than any other ethnic group in the United States, and this difference persists into adulthood. Although Indigenous adolescents smoke earlier, smoke more, and are more likely to become regular smokers as adults, we know very little about their early smoking trajectories. In this study we use hierarchical linear modeling across four waves of data from Indigenous adolescents aged 10 to 13 at wave one to investigate factors associated with becoming a daily smoker. In this sample, deviant peer influence is a strong correlate in the development of regular smoking behavior but several factors modify this association, including age, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, family monitoring, and having parents with substance use disorders. Identifying and understanding factors associated with daily smoking is important to developing effective prevention and intervention programs targeted at the most vulnerable adolescents."
0,"Despite the international growth of the service sector an industrial paradigm defines the study of global labor. This is because analyses of service work typically focus on firms in the United States, while studies of global labor concentrate on manufacturing. I develop a framework for analysis of global service work by comparing ethnographic cases of labor in two global, luxury hotels in China. Each hotel is linked to the same US.-based global corporation, and both employ the same organizational template and recruit same aged female workers. At the first hotel, workers silently cater to the preferences of guests, using recorded customer preference data and enacting imported feminized practices, a labor regime I call virtual personalism. At the second hotel, workers promote hotel products, displaying expertise to distinguish themselves from sex workers who frequent the hotel, a labor regime I call virtuous professionalism. Why do distinctly gendered labor practices emerge in the two settings? To explain the divergent regimes of labor I show that firms institutionalize localized consumer status struggles through the gendered organization of interactive labor. Workers 'interactive strategies and local workplace legacies mediate the forms institutionalism takes. I call the entwining of consumer markets and labor practices ""market-embedded labor."""
0,"In this paper, I rely on survey data and 110 in-depth interviews to discuss how black professionals in Brazil and South Africa identify racial discrimination in different realms of their lives.  By making racial boundaries highly visible, incidents of discrimination can reveal the different manners race structures relations in different national contexts.  Racial discrimination was perceived as being strong in Brazil and South Africa, but the contexts, types of incidents and explanations for discrimination were very different in the two countries.  Black professionals in Brazil perceive more public exclusion and private inclusion, while those in South Africa perceive growing public inclusion alongside continuing private exclusion.  In Brazil, black professionals tend to experience more discrimination in anonymous interactions in public settings (restaurants, stores, etc).  Even if their presence is not acknowledged in the media or public discourse, they are more accepted through norms of cordiality in private life.  In South Africa, black professionals are decreasingly discriminated against in the public realm, due to strongly publicized political and national change.  But in personal interactions within historically white-dominated environments like the corporate workplace and historically white institutions, they feel much more excluded and stigmatized.  By focusing on how racial boundaries are identified, experienced and resisted, narratives of discrimination are an interesting key to compare how race relations are organized across national contexts."
0,"Although previous research demonstrates the importance of the availability of marriageable men, earnings, and employment stability for racial differences in marriage, it also suggests that other factors likely contribute to this variation. This study investigates a new factor that might help to explain racial variation in marriage, the kinship group. To explore this possible connection, we examine the influence of parental kin involvement experienced during childhood and adolescence on marriage in adulthood using all three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. While few of the measures of kin ties have significant effects on marriage, some measures were significantly related and the patterns of associations sometimes varied by race. "
0,"This paper explores the durability of the Gautreaux Two housing mobility program, which was implemented in 2002. The program gave low-income residents of Chicago public housing a special voucher providing them with the opportunity to move to more advantaged neighborhoods, designated as neighborhoods in which at least 76.5 percent of households were non-poor and 70 percent were non-black. Four waves of in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted by Northwesterns Institute for Policy Research (IPR) between 2002 and 2005 with a randomly chosen sample of 91 families. Within the three-year study window, this qualitative analysis of the IPR data compares residents who made secondary moves to those who stayed at their Gautreaux placement addresses. I divide these secondary movers into two groups, those who made subsequent moves to other relatively advantaged neighborhoods and those who moved back to more disadvantaged neighborhoods. With insight from feminist urbanism, I offer a detailed comparison of the reasons some moved while others stayed that focuses on social networks. I find that secondary movers were motivated by a number of social network factors, including feelings of social isolation in the placement neighborhood, distance from kin, and transportation difficulties. Conversely, strong social networks were also crucial reasons why some families remained in their Gautreaux neighborhoods or moved on to other similarly advantaged neighborhoods. This analysis provides insight about policy implications for the success of mobility programs, including the need for continued program assistance to build and maintain strong social networks beyond the initial placement."

Some key features of that failure are analyzed in this paper, and it is suggested that critical realists and poststructuralist feminists cannot gain much from uncontextualized ontological and epistemological arguments in their dialogue."
0,"In this paper, I combine national income distribution data from 117 countries to produce a synthetic composite income distribution of all the households in the world.  Most conventional thinking about the emergence of a ""global"" economy would predict a single, unimodal, lognormal distribution of income, with most of the population of the world falling into a band surrounding the median global income.  The empirical result, however, is strikingly different: a clearly bimodal distribution of global income, with both the lower and the upper nodes surrounded by a clearly lognormal spread.  These patterns tend to confirm the Arrighi-Drangel (1986) model of global commodity chains that are divided into core and peripheral nodes.  Going further, they suggest the existence of two interacting global economies, with one subject to Marxist and Malthusian pressures while the other is able to extract a comfortable surplus.  As world-systems theorists have argued for three decades, a global world-economy does not seem to imply any trend toward a uniform world-economy."
0,"Social problems theory has yet to fully address the impact that new communication technologies are having on the claims-making process. This article examines the emergence of the blogosphere as a cultural phenomenon that provides claims-makers with a powerful new public arena to advance social problem claims. Using Stephen Hilgartner and Charles Bosk's (1988) public arenas model of social problem construction, blog-generated problem claims are examined to analyze how Internet driven social problems compete for public attention. Findings suggest that blogs make the claims-making process more efficient, offer expanded carrying capacity compared to traditional arenas, and provide outsider claims-makers with greater opportunity to have a voice in social problems construction. Still, only a small number of blogs have become recognized as claims-making arenas; they still rely on traditional principles of selection; and bloggers face the same competition for mainstream media attention as claims-makers using traditional arenas."
0,"In an organization with approximately 2.2 million active duty and reserve personnel, the military must select, train, and maintain the force through formal policies that cover large numbers of people. However, even though the end goal is to manage service members evenly and efficiently, policies directing who is able to serve and in what capacity are largely shaped by social attitudes, particularly those surrounding gender and sexuality.  Building on this perspective, this paper analyzes how formal policy and informal norms, which privilege heteronormative masculinity, influence the gender and sexuality demographics of the American military.  We argue that even though formal policy change is on the horizon for both military women and gay men and lesbians that these formal changes may not have an immediate impact on who serves in the Armed Forces, the timing of their service, and where in the organization they do so.  Using a transnational perspective, we begin by discussing women’s military participation, both currently and over time, and the impact of enabling factors, such as changes in women’s labor force participation, legislative and judicial decree, and manpower needs during wartime.  We then discuss the evolution of formal policy regarding the service of openly gay men and lesbians and how their acknowledged presence impacts military culture.  After considering the integration experiences of openly gay men and lesbians in other Western countries, we discuss the history of their service in the American military and conclude with a discussion on the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”"
0,"This paper examines interactions at a legal clinic in South Central Los Angeles where clients receive assistance to expunge criminal records. Expungement in California conceals minor criminal convictions from employers, mitigating the “collateral consequences” or “life-course effects” of incarceration. To qualify for this clean slate, clients are sometimes required to write a letter to the judge admitting guilt and demonstrating remorse and rehabilitation. But some refuse to offer this account, arguing instead that they were wrongfully convicted. Using ethnographic research, I show how neither legal workers’ attempts to solicit the truth nor their suggestions to act instrumentally convinces these clients to alter their account. I examine this conflict over narratives – recognized by legal scholars – to see what it can tell us about how these individuals interpret their convictions and how they now seek to address its consequences. I show that accounts of wrongful conviction include not only claims of innocence, but also being cajoled to do wrong deeds for others or taking the fall for a loved one. For these individuals, the value of maintaining their claim of wrongful conviction or merely preserving their reputation among the clinic’s staff is greater than the value of receiving post-conviction legal relief."
0,"This paper uses Dorothy Smiths institutional ethnography framework to explore how welfare recipients attending university both resist and engage dominant discourses regarding paid work, unpaid work and welfare receipt. In-depth interviews of twenty-four welfare recipients reveal that these parents resist the work plan of welfare reform by attending university in the hope of attaining good jobs, not just any job. In some ways these student recipients draw from an intensive mothering ideology, but in other ways they challenge it. Most students envisioned structural changes in order to reconcile parenting, paid work, and schoolwork, but also avoided structural explanations when discussing the predicament of other welfare recipients. The conclusion explores why these student recipients are more likely than other welfare recipients to invoke structural viewpoints and suggests several possibilities for changing the university and welfare state to better meet student recipients needs."
0,"Scholars and policy makers have for centuries constructed and used developmental hierarchies to characterize different countries. The hypotheses motivating this paper are that such social constructions have been circulated internationally, are constructed similarly in various countries, and follow the social constructions of elite international organizations, such as the United Nations. This paper uses data from 15 surveys in 13 diverse countries to study how developmental hierarchies are understood in everyday life. Our research shows that most people have constructions of developmental hierarchies that are similar across countries and are similar to the developmental hierarchies constructed by the United Nations. These findings suggest that developmental hierarchies are widely understood around the world and are widely available to ordinary people as they make decisions about many aspects of life.

0,"The energy distribution principle, borrowed from thermodynamics and adapted to the formation of social groups by Mayhew et al. (1995), predicts that the increasing energy requirements to form and maintain larger groups is so high as to suppress large groups altogether.  Therefore, smaller groups are expected to be more prevalent under certain conditions.  This paper utilizes a new data set collected by the author from online sources, and tracks 78,356 individuals in 3,714 groups in the United States and Germany over a two and a half month period.  Findings confirm that the energy distribution principle may well constrain the formation of groups, as larger groups are more uncommon than smaller groups and group homogeneity is at a minimum.  Results suggest that the energy distribution principle applies readily to this type of data, given that Mayhew et al. (1995) suggest it should only be relevant for data on small, face-to-face groups.  Extensions and suggestions for future research are also discussed."
0,"This paper examines the interplay between social identity and social networks among unmarried women in rural Malawi.  We draw upon survey and qualitative data from a sub-set (N=258) of the 2004 youth sample as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP).  Evidence from the survey data indicate that those who managed to stay in school were significantly more likely to abstain from sex, controlling for important covariates.  The survey data also show that key characteristics of social networks were significantly different among girls still schooling versus those who were not.  In the qualitative interviews, schoolgirls often said their friends encouraged each other to study hard, and that schooling and sex were incompatible:  having a boyfriend disturbs the mind, thus interfering with educational attainment and the opportunities that might follow. Moreover, as young women approach the average age of marriage and drop-out rates increase, those who remain in school are identified by others, and identify themselves, as elites in their community, and they come to adopt a set of repertoires and practices that serve to continuously affirm their identities as educated and modern."
0,"In this research I compare the motivations to enter the teaching occupation among 49 novice teachers who participated in traditional and alternative preparation programs to explore the influence of age and career stage on the decision making process. Early career entrants in both groups were more likely to cite the subject specialty as a reason to enter the occupation but only mid-career traditionally certified teachers included social concerns as a motivator. Overall, twice as many alternatively certified teachers cited the opportunity for a stable career as a motivator than did traditionally certified teachers."
0,"Researchers hypothesize that social capital in the United States is not just declining, but that it is declining across generations or birth cohorts. Testing this proposition, we examine changes in social capital using age-period-cohort intrinsic estimator models. Results from analyses of 1972-2010 General Social Survey data show (1. that informal association with neighbors declined across periods while informal association with friends outside of the neighborhood increased across birth cohorts; (2. that formal association was comparatively stable with the exception of relatively high levels of formal association among the early 1920s and early 1930s birth cohorts; and (3. that trust declined considerably across both periods and cohorts, though the oldest cohorts are less trusting than those born in the 1920s through the 1940s. While the results suggest that changes in social capital are more complex than the simple decline depicted by many researchers, the aspects of social capital that have declined may be essential for promoting social and political participation."
0,"This project explores the notion of a civility of indifference to see how useful this concept is for understanding the management of social relations under imperial occupation.  In light of recent events in Iraq, there is a need to examine the dilemmas that foreign countries face when they want to control diverse communities in an unstable political context.  I first review how scholars have used the term civility of indifference and then apply this concept to an empirical case as a means of evaluating its significance and usefulness.  My empirical data concerns the French colony of Pondicherry (India) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  I argue that the separation of ethnic and racial groups and preservation of local customs seem to have been the best approach to minimizing ethnic disharmony in the colonial context during certain historical periods. I hope to offer a more detailed manifestation of civility of indifference through this historical example, to better specify under what conditions is the concept applicable."
0,"Approaching the public representation of a ""difficult past"" as a macro-level impression management dilemma, this article addresses how states manage reputation-damaging elements of their histories on global stages. Through an empirical case study, I examine how the Croatian government has represented the country to international audiences via tourism after the wars of Yugoslav secession. Challenging assumptions that contentious historical moments will be commemorated, I find that the state has managed Croatia ""diflicult"" recent past through covering and cultural reframing rather than public acknowledgment. The country has omitted the war from representations of national history and repositioned Croatia as identical in history and culture to its Western European neighbors. I draw from Goffman's work on stigma to explain the Croatian case and to develop a broader theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which public recognition of reputation-damaging events is likely not to occur I conclude by discussing theoretical implications for scholarship on collective memory, cultural sociology, and world polity theory."
0,"At the turn of the 21st Century, there have been significant numbers of Chief Executive Officers that have been either accused or indicted for white collar criminal activity against their respective corporations.   While very few traditional theories of criminological deviance truly seek to examine the upper-class or white collar crime, Durkheims theoretical notion of Anomie appears to be the most effective means for examining this recent phenomenon. Rather than examining the economic or criminological factors that might influence this phenomenon, this author contends that the larger sociological examination, under the rubric of anomie, acts as the most effective means for understanding this sociological phenomenon."
0,"This paper explores the social dimensions of microfinance programs which are credit and savings programs targeted at fostering financial self-sustainability of the poor. Such programs have become the most popular development strategy since the 1990s and microfinance groups are to be found in developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. These groups are rural neighborhood based groups composed almost exclusively of women in most cases. One of the central premises of these programs is that giving credit to women rather than men leads to their empowerment by giving them greater control over household economic resources. However, I find that there are also non-economic ways in which such group membership leads to womens empowerment. In this paper I will use the case study of one such group to demonstrate how social capital gained by the women through such group membership plays a key role in their empowerment. Enhanced social capital in this case finds expression through group based collective action for acquiring public goods. This in turn leads to a positive change in the public perception of womens collective power. This results in a virtuous cycle of a change in womens self-perception of their power which is reflected in greater agency. This calls for a more sociologically informed analysis of such financial programs and more attention to the social dimensions of economic interventions."
0,"Marriage patterns differ dramatically in the United States by race and education. The author identifies a novel explanation for these marital divides, namely, the important role of personal wealth in marriage entry. Using event-history models and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, the author shows that wealth is an important predictor of first marriage and that differences in asset ownership by race and education help to explain a significant portion of the race and education gaps in first marriage. The article also tests possible explanations for why wealth plays an important role in first marriage entry."
0,"Our paper examines service usage (e.g., shelter) as well as a typology of individuals who are most likely to use groupings of services among 249 homeless youth. Our results revealed that the majority of homeless young people have used food programs (66%) and street outreach (65%) on at least one occasion within the past year. Cluster analysis of services revealed four distinct groups: (1) basic survival service use, characterized by above average shelter, food, and outreach service use, but below average on counseling, substance abuse/mental health services, and incarceration; (2) multiple service use, which included above average use of all six services; (3) incarceration experience, characterized by above average incarceration experience, but below average use of all other five services; and (4) minimal service use, which included slightly above average use of counseling, but below average use of all other services. These findings have the potential to provide important information that may assist with targeting services to homeless youth. "

Using data from three waves of the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study to consider children born to married or cohabiting mothers (N = 1730), we determine that children who have experienced poor union quality between mothers and their partners have higher predicted aggressive behavior scores at age 3, regardless of whether they have experienced union transitions, compared to children who have experienced high-quality, stable unions. Children who have experienced instability in the context of higher-quality unions and relatively less acrimonious dissolutions are similar to children raised in high-quality stable unions in terms of predicted aggressive behavior scores.

0,"This study evaluated the empirical merits of a multilevel model of English language proficiency among immigrants. The model represents a synthesis of Blaus structural theory of intergroup relations and the human capital model used by labor economists.  A total of eight hypotheses were derived from the model and were subjected to empirical tests using multilevel ordinal logistic analysis.  Individual and aggregate data files from the 2000 U.S. census were merged to build a three-level data file consisting of variables measured at individual, group, and MSA levels for members of 20 non-English language groups.  The results of our multilevel analysis lent strong support to predictions derived from Blaus theory that immigrants English proficiency is affected negatively by group size and segregation, and positively by linguistic heterogeneity and income inequality between native- and foreign-born in the community.  In addition, individual factors also exerted significant effects on English fluency as predicted by the human capital model."
0,This study explains why the power of neoliberal business over the Mexican state increased during the last three decades of the 20th century.  It identifies three sources of increased neoliberal business power that occurred in conjunction with neoliberal reforms: (1) active mobilization by neoliberal business (2) increased access to the state by neoliberal business and (3) increased economic power of neoliberal business.  It thereby contributes additional evidence that counters the view of Mexicos state neoliberalizers as acting autonomously from business.  It further outlines two conditions that were instrumental in bringing about the increased power of neoliberal business:  the onset of economic crisis in the 1970s and a shift in foreign capital preferences in Mexico.  The analysis demonstrates how Mexicos sources and conditions of business power differed from those in advanced industrial societies and outlines why the Mexican case may be a good starting point for devising a historically-contingent theory of business power in the semiperiphery.
0,"Emotions are essential but little understood components of research; they catalyze and sustain creative scientific work and fuel the scientific and intellectual social movements (SIMs) that propel scientific change. Adopting a micro-sociological focus, we examine how emotions shape two intellectual processes central to all scientific work: conceiving creative ideas and managing skepticism. We illustrate these processes through a longitudinal study of the Resilience Alliance, a tightly networked coherent group collaborating at the center of a burgeoning scientific social movement in the environmental sciences. We show how emotions structured and were structured by the group's growth and development, and how socio-emotive processes facilitated the rapid production of highly creative science and helped overcome skepticism by outsiders. Hot spots and hot moments-that is, brief but intense periods of collaboration undertaken in remote and isolated settings-fueled the group's scientific performance and drove the SIM. Paradoxically, however, the same socio-emotive processes that ignited and sustained creative scientific research also made skepticism more likely to occur and more difficult to manage. Similarly, emotions and social bonding were essential for the group's growth and development, but increased size and diversity have the potential to erode the affective culture that generated initial successes."
0,This reserach examines wealth distribution across ethnic groups in Israel and evaluates the role of labor market rewards and intergenerational transfers in producing ethnic disparities. Israel SHARE data from 2005-2006 are used in the analyses. The findings reveal considerable ethnic disparities in wealth. Wealth disparities are most pronounced when Israeli-born Jews are compared with Arabs and with immigrants from the Former Soviet Union. Further analysis suggests that wealth buildup in Israel is influenced by two major sources: income flows and inheritance. The differential impact of the two sources on wealth disparities can be best understood when considering the unique position of each ethnic group in Israeli society.
0,"We examine the origins of voluntary associations devoted to environmental protection, focusing on the divergent trajectories of industrialized versus developing countries. We consider a wide range of domestic economic, political, and institutional dynamics that give rise to environmental associations. Developing and extending neo-institutional world polity arguments, we characterize domestic association in the developing world as the product of global cultural models, legitimation, and resources. Using event history and dynamic panel models, we analyze the formation of domestic environmental associations for a large sample of countries in the contemporary period. Among highly industrialized countries, domestic factors-resources and political institutions that afford favorable opportunities-largely explain the prevalence of environmental associations. In contrast, global forces are a powerful catalyst for environmental organizing in the developing world. The environmental movement, which had domestic origins in the West, became institutionalized in the world polity, generating new associations on a global scale. We also find positive effects of democratic institutions and philanthropic foundations. Environmental degradation and societal affluence are not primary drivers of environmental association. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of globally-sponsored voluntary associations, which appear to be common in the developing world."
0,"Entrepreneurial groups face a twinned challenge: recognizing and implementing new ideas. We argue that entrepreneurship is less about importing ideas than about generating new knowledge by recombining resources. In contrast to the brokerage-plus-closure perspective, we address the overlapping of cohesive group structures. In analyzing the network processes of intercohesion, we identify a distinctive network topology: the structural fold. Actors at the structural fold are multiple insiders, facilitating familiar access to diverse resources. Our data set records personnel ties among the largest 1,696 Hungarian enterprises from 1987 to 2001. First, we test whether structural folding contributes to group performance. Second, because entrepreneurship is a process of generative disruption, we test the contribution of structural folds to group instability. Third, we move from dynamic methods to historical network analysis and demonstrate that coherence is a property of interwoven lineages of cohesion, built up through repeated separation and reunification."
0,"This study employs a social capital perspective to examine determinants and content of informal communication about HIV/AIDS among members of different Christian congregations in Mozambique. First, we use data from a survey conducted in both rural and urban congregations to analyze factors that shape such communication, and detect that it is more likely to occur in gender-homophilous networks, in more ideologically flexible and socially diverse congregations, and in congregations located in rural areas. We then use the survey data to examine the main themes of congregation-based communication about HIV/AIDS and find denominational and location patterns that correspond to those detected in the first stage of analysis. Finally, we use qualitative data, collected in parallel with the survey, to explore how informal communication is used to reconcile the often conflicting secular and church messages. We interpret our findings in light of structural dynamics within religious congregations and the social construction of HIV/AIDS risks and prevention in that sub-Saharan setting."
0,"In pediatric visits that involve children with upper respiratory tract infections, whether or not to prescribe antibiotics is one of the most common and important decisions to be made. The role parents play in this process is frequently overlooked if it does not take the form of an overt request for medication.  This paper examines history taking in pediatric visits of this type.  I argue that through an interactional practice of adding additional symptoms in an environment where they have just provided a no problem answer, parents are subtly pushing physicians away from a no problem diagnosis (which would typically not be treated with antibiotics).  The problems they add tend to be ones that encourage a physician to consider an alternative diagnosis and consequently an alternative treatment trajectory.  And, physicians hear parents as encouraging them to pursue alternative trajectories and typically respond in this way."
0,"This paper locates Filipino labor migration to the United States within the colonial power relations that followed the American annexation of the Philippines in 1898. I illustrate how Filipino immigrants were stratified within the American social formation along intersecting lines of race, nation, and class that refelcted the hierarchical division of labor in the capitalist world economy. Particular attention is given to the role of the 'racial state' in instituting immigration and nationality controls that equated whiteness with citizenship and defined Filipinos as a racially distinctive category of the national labor supply. This paper demonstrates the how the 'racial state' excluded Filipinos from membership in the national community by delimiting their access to citizenship, family formation, and land ownership through exclusionary racial criteria."
0,"Practices of design, although integral to contemporary capitalism, are too often overlooked by economic sociologists. To remedy this, I study a novel technology of organizational adornment: theming. Case data drawn from the global casino industry reveal that theming has diffused worldwide as standard business practice. Close examination, however, reveals divergence across jurisdictions in terms of the meanings that themes convey. These patterns derive from neither successful marketing (i.e., customizing design for consumers) nor symbolic isomorphism (i.e., signaling deference to global norms). In line with the markets-as-politics paradigm, I analyze design as a field-specific conception of control. In this view, themes signal to particular constituencies that one is a certain kind of organization (and not another). The makeup of these signals and audiences-that is, what counts as socially legitimate action-will depend on the political field in which a firm is embedded. Results demonstrate the explanatory power of markets-as-politics and also extend this theory by elucidating the performative mechanisms that bridge economic and political domains."
0,"Disability policies in Israel have created a number of categories of disability, all of which receive different benefits, including disabled veterans, disabled police officers, Jews injured while serving in any army which fought against the Nazis during World War Two, Jews injured while fighting the British during the period of the British Mandate, civilian victims of the Nazis who were not eligible for reparations from Germany, Jews persecuted for Zionist beliefs, families with children while one family member served in the armed forces, and civilians injured in terrorist attacks.  Those which are related to wars or nationalism receive more benefits than those which are not.  This paper examines the relationship between these policies and disability protests which have occurred since 1973.  Using event history analysis, it traces 34 protests and analyzes their characteristics, including types of demands, types of disabilities, targets, length and success.  The results lead to two questions:  why the protests increased in frequency when they did and not before, and why the protests have not formed a disability rights movement.  Some of the reasons suggested include organizational structures around disability, cultural values, and the progression of protest successes and failures."
0,"Although the ""myth"" about the immigration and crime link is one of immigrant propensity for criminality in the United States, contradictory evidence suggests that immigrants, including youth, are less likely to be deviant. Little is known, however, about the multilevel relationships between immigration, schools, and student misbehavior. Analyses, which draw from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) analysis, indeed reveal imperative findings. Most notably, first-generation immigrant students are less likely to misbehave while at school; however, increased exposure to school social disorder is associated with student misbehavior for first-generation immigrants. This article also discusses the importance of understanding the role of immigration in the multilevel relationship of student misbehavior for one of the fastest growing segments of American society: the children of immigrants."
0,"Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy, scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds significance for different populations with competing political agendas (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely characterized as 'political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race. Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance of these developments."

Our focus is on the experiences of citizens living in African countries where famine remains a serious threat. ha government It is effective, it will be able to deliver goods that individuals need to improve their social welfare. At a minimum, effective governments facilitate reliable access to food for its citizens. We assess this conception of effective government via a multi-level model horn 17 sub-Saharan countries sampled in 2005 by Afrobarometer. We find that citizens who live in regions and in countries with a civil bureaucracy, reliable law enforcement and good infrastructure enjoy higher levels of food security than those who live in regions with weaker institutional penetration"
0,"Recent studies indicate that the growth of earnings inequality in the United States since the late 1970s reflects organizational changes in the process of earnings determination. Existing research primarily focuses on workplace changes that reduce earnings levels for middle- and low-wage workers despite the importance of high-wage gains for rising inequality. This paper investigates how organizational context affects the relationship between occupation and earnings, with a focus on high-wage occupations. The earnings associated with low-wage occupations do not vary across industry groups. By contrast, the earnings advantages associated with high-wage occupations vary across industry groups in relation to the industry's prevalence of performance pay practices. Pay initiatives that reward individuals for company performance explain much of the inter-industry variance in managerial and professional earnings slopes. The growth of performance-based pay represents an organizational change in earnings determination that may serve as a mechanism of high-wage earnings growth and rising inequality. "
0,"In this paper, I implement an exploratory discrete-time hazard analysis of the determinants of exit from public housing using the 1996 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). My results show that the median time of exit from public housing is twenty-one months with race and age having significant negative effects on the hazard of leaving public housing. I find no impact of earnings, welfare benefits or the states unemployment rate on the duration of spells in public housing. In addition, time spent in public housing is not a significant predictor of exit from it."
0,"Last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) originated as a way of replacing missing measurements for use in classical repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) where complete data are required. As mathematical statisticians developed newer methods in the attempt to deal effectively with missing data, LOCF fell largely by the wayside. This paper reports use of simulation methods to evaluate validity of tests of significance for differences in mean rates of change applied to LOCF-completed data and compares results with those from alternative procedures that do not require replacement of the missing values for dropouts. Across several different data structures and dropout mechanisms, tests of significance for difference in means of slope coefficients fitted to LOCF data maintained appropriate Type 1 error protection. In no case where the Type 1 error rates of more complex generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) tests appeared appropriately conservative did the power of those tests exceed power of the simpler test on LOCF-completed data.

0,"Why do certain domains of knowledge grow fast while others grow slowly or stagnate? Two distinct theoretical arguments hold that knowledge growth is enhanced by knowledge specialization and knowledge brokerage. Based on the notion of recombinant knowledge growth, we show that Specialization and brokerage arc opposing modes of knowledge generation, the difference between them lying in the extent to which homogeneous vs. heterogeneous input ideas get creatively recombined. Accordingly, we investigate how both modes of knowledge generation can enhance the growth of technology domains. To address this question, we develop an argument that reconciles both specialization and brokerage into a dynamic explanation. Our contention is that specializing in art increasingly homogeneous set of input ideas is both more efficient and less risky than brokering knowledge. Nevertheless, specializing implies progressively exhausting available recombinant possibilities, while brokerage creates new ones. Hence, technology domains tend to grow faster when they specialize, but the more specialized they become, the more they need knowledge brokerage to grow. We cast Out: Our argument into five hypotheses that predict how growth rates vary across technology domains."
0,"C. Wright Mills laid down a complex, contradictory legacy. Worldwide, he may be America's most famous sociologist, yet the professional journals rarely cite his work. In contrast, introductory sociology textbooks almost always discuss the sociological imagination, yet characteristically refer to only half of his concept, hardly ever mentioning its revolutionary character. Both the American Western and the murder mystery reveal parallels with Mills's biography and analysis of American sociology. Mills attempted to murder his father and older brother figures and invited us to join him, but he failed to rally our support. He left a legacy as much iconic as ironic."
0,"Despite decades of research, little is known about the contours of material hardship and how the social processes underlying specific domains of hardship are similar and different. We use qualitative interview data to examine five different domains of material hardship: housing, bill-paying, food, medical, and clothing hardships. While mothers use social program participation, reliance on social networks, and individual strategies to mitigate hardships, the dominance of these strategies and their specific applications differ across hardship domains. These results complement recent research that identifies each domain of hardship as unique and suggest that domain-specific hardship mitigation approaches are necessary."
0,"The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) authorized drug testing of welfare recipients as an additional criterion for assistance eligibility. This raises the question as to whether there is a possible confluence between the War on Drugs and Welfare Reform policies. Discourse is a powerful tool used throughout the policy process, contributing to the social construction of policy target populations. This study examines federal-level policymakers’ discourses surrounding the authorization for drug testing welfare recipients to establish whether and to what extent social pathology discourses associated with the War on Drugs infiltrated and informed Welfare Reform policy to justify drug testing welfare recipients. The analysis reveals that social pathology discourse is apparent and parallel in both policy areas. Crime and drug addiction, poverty and welfare dependency, and drug testing discourses are comparable in both policy debates. Discourse regarding teen pregnancy, out-of-wedlock birth, and female-headed households was more central to Welfare Reform, with the exception of drug-addicted newborns, which crossed both policy streams."
0,"Why do some social movement leaders work harder than others? And, how does gender affect the patterns we uncover? Utilizing historical case study evidence of local chapters in the emerging movement opposing drinking and driving we are able to develop and test theoretical expectations about predictors of weekly effort among MADD and RID leaders. Taken together, our model explains 45 percent of the variation in leadership effort. We find bureaucratic complexity and victim support activities are more powerful predictors of effort than are individual leader characteristics, although all are important. Further analysis reveals that gender almost wholly conditions the strong effect of bureaucratic complexity on leadership effort so that increasingly complex chapter structures are associated with substantial increases in work hours for women but not men."

0,"Much research has concluded that human rights treaties have a null or negative effect on governments’ human rights practices. Using two-stage regression models that account for the endogeneity of treaty membership, I re-examine the effect of human rights treaties, with a focus on two kinds of treaty effects: direct—the effect of treaties on the countries that ratified them; and diffuse—the effect of treaties on countries whether they ratify or not. My analysis of two prominent human rights treaties finds that they often reduce levels of repression and abuse (1) over time and (2) independently of ratification. Many of these effects are nonlinear, reversing direction as time elapses or more countries become party to the treaties. These findings are interpreted with reference to world polity institutionalism in sociology, and especially the “Durkheimian” strains of this approach. Human rights norms as embodied in treaties operate as a “civil religion” for world society. These norms not only have long-term direct effects among countries that ritualistically ratify human rights treaties, but also diffusely impact countries regardless of formal endorsement."
0,"Where do associations come from? The authors argue that the expansion and openness of state institutions encourage the formation of associations. Moreover, the institutional structures of world society provide important resources and legitimation for association. Longitudinal cross-national data on voluntary associations are analyzed using panel models with fixed-effects and instrumental variables models to address possible endogeneity. Institutional features of the state and the structures of world society are linked to higher levels of association, as are wealth and education. These factors differentially affect specific types of association, helping make sense of the distinctive configurations of civil society observed around the globe."
0,"The welfare state promises to moderate the duration and concentration of poverty. The authors ask how well this promise has been fulfilled in the United States and Britain from 1993 to 2003. They examine two aspects of poverty vulnerability during this period of welfare reform: (1) its persistence and associated risk factors and (2) the efficacy of social transfers. After accounting for measurement error, sociodemographic characteristics, and the impact of redistributive programs, the authors find that poverty is often persistent and risk is concentrated, especially in the United States. Moreover, the British safety net appears to better protect those at risk."
0,"This paper is an ethnomethodologically-informed ethnographic analysis of product innovation management practices in a large, complex corporation.  We explore the organizational dynamics resulting in the outcome that management repeatedly rediscovers the same innovation problems and lessons with unsatisfactory evidence of improvements.  In spite of an awareness of the problems they want to address and repeated efforts over several decades to address these problems, the corporation has not been able to change the companys culture around the management of new product innovation.  Our preliminary results suggest that there is an unwritten code of behavior which unnecessarily limits the potential for success of cultural change efforts designed to promote new product innovation orientations.  In this paper we will describe elements of  this code of behavior, and show that they are deeply embedded in managerial work practices at various levels of the hierarchy.  We will show that even when managers are aware of these counter-productive attitudes and beliefs, they still guide work practices in the corporation.  The data site for this study is a large corporation with several divisions.  Data include observations of meetings, interviews, and internal documents.  In addition, the workplace practices involved in managements role in new product innovation will be directly examined, using one division of the corporation as a case study.  This paper is a preliminary draft of ongoing research prepared for consideration for presentation at the ASAs 2004 Annual meeting."

This study takes a symbolic interactionist approach to interactions between Mainland Chinese and American individuals in order to better understand how subjective meanings related to nation, identity, duty and status are employed and created within these interactions.  Special attention is paid to those interactions which involve discussion of sensitive topics related to the subject’s home country.  This study identifies four modes in which people commonly experience and deal with cross-national interaction.  Also discussed are how personal background and situational factors affect the subject’s mode of experience."
0,"Research consistently demonstrates that females engage in less criminal behavior than males across the life course, but research on the variability of the gender gap across contexts is sparse. To address this issue, we examine the gender gap in self-reported violent crime among adolescents across neighborhoods. Multilevel models using data from the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) indicate that the gender gap in violent crime decreases as levels of neighborhood disadvantage increase. Furthermore, the narrowing of the gender gap is explained by gender differences in peer influence on violent offending. Neighborhood disadvantage increases exposure to peer violence for both sexes, but peer violence has a stronger impact on violent offending for females than for males; this produces the reduction in the gender gap at higher levels of disadvantage. We also find that the gender difference in the relationship between peer violence and offending is explained, in part, by (1) the tendency for females to have more intimate friendships than do males and (2) the moderating effect of peer intimacy on the relationship between peer violence and self-reported violent behavior."
0,"In 1999, the Japanese Parliament passed  a revised Animal Protection Law (Doubutsu Aigo Kanri Hou). This new law permits  criminal prosecution for  ""cruelty"" and ""neglect"" of animals. Before this law's enactment, prosecution was possible for abuse of other's animals, but not abuse of those in one's possession. Irresponsible dog owners were free to abuse their own pets without legal or civil  repercussions.   This new law authorizes the arrest and prosecution of willful abuse and neglect regardless of ownership. This paper will examine the law's effectiveness--the reaction of police and other authorities--to a case of outright  abuse and negligence  which resulted in the death of many dogs."
0,"In the literature on Black/White multiracial families, there is a significant group of families missing from most research. These are households that are lead by a single parent of a biracial child. While data on the relative prevalence of single parenthood in multiracial populations is sparse, my research indicates that a significant percentage of multiracial families are headed by single parents. Nearly half of the Black/White biracial infants and toddlers in my study where born to a unmarried parent (National Maternal and Infant Health Survey 1988, 1991).  This study also indicates that these families are much like other single parent families demographically.  In most cases they fall somewhere between black and white single parent households; however, in areas where there are differences they tend to be closer to African American families."
0,"Throughout the past several decades, women in Latin America joined guerrilla armies in great numbers.  This powerful and unprecedented mobilization has been explained through structural changes in womens gender roles and the emergence of new political and religious organizations that mobilized women.  However, of the many women experiencing these structural changes, and of the many women embedded in these new mobilizing networks, only a portion actually made the move into guerrilla camps.  The question of what specifically distinguishes participants from non-participants is left unanswered, in part because the data necessary for making the distinction has not previously been collected, and in part because current models of micromobilization do not adequately capture the complexity of micromobilization decisions, especially in a situation of societal upheaval.  This project combines better data with an expanded theoretical model to examine the various processes that led women to the guerrilla camps in El Salvador.  The results of the analysis not only provide the first micro-level explanation of womens mobilization into guerilla armies, but also demonstrate new ways of thinking about and modeling individual-level variation in all types of movement mobilization.    Specifically, I argue that the interaction of identity, biography, and resources can produce very different routes to participation among individuals embedded in similar networks."
0,"Previous research indicates that race, crime, and social class are linked in both the empirical reality of the contemporary U.S. and in the minds of its citizens.  The cognitive bridges between these factors facilitates a process whereby an individuals evaluations of one factor to influence her evaluation of other factors.   Previous scholarship indicates that the salient criminals race has an impact on support for subjects opinions on punitive criminal justice policies.  By providing subjects with vignettes describing crime scenarios and then probing their punishment preferences for that situation, this paper builds on the previous literature in three ways.  First, it replicates previous findings indicating that the salient perpetrators race influences opinions, but broadens the scope by including Hispanic criminals.  Second, it examines the impact of the criminals social class on subjects punishment preferences.  Third, it analyzes the combined effect of the salient criminals race and social class on subjects opinions.  The results indicate that the salient criminals race and social class are consequential for subjects punishment preferences.  When considering homicide offenses, subjects exposed to Black or Hispanic lower class criminals were more likely to opt for the death penalty than subjects exposed to race and class neutral criminals.  When considering drug possession offenses, subjects exposed to White or Black upper class criminals were less likely to prefer the longest possible prison sentence than subjects in the control condition."
0,"This article places the choice to claim welfare benefits in a social context by studying how neighborhood welfare receipt affects welfare receipt among couples in Stockholm, Sweden. It is expected that the propensity to claim welfare should increase with welfare use in the neighborhood, primarily through stigma reduction and increasing availability of information. 1 use individual-level panel data (N = 1,595,843) for the Stockholm County population during the 1990s, data that contain a wide range of information and allow extensive controls for observed and unobserved confounding factors. The results from pooled and fixed-effects logistic regressions suggest that welfare receipt among people in the same neighborhood substantially increases the number of households entering the welfare system (inflow), but the effects on outflow are negligible."
0,"Retrospective questions on educational attainment in national surveys and censuses tend to over-estimate high school graduation rates by 15-20% points relative to administrative records. Administrative data on educational enrollment are, however, only available at the aggregate level (state, school district, and school levels) and the recording of inter-school transfers are generally incomplete. With access to linked individual-level administrative records from a very large ""West Coast metropolitan school district"" we track patterns of high school attrition and on-time high school graduation of individual students. Even with adjustments for the omission of out-of-district transfers (estimates of omission are presented), the results of this study show that failure in high school, as indexed by retention and attrition, are almost as common as on-time high school graduation. In addition to the usual risk factors of disadvantaged background, we find that the ""9th grade shock""-an unpredicted decline in academic performance upon entering high school-is a key mechanism behind the continuing crisis of high school attrition.

0,"The U.S. housing crisis of the last six years decreased the number of homeowners in neighborhoods across the country.  This examination explores perceptions of homeowners and renters in one such locale where home ownership has been a symbol of neighborhood identity for 125 years.  Research completed in 2010 found that current home owners point to the increasing number of rental properties and renters themselves as leading to social disorganization in the neighborhood, and connect increasing renters with increasing crime.  This resident perception is in contrast with neighborhood data indicating that as renting households and home foreclosures have increased over the last decade, both property and violent crime (indicators of social disorganization) have significantly decreased.  And while renters share home owners concerns regarding neighborhood crime, they don’t connect renters with crime.  It is suggested that the strong cultural value of home ownership as an indicator of stability is a powerful influence on home owner perceptions of neighborhood social disorganization."
0,"This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 to examine the role of cognitive skills and socioemotional traits in individual patterns of educational assortative mating in adolescence and adulthood. I argue that individual differences in skills and traits may be a key channel through which intergenerational mobility operates at the intimate level of mate selection process, because socioemotional traits represent a form of cultural capital and alongside cognitive skills, are highly contingent on family socioeconomic status. Results show that cognitive skills and socioemotional traits are positively associated with transitioning into marrying college graduates and, to a lesser degree, with dating college-bound partners. I also find a gender difference in the role of individual skills and traits: socioemotional traits play a more salient role in education-based mate sorting for women, whereas it is cognitive skills that primarily do so for men, indicating a normative attitude toward mate selection that regards smartness as more attractive to women than to men. These findings imply that the intergenerational transmission of familial resources impacts offsprings mate selection not simply by affecting educational attainment but also by differentiating socially desirable skills and traits."
0,"Using a unique dataset on the geographic distribution of reported protest events from local sources, the study explains the variation in community-level mobilization in response to neoliberal reforms in two countries in the global periphery. Building on insights from macro, cross-national studies of protests related to market reforms, this article highlights local structural conditions that more likely generate popular contention in poorer countries. Count regression models show that localities with greater levels of state and community infrastructure (highways, administrative offices, universities, NGOs and local chapters of oppositional parties) were associated with heightened collective action opposing the privatization of health care and public utilities. These state and community infrastructures were shaped by national contexts in the era of state-led development preceding the current epoch of accelerated globalization."
0,"This article examines the classic question of how religious diversity in a community affects church membership in a period of high growth and social change. Using panel data on local U. S. communities from 1890 to 1926, the authors estimate models specified to overcome likely artifactual problems, deal with unobserved community-specific heterogeneity, and model state dependence. In general, the findings support the plausibility of mechanisms based on pluralistic deobjectivation and identity activation; they do not support predictions from mechanisms based on organization-environment matching and interdenominational competition. The findings also show that the overall effect of urbanization on church participation was positive in all but the most religiously diverse communities."
0,"It has been argued that contemporary dance cultures in Britain have fostered new social connections across the social divides of class, gender, ethnicity and sexuality. In particular, it has been claimed that club cultures constitute important sites for the reconfiguration of gender and sexuality. This paper addresses the question as to what implications current trends towards the fusion of straight and gay club cultures have for the negotiation of sexual identities. By comparing two London dance clubs (a gay-mixed and lesbian venue), it argues that sexual boundary work (Lamont & Molnár, 2002) remains central in dance cultural spaces. The analysis is placed within an elaboration of the wider issues impacting on the reproduction of club cultural economies and on their positioning on the night-clubbing market. It touches upon the promotion and image work, the activation of boundaries in the door-policies and in the social interactions inside the clubs. While experiences of the womens club were structured by highly symbolically marked in-group/out-group distinctions, the gay-mixed club provoked more hybrid and ambiguous boundaries disrupting a surface-depth model of identity. Nevertheless, the queering and allegorization of bodies through practices of aestheticisation remained tied to their re-symbolization which helped reinforce cultural repertoires of recognition."
0,"Most sociological theories consider murder an outcome of the differential distribution of individual, neighborhood, or social characteristics. And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident-level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic-like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents."
0,"A starting point in effective sexual assault program design requires understanding how the audience perceives sexual assault. One of the key constructs identified for understanding sexual assault is rape myths. The current research sought to examine the degree to which military academy students continue to endorse rape myths. Participants were first year students from either the United States Military Academy (n = 1169: men = 1003, women = 166) or the United States Naval Academy (n = 914: men = 722, women = 192). All participants completed the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale – Short Form. Overall, the results indicate that the majority of participants reported a general disagreement with the rape myth statements. However, variation in the level of rape myth acceptance was evident across items. Notable levels of agreement were evident for items that focused on holding the victim responsible and those that excuse the perpetrator by suggesting that he couldn’t help himself. Consistent with previous research, men reported higher levels of rape myth acceptance than women. The results suggest that rape myths continue to influence the beliefs and attitudes that military academy students have about sexual assault. Implications for sexual assault education programs are discussed."
0,"Although little explored in sociology, visits to the optician form a major part of healthcare practice and social life. This paper discusses the key issue of interaction during visits to the optician, using video data collected as part of an ongoing conversation analytic (CA) project. Analysis of opening phases in the consultation indicates that during interactions that accomplish the start of the encounter, the optician and patient discuss eye health and vision in particular ways. They do not refer to the quality of eyes alone; instead they give specific examples of using eyes, for example reading print, seeing signs and driving. These references mark a relationship between the eyes and the external environment. Problems are reported in terms of a reduced ability to perform everyday activities within this environment. As patients often attend these consultations for routine purposes, they may not have any new problems to report. In these cases opticians tend to ask further questions that pursue the possibility a problem may exist and treat the patient’s report as potentially incomplete or inaccurate. This is one of a number of ways in which the institutional nature of the interaction becomes visible in interaction. These findings suggest themes for further analysis as well as implications for practice."
0,"We attempt to lay the foundations for a critical human ecology (CHE) that combines the strengths of the human ecology tradition in environmental sociology with those of historical materialism.  We develop our case for the importance of a critically informed human ecology by examining its position vis-à-vis critical theories with respect to three key meta-theoretical issues: materialist versus idealist conceptualizations in the social sciences, the respective importance and roles of historical and ahistorical causal explanations, and the difference between structuralist and functionalist interpretations of phenomena.  CHE breaks with the idealism of Western Marxism that has dominated academic neo-Marxist thought, advocating the pursuit of a materialist, scientific methodology in dialectical perspective for the explanation of social and ecological change.  In turn, this project also involves critiquing the ahistorical and functionalist aspects of traditional human ecology.  We explore the theoretical potential of critical human ecology for analyzing the sustainability of human populations."
0,"Most comparative studies of contemporary Western family change focus on aggregate differences between countries in levels and timing of fertility and marriage or in non-marital childbearing.  The US literature focuses instead on important within-country differences (education, race/ethnicity) in patterns of family changespecifically longer delays by more educated women, and greater prevalence of non-marital childbearing among less educated women.  This paper will apply the US approach to comparative research, and thus compare patterns of within-country change across countries.  I will examine the extent compositional changes (increased female educational attainment) explain demographic changepreliminary results presented here demonstrate the importance of accounting for educational composition when studying demographic chagne.  In addition, I will consider whether patterns of demographic change differ within country by educational attainment.  Results thus far suggest that the US pattern of educational differences in fertility timing changes can be found in other countries (e.g. Spain), but not all (e.g. Norway)."
0,"When exploring sexual categorization, scholars are beginning to incorporate concepts relevant to fluidity to better reflect and describe peoples sexual lives. From a theoretical perspective, categories such as gay, lesbian, bisexual and heterosexual are no longer viewed as mutually exclusive. This paper explores this notion of identity fluidity by focusing on the phenomenon of self-identified lesbian women who have moved from relationships with female partners to relationships with male partners. The aim of this paper is to highlight the extent to which our preoccupation with behavior and behavioral consistency has influenced how we understand fluidity and even more so, how we understand sexual orientation as a whole. This work proposes a new way to understand fluidity in sexual orientation that is believed to be more sensitive to the complex ways in which individuals organize their sexual selves."
0,"Researchers have explored the considerable negative effect of an individual's or his spouse's poor health on their wealth accumulation. Health selection may also operate across generations, affecting the wealth of children whose parents suffer from poor health. We develop an intergenerational model of health selection in wealth using life course theory to understand whether parents' non-fatal serious health events affect inter vivos financial transfers to children. First, we estimate the relationship between parents' serious health events in adulthood and wealth accumulation, showing that data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study reproduce results from research using U.S. national panel studies and supporting the generalizability of our intergenerational health selection results. Second, we find strong evidence of intergenerational health selection. Individuals with less initial wealth and who experience a serious health event are about 34% more likely to transfer money to their children and transfer 60% more money to their children when they do.

0,"The prevalence of gender wage disadvantages in academic work is well-documented, but patterns of motherhood penalties or fatherhood premiums have been less explored among college and university faculty.  Where the influence of marriage or parenthood on faculty careers has been studied, the focus more typically has been on publication productivity than salary. In addition, women faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields have also been the focus of numerous studies, since these fields are identified as critical areas for recruitment of women. In this study, we examine the effects of marital and parental status on the salaries of men and women faculty in STEM disciplines and academia generally. We find that marriage and children are linked to increased earnings among women outside of STEM and men both within and outside STEM, although patterns vary between groups and increases are more strongly linked to marriage than children. Salaries for women faculty in STEM, however, are not affected by marital or parental statuses, even when discipline, scholarly productivity, institution type, and professional age are taken into account. We explore these findings an"
0,"The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of individual characteristics, labor market sectors and the community (MSAs) characteristics on earnings of Chinese American women using the 1990 5 percent- PUMS data. The individual characteristics are age, educational attainment, English ability and labor market condition, and the MSA characteristics include core industrial dominance and the relative size of Asian American population. Guided by the perspectives from the human capital, labor market segmentation theory and human ecology, this study is an attempt to integrate both the individual and MSA variables via Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM). The multilevel results indicate that investment in human capital contributed to the earnings attainment of Chinese American women. Workers in core sectors tend to earn more than those in periphery sectors. While core industrial dominance contributes to the earnings attainment, the relative size of Asian population does not show any effect on earnings. The results also suggest that most of the variance in earnings lies in the individual characteristics.The limitations of the study are also discussed."
0,"This study advances the sociological inquiry on social categories by synthesizing two lines of research in economic and organizational sociology - studies of industrial categories in market dynamics and neo-institutional analyses of social categories. It compares the classificatory schemes and structures in the California and French wine industries and investigates the impact of institutionalized categories on social evaluation via the lens of determinants of wine price. Empirical findings show that under distinct classification systems, similar categories and wine attributes have different significances and affect wine price differently. These findings shed light on the profound consequences of the organizations and structures of categories in classification systems. They also enrich the institutional analyses by demonstrating that institutional categories systematically differentiate market products and create social differences and hierarchies."
0,"Debates over immigration's impact on less advantaged native workers often ignore industrial structure for creating segregated labor markets and demand for immigrant workers. We analyze population movements of less-educated foreign-born Hispanic, native-born Hispanic. White, and Black men between 1995 and 2000 using MIGPUMA-level 2000 PUMS data. We model in-migration, out-migration, and net migration for each group controlling for demographic composition, employment structure, change in employment structure, labor market indicators, and macro contextual measures. Results indicate positive significant relationships between migration patterns of all groups and support labor demand explanations of internal low-skilled migration emphasizing industrial change rather than labor competition.

0,"Following Game Theorys treatment of the PD game, it is well known that rational action in one-shot games can be very different from rational action in repeated games.  This paper seeks to extend the scope of Network Exchange Theory to one-shot exchange structures where behavior is also quite different from that of repeated exchange structures. In repeated  weak power structures, higher power actors use suboptimal relations as threats to inflate payoffs across exchanges.  But we predict that, in one-shot weak power networks, suboptimal relations, are never used.  We also predict that more power develops in repeated than in one-shot structures. New data reported here supports the predictions.  It shows that:1) suboptimal relations are used in repeated and not in one-shot exchange structures, 2) that suboptimal relations in repeated structures are used as threats, and 3) payoffs in repeated structures are distinct and power differences are greater than in one-shot structures."
0,"To investigate the role of body size in social networks, this study estimated cross-nested multilevel network models (p) with longitudinal data from the 16 saturated schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As body mass index increased, the likelihood of being nominated by schoolmates as friends - but not the likelihood of nominating others as friends decreased. This trend was more pronounced among girls. Moreover, similarity in body mass index strongly predicted friendship formation. These findings were not explained by correlates (e.g., academic achievement) of both body size and friendship dynamics. Thus, the connection between body size and high school social relations was largely a function of the stigmatization of heavier body sizes, especially for girls, and of homophily."
0,"A large amount of literature on relationship status, health, and health behavior indicates that marriage conveys health benefits. This literature, however, devotes relatively little attention to two theoretically interesting groups: unmarried cohabiters and married people who do not live with their spouse (""commuters""). The author hypothesizes that the health and health behaviors of these two groups will be intermediate between those of married people and unattached single individuals. Selective support is found for the hypothesis that the health behaviors of commuters are intermediate between those of married people and single people, but no support is found for the hypothesis that the health status of commuters is intermediate between that of married people and single people. Contrary to expectation, cohabiting persons tend to have poorer health status and health behavior than both their married and single counterparts. Also, while much previous research indicates that the health benefits of marriage are greater for men than women, the author finds that lacking a live-in partner (i.e., commuting or being single) appears to be more detrimental for women than men."
0,"We use data from the National Longitudinal Education Study (NELS) to build upon previous research that considered the negative effects of living in mother-only families and stepparent families on the subsequent educational attainment of children. Our results break new ground in finding that although those who lived in a mother-only family are not less likely overall to graduate college than those who lived with two biological parents, they are significantly less likely to graduate college given four-year college attendance even when other important factors are controlled. In addition, we find that those who lived in a stepparent family are less likely overall to graduate college than those who lived with two biological parents when other important factors are controlled. This difference for those who lived in a stepparent family is due to lower chances of four-year college attendance given high school graduation and of college graduation given four-year college attendance."
0,"This paper examines the expansion of technology transfer practices in the university-industry interface in the U.S., utilizing the analytical lens of new economic sociology and neo-institutional analysis of organizations.  It seeks to identify three critical institutional conditions which laid the foundation for a massive expansion of technology transfer practices that occurred in the past three decades.  It argues that the expansion was shaped and accelerated by: 1) the state initiatives that provided strong inducement for universities to adopt these practices, 2) a newly emerged model that defined a new set of roles for research universities, and 3) the advancement of new sciences that blurred the boundaries between science and technology.  In the empirical analysis of one hundred American research universities, I propose to examine two-related phenomena: the incorporation of a new organizational arrangement, so-called technology transfer office, into universities, and the expansion of the licensing of university-generated technologies to the industry.  The analysis will specify three mechanisms by which these practices have spread in American research university community: 1) the social influence among research universities, 2) the status-mediated contagion, and 3) the regional influence that promote entrepreneurialism."
0,"This study examines the role of ""ecological threat"" in shaping the U.S. environmental movement. Statistical analysis combines founding data on 772 national environmental movement organizations with ecological data on air pollution levels and amphibian and bird populations. We examine these data longitudinally, from 1962 through 1998. Net of other social, economic, and political factors suggested by social movement theory, we find evidence of segmented effects in the expected directions: Declines in wildlife populations are associated with the foundings of wildlife and wilderness protection organizations while increases in air pollution are associated with the foundings of organizations focused on ecosystem well-being and public health. These findings help refine long-held assumptions about the relationship between ecological degradation and environmental activism, and demonstrate the broader utility of the threat concept for strengthening theories of social movement mobilization."
0,"Social movement organizations and nonprofit organizations can affect local communities in numerous ways, some of which are intended and some of which are unintended.  Assessing the impact of these organizations is complicated because the effect that an organization has on a community depends on other attributes of the community in which it is embedded.  This article draws attention to the importance of multiorganizational fields in determining social movement consequences through an analysis of hate crime enforcement and reporting in U.S. Counties.  Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), in combination with more traditional statistical techniques, identifies 14 configurations of variable attributes that almost always result in reported hate crimes.  The analysis shows how measures of civil rights activism, political opportunities, grievances, and multiorganizational fields combine in local settings to produce hate crime reporting with near certainty.  Results indicate that the resourcefulness, heterogeneity, and funding sources of the nonprofit sector play a key role in determining whether hate crimes are reported."
0,"The addition of multiracial categories to large surveys has the potential to improve our understanding of racial inequality in the United States.  Using the third wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I show that multiracial groups do differ significantly from single-race groups on educational outcomes including vocabulary test scores and college enrollment.  Many of these racial gaps are explained by differences in family background, such as parental education and family income. Measures of appearance are also investigated in an effort to understand how outsiders view single-race and multiple-race individuals, and how resulting differences in treatment may influence their educational outcomes.  I show that measures of skin color do not explain all of the differences between single-race and multiple-race groups, and that multiracial individuals have significant differences from others classified into the same observed racial group."

0,"Using data from Add Health, this Study investigates the role of neighborhood violence in mediating the effects of neighborhood disadvantage on high school graduation and teenage pregnancy. Results show that neighborhood violence is a strong predictor of both outcomes, net of individual, family, community and school controls. Neighborhood violence accounts for almost half the conditional association between neighborhood disadvantage and high school graduation among males and almost all of the association among females. Violence also accounts for about a fifth of the conditional association between disadvantage and teenage pregnancy among adolescents of both genders. Violence is a critical social characteristic of disadvantaged neighborhoods, one that explains a sizable portion of the effects of growing LIP in such neighborhoods."
0,"Drawing from a life course perspective and on the basis of in-depth life narratives of male and female three-generation lineages, with the same relative unqualified and poor point of departure, from urban Lisbon and a rural, semi-industrialized village in northern Portugal, we identify three main processes of social mobility: low accumulation, loss of accumulation and continuous accumulation. Rather than just reproducing class positions inter-generationally, these processes are also the result of the relation between advantageous and disadvantageous life course events, whose effects are differential and cumulative across the generations, as they produce specific logics of resource appropriation and transmission."
0,"Despite a growing interest in cultural movements, social movement scholars maintain a narrow definition of activists. This paper investigates participants in the vegan movement who are not members of a social movement organization. Using data from in-depth ethnographic interviews with twenty-four vegans, I found that these unaffiliated vegan activists actually had two different ways of defining and practicing veganism and that these differences corresponded with the participants subcultural affiliation. Punks practiced a strict form of veganism, whereas nonpunks adhered to looser definitions of veganism. Taking a relational approach to the data, I analyzed the two groups social networks to attempt to explain their differing definitions and practices of veganism. I argue that that maintaining a vegan lifestyle depends less upon willpower, motivation, or a collective vegan identity, and depends more on three aspects of their social networks: discourse, support, and network embeddedness. This study explores the impact of social networks on unorganized and diffuse cultural movement participants."
0,"This study seeks to contribute towards a theory of government and nonprofit collaboration. Previous work has noted the growing reliance on nonprofits to provide government services, particularly at the state and local levels. Of concern in this study is the degree to which non-profits are able to maintain their autonomy working in a bureaucratic system. This analysis focuses on three nonprofit organizations that provide pretrial release and diversion services in a local criminal justice system. Organizational theory offers a useful set of concepts that will describe how non-profits relate to their government sponsor: co-optation, tight coupling and loose coupling. These basic relational forms are determined by the non-profits' procedural or substantive orientation as well as the social legitimacy attached to the client population. The findings indicate that non-profit programs guided by procedural orientations tend to be more co-opted (and therefore have less autonomy) and the non-profit programs that are guided by substantive orientation tend to be coupled (and thus granted greater autonomy). This suggests that the ability of a nonprofit to maintain its autonomy in a bureaucratic system is determined by organizational arrangements and other contextual indicators."
0,"Recent studies report significant cross-national variation in the conceptual distinctions or ""symbolic boundaries"" used by majority groups to construct notions of ""us"" and ""them."" Because this literature compares only a handful of countries, the macro-level forces by which certain symbolic boundaries become more salient than others remain poorly understood. This article provides the first panorama of these processes by comparing the relative salience or ""configuration"" of multiple symbolic boundaries in 21 European countries. I use fuzzy-set analyses of data from the 2003 European Social Survey to create a typology of symbolic boundary configurations. The results indicate that the symbolic boundaries deployed by the general public do not correspond to the official ""philosophies of integration"" emphasized in the literature. Moreover the data suggest previous comparisons have focused too heavily on Western Europe, overlooking important variation in other regions of Europe where immigration began more recently. I generate hypotheses to explain this newfound variation using demographic, socioeconomic, institutional, and historical data from quantitative and qualitative sources. The article concludes with examples of how these hypotheses can be combined by future studies toward a theory of ""boundary-work."""
0,"This study explores how firms shape labor markets and career paths using employee non-compete agreements. The sociology of work has overlooked non-competes, but data indicate that nearly half of technical professionals in the United States are asked to sign such employment contracts. Fearing loss of investments in talent and trade secrets, firms use non-competes to ""strike back"" against technical professionals' increased mobility following the decline of internal labor markets. In-depth interviews with 52 randomly sampled patent holders in a single industry, coupled with a survey of 1,029 engineers across a variety of industries, reveal that ex-employees subject to non-competes are more likely to take career detours-that is, they involuntarily leave their technical field to avoid a potential lawsuit. Moreover, firms strategically manage the process of getting workers to sign such contracts, waiting for workers' bargaining position to weaken. These findings inform our understanding of the social organization of work in the knowledge economy."

Both of these phenomena are disproportionately experienced by men (Makinen 2000, Webster 2003).

0,"An extensive literature has documented that disadvantaged parental socioeconomic status earlier in life has harmful mental health consequences.  What warrants further inquiry is why.  Using social stress theory and data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study highlights mediating mechanisms from the transition to adulthood that help to explain why there is a long-term relationship between disadvantaged family background and symptoms of depression at ages 29 to 37.  Results indicate that levels of self-esteem at ages 15 to 23 substantially explain the inverse relationship between parental education and subsequent levels of depressive symptoms.  The depressive effect of low parental occupational prestige is largely explained by cumulative exposure to poverty status across 16 years. Overall, the implications of these findings are that policymakers and social welfare interventions should target self-esteem enhancement and the prevention of poverty spells during the journey to adulthood."
0,"This article examines the origins of tax systems. Through a historical comparison of France and the United States, and analysis of several shadow cases, the article explains why the United States has relied more heavily on progressive income taxation than France, which has favored regressive sales taxes. This study traces the origins of these two tax systems to the early 20th century, arguing that decisions about tax structure were shaped by resistance to the concentration of economic power in the United States and the centralization of state power in France. In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of ""fiscal inquisition"" weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th-century movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy."

Using data from the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS), we investigate how gender non-conformity and social status characteristics potentially put some transgender people at greater risk for discrimination and poor health. Our results show that those who are visually gender non-conforming and who belong to disadvantaged groups (transwomen, multiracial and Latino/a, and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds) are more likely to be at risk for discrimination and poor health. We contribute to debates in transgender scholarship about the benefits and consequences of “passing” within transgender communities and seek to document some of the material conditions within the lives of transgender people."
0,"Although social disorganization theory provides a framework for understanding how changes in neighborhoods can influence crime rates over time, research on neighborhood characteristics and crime has relied primarily on cross-sectional data. Using a latent growth curve model and longitudinal data on residential burglary and vehicle theft in Indianapolis, measured annually between 1992 and 2006 at the census block group level, the authors analyzed the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and crime trends. For both residential burglary and vehicle theft, baseline models revealed that changes in crime rates were best captured by a quadratic function with an initial linear decrease and subsequent deceleration ( slowing) of the decrease. When neighborhood characteristics were included as predictors, change in neighborhood disadvantage was significantly related to changes in both residential burglary and vehicle theft over time, while change in residential stability did not have a significant effect on changes in residential burglary or vehicle theft."
0,"Prior research has devoted considerable attention to the relationship between the racial and ethnic composition of jobs and various indicators of organizational attachment. Fewer studies, however, examine how workplace racial composition affects individuals' experiences of racial discrimination or how these experiences impact workers' organizational attachment. To address this lacuna, we first examine the effects of workplace racial composition on perceived racial and ethnic discrimination. Next, we examine whether perceived racial discrimination mediates the association between racial composition and organizational attachment observed in prior studies. Finally, we explore whether these relationships are similar (symmetric) or different (non-symmetric) for non-Whites and Whites. The analyses indicate: (1) working with predominately same-race coworkers tends to diminish perceptions of racial discrimination, (2) perceived racial discrimination mediates some of the effects of racial/ethnic composition on organizational attachment, and (3) some non-symmetric effects between non-Whites and Whites are found. We conclude with implications for future research. "
0,"Typical theories of reactive movement activity conceive of protest as a product of individual-level grievances generated by features of macrostructural environments.  We extend such threat- or competition-based explanations by focusing on the role of inter-and intra-community connections in the mobilization process.  Such connections constitute institutional-level venues for interaction that facilitate or circumscribe individuals participation in contentious political action.  The relational approach employed here extends work on micro-mobilization processes to examine how the patterning of venues within particular socio-spatial units (i.e. communities or counties) explains variation in mobilization rates.  Applying this perspective to the case of the Civil Rights-era Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina, we find that community connectedness plays a significant role in the mobilization process, and highlight the general importance of more fully accounting for meso-level contexts within which non-institutional political action occurs."

We offer a model with three outcomes: in school, pushed out or pulled out. Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Survey, we find that for black students, differences in SES explain higher likelihoods of being either pushed or pulled out as compared to white students, but Latino students remain more likely to be pulled out even after we control for SES. We also find that SES moderates the relationship between race/gender and being pushed out, and that higher levels of SES may be detrimental to students of color in the context of high poverty schools."

0,"The link between migration and STD/HIV risky sexual behavior has been well documented. Research of risky sexual behavior that addresses the issue of gender-migration interaction or employs a multilevel perspective is still limited in China. Using data from a probability survey and applying multilevel modeling, this paper examines gender differences in (1) the link between migration and risky sexual behavior and (2) individual and community correlates of risky sexual behavior. Results suggest significant interaction between gender and migration. Being a temporary migrant is associated with significantly more risky sexual behaviors for females but significantly fewer for males. There are also significant interactions between gender and marriage and living arrangement. Being married and living with others both appear to be more powerful deterrents to risky sexual behavior for females than for males. Single migrant women who live alone have the most risky sexual behaviors while married nonmigrant women who live with others have the least. Risky sexual behavior is further influenced by family and peers and conditioned by community contexts. Prevention programs are urgently needed for female temporary migrants and must address the issue of gender and pay attention to social influences of family and peers and community contexts."
0,"Drawing on the embeddedness, varieties of capitalism and macrosociological life course perspectives, we examine how institutional arrangements affect network-based job finding behaviors in the United States and Germany. Analysis of cross-national survey data reveals that informal job matching is highly clustered among specific types of individuals and firms in the United States, whereas it is more ubiquitous in Germany. These differences are linked to (1. loosely regulated and hierarchical employment relations in the United States that facilitate network dominance in specific economic sectors and (2. coordinated market relations, tight employment regulations and extensive social insurance system in Germany that generate opportunities for informal matching but limit the influence of network behavior on employment characteristics. These findings illustrate how social institutions shape access to economic resources through network relations."
0,"Competition is intricately interwoven into the structural fabric of American schooling: grades, credentials, examinations, tracking, and extra-curricular activities are all aspects of schooling in which competition is a strong yet implicit component (Ames, 1984a; Bennett & LeCompte, 1990). Recent research suggests that messages about the value of competition and/or being competitive in school may also be salient aspects of the socialization process for middle-class children at home (e.g., Kusserow, 2004; Lareau, 2003). While this may be the case, we still know little about what types of activities parents and their adolescent children engage when at home together and how these home experiences relate, if at all, to adolescents feelings of competitiveness in school. One reason for this is that research has paid little attention to the role of parents feelings of competitiveness in their daily livesincluding at work and homeand how these feelings relate to feelings of competitiveness reported by their children at home and at school. This study examines the relationship between parents feelings of competitiveness and the feelings of competitiveness and academic achievement of their children. It is hypothesized that parents who report high degrees of competitive feelings will engage in activities with their children at home which foster competitive feelings at school, and that these competitive feelings at school may be related to higher grades."

Russia of the 18th century witnesses the significant push towards control of emotions as well the increase in the thresholds of shame and repugnance. Similar, though definitely not identical, processes drove these changes in social standards. On the common side, the 18th century is the time of growing state centralization and increasing monopolization of violence by the state. However, it is suggested that in the Russian case, the international context of increased interdependence and competition may have played more significant role than social mobility that is emphasized by Elias. The processual and relative nature of the civilizing process is emphasized. Contemporary relevance of the topic is addressed in the conclusion."

0,"Previous research on China's labor market gender gaps has emphasized the human and political capital disadvantages of women and new discrimination in the reform era. Analyzing the China Urban Labor Survey/China Adult Literacy Survey, this paper shows that while women are significantly disadvantaged by various measures of human and political capital, these disadvantages explain little of the observed gender gaps in employment status and earnings. Instead, gender gaps in employment and earnings are strongly related to family status. It is only married women and mothers who face significant disadvantages. This finding is likely tied to the fact that wives and mothers spend much more time than husbands and fathers doing household chores, even net Of controls for potential earnings. These results suggest that research on gender disparities in urban China would be complemented by additional attention to family-work conflict, a topic which looms large in research on gender and labor in most other countries."

This topic is relevant due to the recent successful, if controversial, FDA-approval and mass marketing campaing for GARDASIL (the cervical cancer vaccine).  The case of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, including the popular I want to be one less commercials, underscores the argument that the de-stigmatization of all STDs is truly needed to achieve improved public health in the U.S.  [The attached summary includes nine key questions that roundtable participants might wish to explore.]"
0,"Bullying has been increasingly identified as a significant social problem. Although much of this attention has centered on the context Of schooling, researchers are now beginning to recognize that workplaces are also arenas rife with abusive, bullying behaviors. Personality attributes of bullies and victims have received attention, but much less research has examined the social and organizational foundations of bullying. In this article, we focus theoretical attention on the importance of status-based power differentials and organizational context for the emergence of supervisory bullying in employment. Our multi-method analyses, which draw from content-coded organizational ethnographies (N=204), highlight the importance not only of structural and social vulnerability-such as being in a racial minority or of a low occupational position-but also of chaotic and disorganized workplaces. Poor workplace organization, we show, creates positive motivations for supervisory bullying. Workplaces without capable guardians create further vulnerabilities to bullying as a managerial control tactic. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications Of our results for understanding social power, organizational dynamics and the ramifications of abuse in the workplace."
0,"Today's Internet search engines are highly effective in returning relevant web pages to users in fractions of seconds. Yet interactions with search engines are far from perfect. When using search engines users experience a variety of troubles, which are still poorly understood. One particular kind of trouble stems from users' prior knowledge about entities of interest, particularly regarding their names. This study examines how referential practice is organized in the context of search-engine interactions. It finds that, as in conversation, users employ naming in their queries to refer to entities if then can. However, when they do not know the name, or a name fails, they attempt a two-stage search: first they search for the name, using generic descriptions combined with an image-matching strategy, and second, if the name is found, they formulate the final query using that name. A novel method – computer interaction analysis – is used to reveal formal features of users' referential practices from recordings of screen video with eye tracking and a distinctive transcription scheme."
0,"We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine how access to financial resources in the extended family affects the accumulation of wealth among non-owners and how these resources subsequently affect transitioning into homeownership. Our findings show that economic conditions of the extended family have substantial effects on non-owners' wealth accumulation and likelihood of becoming homeowners, even after adjusting for individual sociodemographic and economic characteristics. We find significant effects of extended-family wealth for both black and white households, but effects of extended-family income insufficiency for blacks only. Consequently, limited access to wealth and greater level of poverty in the extended family hamper blacks' transition to homeownership. Our results show that the level of extended-family wealth necessary for black householders to equalize their likelihood of becoming homeowners with whites is very high. In fact, our findings indicate that white householders embedded in extended families with no net wealth are just as likely to make the transition to ownership as are black householders with affluent extended families. These findings support arguments related to the importance of extended-family resources in processes of residential attainment but also point to important racial differences in not only levels but also consequences of these family resources.

Specifically, it experimentally manipulates brief news articles to investigate the impact of the race of the perpetrator and type of crime featured on audience members’ endorsement of stereotypes about blacks, beliefs about the percentage of criminals who are black, affect toward blacks, and racial resentment.  Analysis of survey-based experiments conducted as part of the Race Cues, Attitudes, and Punitiveness Study indicates that short crime news articles have a limited impact on whites’ attitudes, and a negligible impact on blacks’ attitudes."
0,"Objective: To determine if female offenders’ scores on a social mores index predict a violent offender using social disorganization theory.  Method: Using data from a 2009 survey at four Oklahoma women’s correctional centers, I averaged scores on the Social Mores Index.  With logistic regression, I calculated odds ratios to describe how scores on the Social Mores Index predict whether the offender is a violent offender or a nonviolent offender. Results: Respondents who scored lower on the Social Mores Index were twice more likely to be a violent offender than those scoring higher on the Index.  When control variables were added to the model, the Social Mores Index continued to have a significant effect on the violent or nonviolent tendencies of the respondent.  Demographic and offense variables did not have a significant effect.  Conclusions: Accordance with norms is an important facet of society.  Although results from inmates cannot be generalized to the population, it is clear that those who hold lower than average norms are more likely to become violent offenders.  Perhaps prison officials or rehabilitation specialists can work with violent female offenders on their recognition and acceptance of societal values."
0,"Eminent domain is the right of governments to seize private property from owners in exchange for just compensation needed for public use.  In the past century, court rulings have steadily expanded the scope of valid eminent domain takings.  In June of 2005, the Supreme Court ruling in Kelo et al. vs. City of New London et. al. determined that governments may force citizens to sell their private property to private third-parties as public good where it may facilitate local economic development.  This extension of eminent domain serves as an enhancing effect on pre-existing growth machines (Logan and Molotch, 1987) in urban spaces.  Furthermore, the ruling jeopardizes urban communities throughout the United States and places a disproportionate burden on those least able to defend against a legal appropriation."
0,"Young adults at the turn of the 21st century came of age in a time of unprecedented access to credit but slowed growth in earnings, resulting in a dramatic increase in indebtedness. Debt has been little studied by sociologists, even though it is increasingly important in financing both attainment and a middle-class lifestyle, especially for youth in the transition to adulthood. We study the consequences of indebtedness for young adults' sense of mastery and self-esteem as stratified by class. Young adulthood is a crucial developmental period for mastery and self-esteem, which then serve as a social psychological resource (or deficit) into the adult years. Research suggests that young people have divergent perspectives on debt: some focus on credit as a necessary investment in status attainment, while others worry that readily available credit invites improvidence that can erode the self-concept as debt encumbers achievement and future consumption and increases a sense of powerlessness. We find that both education and credit-card debt increase mastery and self-esteem, supporting the hypothesis that young people experience debt as an investment in the future, and contradicting the expectation that debt used to finance current spending will lower mastery and self-esteem. Our expectation that debt effects are accentuated for those of lower- and middle-class origins but blunted for those of upper-class origins is supported. We find, however, that the positive effects of debt appear to wane among the oldest young adults, suggesting the stresses of debt may mount with age. We conclude that further study of the long-term consequences of debt will be essential for advancing contemporary stratification theory and research. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"“Decoupling Diversity?” uses the case of the University of Vermont’s (UVM) persistent contention around racial inequality in order to characterize barriers to social change in institutionalized organizations.  This paper identifies decoupling as an organizational strategy attempted by makers of formal policy at UVM.  This paper also explicates how formal policy’s intentional misalignment with technical activity is navigated by diversity “experts” that serve as the mediators on UVM’s campus.   Formal policy, informed by the “business case for diversity”, has implications for the University community that are theoretically and practically in opposition with experts’ “technical tools for transformation”, like self-reflection and trust which are informed by Freirian pedagogy.  The unintended consequence of such opposition is an intra-organizational structure at the University that is uneven and thus elusive to those authentically pursuing racial equity on campus.  Such uneven intra-organizational structure serves as a critique of the general social structure, where privilege and oppression are unevenly reproduced and challenged in institutional environments that dictate organizational structure and thus relational activity."
0,"Over the past twenty-five years, many states in the US have steadily increased high school graduation requirements in mathematics, driven largely by the prompting of the report A Nation at Risk released in 1983. Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), this study investigates the impact of this requirement reform on five outcomes: math course taking, math achievement, math self-efficacy, postsecondary enrollment, and choice of a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) major in college. Results from multilevel modeling indicate that increased graduation requirements are positively associated with math course taking, negatively associated with math achievement, negatively associated with postsecondary enrollment (both 2- and 4- year schools), and not significantly related to the choice of a STEM major. The unintended negative effect of requirement policy on academic achievement is larger on minority student, which raise the issues of inequality in education."
0,"Using 42 in-depth interviews with rural, Southern whites in Mississippi, I examine the intra-racial boundary work respondents use to construct their regional and racial identities in relation to other whites in their communities, particularly rednecks I find that rednecks are defined and categorized in multiple ways based on the respondents conceptions of Southerners social statuses (i e, age, gender, class and residential history), and intra-racial comparisons around these social characteristics Primarily they draw intra-racial distinctions to separate themselves from negative characterizations and to claim positive associations with being rural, Southern whites Nonetheless the multi-faceted intra-racial boundary work around redneck maintains the general hegemony of whiteness by marginalizing lesser whites' and forms of whiteness and claiming an ideal type of whiteness that is considered untainted, normative and superior"
0,"This study traces the development of union loyalties among community college professors. Assuming that activism is motivated by contextual and ideological factors, the paper analyzes the ways that social networks, collegiate workplaces, and framing practices transform political bystanders into committed union members. Using data from a study of junior college professors in Kentucky (N = 329), the study finds that union participation is strongly linked to a distrust of campus administrators and having pro-union friends and colleagues. Likewise, perceptions of union efficacy, a liberal identity as well the professor's education level predicted the actual joining of their campus' faculty union."
0,"Taking a cross-national perspective, we investigate linkages between volunteer work, informal help, and care among Europeans aged 50 or older. Based on 27,297 personal interviews from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we estimate univariate and multivariate probit models, which allow us to analyze the interrelationship between those non-market productive activities. There is substantial variation in the participation in volunteering, helping, and caring between countries. Independent of the general level of activity in a country, we find evidence for a complementary and interdependent relationship between all three activities. Our findings not only suggest an important role of societal opportunity structures in elders' productive engagement, but also support notions of the existence of a general motivation to be active.

0,"Public health experts are beginning to emphasize the socio-cultural factors that may initiate, intensify and spread the incidence of infectious diseases. The term syndemic has been recently introduced as a way to indicate the prevalence of multiple health pathologies that affect specific populations. Public health researchers use this concept to denote multiple epidemics that interact and thus exacerbate the burdens experienced by members of populations who are adversely affected by the identified coinfections present within a syndemic network of disease and illness. This paper will take an initial step towards the sociological application of syndemic theory by drawing from this work in public health. I will argue here that theorizing from a syndemic perspective allows for an alternative model to traditional causal reasoning. In keeping with Webers notion of elective affinities, syndemic theorizing will be shown to be a useful strategy from which to develop explanatory models that are less reliant on causal reasoning and more interested in the synergistic association between variables in social contexts. I will conceptualize structural syndemic theory as a sociological perspective that interprets social phenomenon as a set of synergistic and mutually enhancing factors that develop and coexist at both the structural and cultural levels and that collectively impact the onset, prevalence, and severity of the social phenomenon in question. The paper will close with a brief application of structural syndemic theorizing to the study of juvenile sexual offense."
0,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the ways in which social science data can be collected in virtual environments. In particular, this project focuses on sampling strategies when the population characteristics are not known, therby expanding the methodological toolbox for social science researchers interested in engaging participants in virtual environments. Using the largest virtual world in existence, Second Life, as the virtual platform for data collection, respondents were asked a series of demographic and health-related questions. The most significant contribution of this project is the methods used to design a random sampling frame for individuals in Second Life. A sample of 297 virtual worlds residents completed a survey instrument that contained replicated questions from the NHIS 2009 adult core questionnaire as well as questions designed specifically for this project. Results suggest that attempts at random sampling in virtual environments may not be worth the extra time and cost over convenience sampling methods since the differences between the two samples appear to be relatively slim – only choice of survey language and primary language spoken were significant at the .05 level."
0,"Based on a multilevel analysis of Chinese private enterprises, I argue that on average, social networks do help private firms improve economic performance through legitimating status and securing financial resources, raw materials and sales markets. I also argue that network effects vary under different contexts. That is, networks help private firms improve economic performance more when the market environment is still weak than after the market environment has become strong. Also, network effects are found to have negative relations with economic development in the environment. The results show a tendency of convergence between reforming China and market-developed countries."
0,"Divorce remains one of the main challenges facing American families today. Previous studies have shown that the risk of divorce is influenced by many factors, including spouses' characteristics and the types of neighborhoods in which they live. This study extends previous work by examining the association between household size and divorce rate at the county level using 1990 and 2000 county-level data. The results show that household size is negatively and significantly associated with divorce rate in both 1990 and 2000, regardless of the region of residence. That effect was stronger in 2000, where household size appeared as the second most significant correlate of divorce rate among all other variables considered in the linear multiple regression analysis. Such findings suggest that household size acts as a social capital variable which helps to maintain family structure, thus reducing the risk of union dissolution."
0,"Gentrification is a contentious issue in many U.S. cities, especially when it involves racial turnover; whites moving into previously segregated black neighborhoods leads to concern over the diminishing black community. The black community is discussed in the context of structural racial inequality. Racial boundaries are discussed as social processes of identifying with the neighborhood and ones racial group. We examine the attitudes and opinions of neighborhood change among residents of the newly named Alberta Arts District in Portland, OR, distinguishing between long-time black and white residents, homeowners and renters. Survey results demonstrate racial and tenure status differences in general opinions of change. Interviews reveal that the meaning of this change for long-time black residents is profoundly related to race and the diminishing black community. Despite the property value increases experienced by many long-time homeowners, race remains the most meaningful aspect of change among long-time black residents. Homeownership in this gentrifying neighborhood does not diminish concern over the diminishing black community. These findings demonstrate the continuing prominence and of race as a structuring category of American urban life, and the continuing importance of the black community as a source of identity."
0,"The field of peace and conflict studies is still coalescing, despite the fact that the first undergraduate degree program in the United States was established in 1948. Almost sixty years later, the field still goes by so many names that core identity issues have not been resolved. The names of degree programs reveal various foci: peace studies; justice studies; conflict studies; conflict analysis; conflict resolution; conflict management; conflict transformation; and dispute resolution. This paper recounts the history of the fields development, and then charts and analyzes the curricular content of undergraduate degree programs in the United States and Canada. This is accomplished through analysis of the curricular requirements for those degree programs, as well as through comparative analysis of the syllabi for the required courses in those programs. This data allows us to identify whether and if core constructs have been established in this emerging discipline, and the degree of coherence that may be present in the field."
0,"We examine the changing social and economic characteristics of women who give birth out of wedlock. Using Current Population Survey data collected between 1982 and 2002, we find that never-married mothers remain impoverished Their income growth over these years was modest despite substantial gains in education employment, and other individual characteristics generally associated with prosperity These results affirm the ongoing role of family structure in shaping American inequality "
0,"This article revisits the Moving to Opportunity housing mobility experiment, which heretofore has not provided strong evidence to support the hypothesis of neighborhood effects on economic self-sufficiency among adults. The authors undertake a conceptual and empirical analysis of the study's design and implementation to gain a better understanding of the selection processes that occur within the study. The article shows that the study is potentially affected by selectivity at several junctures: in determining who complied with the program's requirements, who entered integrated versus segregated neighborhoods, and who left neighborhoods after initial relocation. Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self-sufficiency, relative to controls. The authors propose an alternative approach that involves measuring the cumulative amount of time spent in different neighborhood environments. With this method, they find evidence that neighborhood is associated with outcomes such as employment, earnings, TANF receipt, and use of food stamps."
0,"This article investigates how the growth in income inequality from 1970 to 2000 affected patterns of income segregation along three dimensions: the spatial segregation of poverty and affluence, race-specific patterns of income segregation, and the geographic scale of income segregation. The evidence reveals a robust relationship between income inequality and income segregation, an effect that is larger for black families than for white families. In addition, income inequality affects income segregation primarily through its effect on the large-scale spatial segregation of affluence rather than by affecting the spatial segregation of poverty or by altering small-scale patterns of income segregation."
0,"Implicit within contemporary discursive and institutional trends in the European Union is a new agenda for state-society relations, seeking a potentially dramatic reconstruction of state-society relations, in which individuals and organizations outside of the state apparatus play crucial roles in every aspect of the policy process, from agenda-setting and policy formation to policy implementation and evaluation. The state apparatus, in this view, is no longer seen as a bureaucratic ensemble dutifully carrying out the orders of legislators and executives, but rather as a dynamic, reflexive, even experimental entity, resulting from cooperation among state officials at all levels, international organizations, civil society actors, representatives of social groups, and other actors, which constantly reassess, redesign and redeploy problem-solving strategies. This presentation examines this nascent agenda through a case study of the Portuguese experience with the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), an EU policy coordination mechanism that is perhaps the foremost exemplar of this approach. I argue that the OMC has had important effects, encouraging innovative welfare state reforms,  wider participation in the policy process, and shifting power relations among political actors. However, various institutional constraints, at the local, national and international levels, have considerably limited these achievements. After detailing these effects and constraints, I conclude by placing these developments in the context of a theory of institutional change, provisionally outlining several additions to it inspired by my case study."
0,"Social context is increasingly recognized as essential for understanding complex human outcomes even among geneticists who focus on genetic influences. These outcomes typically involve multiple genes, multiple environmental factors, and the interactions between the two. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for gene-environment interaction and show how the interaction can be tested empirically using a sample of MZ twin, DZ twins, and full siblings. We test the hypothesis that the genetic contribution to adolescent drinking depends on the drinking behavior of their friends, using a sample of clusters of siblings and their friends from Add Health. Our analysis has yielded evidence supporting the gene-environment interaction hypothesis. High levels of alcohol use by one's best friend or among one's friends tend to bring about higher levels of genetic contribution to alcohol use. Lower levels of alcohol use by one's best friend or among one's friends tend to suppress the level of genetic contribution to alcohol use. Our findings suggest that friend behavior might be a particularly important environmental moderator of the expression of genetic disposition for adolescent drug use, smoking, dietary habits, and risky sexual behavior. Subsequent studies of these behaviors that use non-DNA twin samples or DNA measures of genetic variants should investigate peer influence as a significant environmental moderator. "
0,"Structuring collective action, given diverse human thoughts, feelings, and behavior, is an arduous task. This article examines one way collective action can be facilitated by analyzing how social movement organizations (SMOs) use narratives as a key resource for recruiting members and sustaining participation. Data for this analysis were collected through participant observation and in-depth interviews with 34 participants of the Soulforce Equality Ride (ER), a cross-country bus journey-modeled after the Freedom Ride of the Civil Rights Movement-that toured 18 schools that ban the enrollment of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students. Findings indicate that the ER recruited participants, maintained commitment to the group and its cause, and met organizational goals by (1) crafting a frame that successfully taps into potential members' existing emotions, ideologies, and experiences; (2) aligning these individual experiences with group messages and meanings via narratives; and (3) creating positive feelings for members. In doing so, SMOs can construct cognitive and emotional links between the individual and the SMO, thereby promoting group goals."
0,"We examine the effects of job displacement, an involuntary event associated with socioeconomic and psychological decline, on social participation. Using more than 45 years of panel data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we find that job displacement is associated with significant, long-term lower probabilities of subsequent involvement with various forms of social participation for workers displaced during their prime earnings years; displacement is not associated with lower probabilities of involvement for workers displaced in the years approaching retirement. We also find that post-displacement socioeconomic and psychological decline explain very little of the negative effect of job displacement on social participation, and that a single displacement event, rather than a series of multiple displacement events, is most strongly associated with lower probabilities Of social involvement."
0,"Is there a relationship between physical limitation and anger proneness? And, if so, to what extent is this relationship conditioned by associated differences in stress exposure and the availability of psychosocial resources? We explore these questions using data from a community study conducted in Miami-Dade County that includes a representative sample of persons with and without physical limitations (N=1,928).  Results of OLS regression demonstrate that physical limitation is associated with an increased tendency to both experience and express anger.  Findings also reveal that variations in stress exposure and the availability of psychosocial resources largely account for these associations. We discuss these findings in consideration of social interactional theories of emotion and the stress process model perspective."
0,"This paper takes up the practice of Chinese medicine in the United States, looking in particular at how Chinese medicine practitioners approach and treat autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases include multiple sclerosis, lupus, and Crohn’s disease, as well many other serious, chronic diseases. The list of autoimmune diseases compiled by Johns Hopkins University and other medical sources includes approximately 80 illnesses. Such illnesses are increasing in incidence in North America. This study contributes to the sociology of medical knowledge and shows how ideas about the body and illness are located in particular social, historical, and political contexts. It draws on in-depth interviews conducted with 20 Chinese medical practitioners in the United States and field work at Chinese medicine classes and conferences to better understand the values and norms in Chinese medical practice and discussions of autoimmunity. Autoimmune illnesses provide a case study to explore both Chinese medical practice and the use of the category autoimmunity in the United States."
0,"This article offers a theoretical and empirical analysis of legal endogeneity-a powerful process through which institutionalized organizational structures influence judicial conceptions of compliance with antidiscrimination law. It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965-99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions."
0,"Three forms of place attachment are tested to see if they predict local environmental concerns and feelings about development. Two forms of attachment are social, focused on objective roots and subjective identity. The other model focuses on appreciation for and contact with the natural environment. Analyses indicate that each model contributes to our understanding of attitudes about these issues even when controlling for environmental worldview, a strong predictor of these attitudes itself. These findings are also notable because the area from which the data is drawn is distinct from others typically examined in this literature for its geography and because it is undergoing and threatened by rapid and intensive land development."
0,"This study attempts to explain how and why African Americans are over-represented in some professional sports but under-represented in others. The researcher argues that the sports world has always and still remains segregated. In the past it was de jure segregation. Today, it is de facto segregation. The researcher believes that racial segregation is a result of forced action. Force can be defined three ways, through violence, through policies and laws, and through ideology.  Many black slaves were forced into horse racing because their masters required it of them. If they disobeyed him, they could be punished severely. During Jim Crow, many sport leagues passed laws outlawing blacks from their teams, forcing blacks to create separate Negro Leagues. Around 1950, many league owners lifted their sanctions allowing blacks to play, when they thought that it fit their needs. Many black youth have developed a false consciousness in which they believe that they are superior to whites in athletics, when there is no conclusive evidence to support this idea. The researcher plans to document the origins and changes in racial segregation throughout U.S. history, showing how blacks have been forced in and out of sports at the will of the white majority."
0,"Using the 2007 American Communities Survey, I examine the influence of employment and marital status on the likelihood an adult individual lives in the same home as her parent(s).  This living situation is termed coresidence.  Based on the life course perspective, I hypothesize that the unemployed, those not in the labor force, the single, separated, divorced, and widows have higher odds of coresiding.  Logistic regression models indicate that unemployment, being single, separated, divorced, and widowed are each associated with higher odds of coresiding, supporting my hypotheses.  I conclude that unstable employment and marital statuses in the life course increase the odds of coresiding.  Future research should examine other types of disruptions in the life course as they relate to coresidence as well as coresidence from a cross cultural perspective."
0,"This paper contains a preliminary effort to incorporate learning concepts into a field-theoretic approach in transnational studies. More specifically, it uses the field of international development to explore how fields can serve as sites for learning processes. Like many other transnational fields, international development is devoted to the achievement of normatively ambitious goals and purposes that are at the same time technically complex and politically fraught. The resulting risks and uncertainties of action, compounded by the absence of clear or reliably effective technologies to treat development problems or realize desired development goals, induce both competitive pressures and cooperative tendencies among field-level actors (including development organizations, experts, and activists and other norm entrepreneurs). But instead of seeing these pressures and tendencies as ‘games’ or as potential causes of erosion or deinstitutionalization of field-level structure, they are here analyzed as contributing to different kinds of learning processes. These processes, in turn, can lead to the extension or consolidation of existing field-level structures rather than their deinstitutionalization. At the same time, each learning process carries potential risks and hazards of their own; the possibility of paradox, rather than progress, is the only guarantee of field-level learning."
0,"A long-standing debate questions whether homemakers or working wives are happier. Drawing on cross-national data for 28 countries, this research uses multi-level models to provide fresh evidence on this controversy. All things considered, homemakers are slightly happier than wives who work fulltime, but they have no advantage over part-time workers. The work status gap in happiness persists even controlling for family life mediators. Cross-level interactions between work status and macro-level variables suggest that country characteristics-GDP, social spending, women's labor force participation, liberal gender ideology and public child care-ameliorate the disadvantage in happiness for full-time working wives compared to homemakers and part-time workers."
0,"While some scholars argue that ethnic identities influence educational achievement, few studies have examined whether education influences ethnic identity formation. This study uses a longitudinal survey to examine changes in ethnic identities from adolescence to adulthood among children of Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and how educational attainments, and other life experiences, relate to those changes. Contrary to assimilation frameworks suggesting that incorporation into mainstream higher education institutions should lead to greater identification as American or with U.S.-created racial/panethnic categories, such as Latino or black, these findings show that the most educated adult respondents identified with both their countries of origin and the United States, regardless of how they identified as adolescents. This study suggests that educational institutions are important contexts in which racial and ethnic identities are formed."
0,"Sociological research on aging has historically been dominated by two competing paradigms: role theories which focus on adjustment to role losses and maturation theories which link aging to youth by framing it as part of a progressive development process.  Most of this work has focused on the objective and subjective experiences of aging persons while relatively little of it has examined the perceptions of those with whom aging persons interact.  This paper is an attempt to close that loop by exploring the utility of these two theories for understanding the perceptions of other people towards the aging using a nationally representative data set.  After controlling for cohort specific differences in educational attainment, we find support for the maturational perspective."
0,"Using 2007 Chinese Spiritual Life Survey data, this study distinguishes three kinds of interpersonal trust--trust in kinship, trust in acquaintances and trust in strangers--and explores effects of religion on each kind of interpersonal trust. Analysis of the Generalized Ordered Logit model indicates that, individuals’ religious backgrounds have no significant effects on increasing the odds ratios of people to exert higher level of trust in kinship. The odds ratio of traditional Chinese religion believers to exhibit higher level of trust in acquaintances is significantly lower than atheists. However, all religions can enhance people’s trust in strangers. The religious belief of individuals exerts no significant influence on increasing the odds ratios of improving trust in kinship, while plays a significant positive role in increasing the odds ratio of enhancing trust in acquaintances and trust in strangers. Religious practice and social religious network have no significant influence on three kinds of interpersonal trust. Participating in secular activities can remarkably improve the level of trust in stranger."
0,"In the past twenty years since its publication, Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) general theory of crime, which states that juvenile delinquency and adult criminality is a result of low-self control, has become a standard in criminological theory. Past research has supported the now widely used and accepted Grasmick scale (1993) as a way to measure low self-control. There is also a growing body of literature showing a correlation between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and criminality. When comparing the Grasmick scale measure items and diagnostic criteria for ADHD, there are numerous similarities. This paper seeks to compare the use of the Grasmick Scale and diagnostic criteria for ADHD as proxies for predicting criminal behavior. Data used come from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) using structural equation modeling methodology. Latent concepts measured include parental ineffectiveness; lack of self-control, as measured via the Grasmick Scale and ADHD diagnostic criteria; and criminality.  Results from structural analysis show support for the Grasmick scale, as anticipated, in addition to weaker but still significant support for ADHD diagnostic criteria to predict criminality."
0,"The hairstyling industry in the UK is neither centralized nor concentrated. And the industry contains a remarkable diversity of work relations. Stylists (doing the same work  cutting, dying, styling) work as employees, self-employed, sub-contractors, trainees, employers and franchisees. They work from home, in dedicated work-sites or on the move; for small owner-practitioner businesses or corporate entities; in the formal or informal economies. This paper suggests that the diversity of work relations represent a set of solutions to structural problems that the labor of hairstyling presents. These problems are historically specific - constraints the labor process poses for the consistent reproduction and expansion of capital  the prerequisites for capitalist (re)investment. The three problems highlighted are: 1) maintaining demand given one-stop-clients; 2) predicting and coordinating skilled labor given endemically unpredictable workload; 3) controlling the labor process given high worker craft autonomy. This paper shows how particular work relations have proved useful solutions to the first two problems. However many of the same work relations have exacerbated the third problem. As workers continue to exert control over the labor process, with consequently little Taylorization, the capacity of large firms to reorganize the industry has been very limited, and so has concentration and centralization."
0,"Churches are places rooted into communities.  Evenso, little attention has been placed on taking an academic look at the way in which churches are spatially fixed and how those spatial practices construct/reflect theological and spiritual evidence for beliefs.  This project is a preliminary exploration of the spatial distribution of one community's congregations.    It reflects on where churches are located, how historical contexts of their location and identifies stories of transformation.  It is argued that the increasing dis-embodiedness of churches enables the move from placed based religion to the notion of seeker spirituality.  It raises the question of what it means for a place to be sacred.'"
0,"Exploring the links between militarized socialization and social inequality in Israel, the authors aim to examine both the pattern of political socialization, which extols the role of the combat soldier as the emblem of the ""good citizen,"" and the ways by which social agents themselves respond to this socialization. Although an all-encompassing phenomenon, the authors find militarized socialization is not equally ""distributed"" or ""received."" Rather, it reflects and reproduces the class and ethnic positions of its various recipients. Based on interviews with male soldiers in a wide range of military roles, the authors identify two types of responses to militarized socialization: (a) a dominant response of conformity and obedience, mainly expressed in the unquestioning acceptance of military service in a combat role, and (b) an ambivalent response, of simultaneous acceptance of and resistance to this ideal. In a more comparative vein, the authors argue that military service does not simply reproduce ethnic and class inequalities but rather, by molding the soldiers' conceptions of citizenship, is still a powerful mechanism of legitimizing a hegemonic militarized and class-differentiated social order."
0,"In the sociological literature on social mobility, the long-standing convention has been to assume that intergenerational reproduction takes one of two forms: a categorical form that has parents passing on a big-class position to their children or a gradational form that has parents passing on their socioeconomic standing. These approaches ignore in their own ways the important role that occupations play in transferring opportunities from one generation to the next. In new analyses of nationally representative data from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Japan, the authors show that (a) occupations are an important conduit for social reproduction, (b) the most extreme rigidities in the mobility regime are only revealed when analyses are carried out at the occupational level, and (c) much of what shows up as big-class reproduction in conventional mobility analyses is in fact occupational reproduction in disguise."
0,"This paper argues that although the EU does not fully determine the course taken by the Bergama environmental movement, it strongly influenced the development of the movement on three levels. First, it sets significant portions of issue agendas as addressed by the Bergama environmental lawyers. This happens through the EU environmental policy agenda and its influence on environmental policy development in Turkey. Second, it helps to shape the means and conditions of activism itself. EU has influenced the Bergama environmental movement strategies itself. Third, it serves as an external ally in terms of providing advices, political pressure in the movement efforts. It has pressured Turkey to improve its recrd on democracy and human rights, and in return, influenced the Turkish state behavior toward the BErgama protests."
0,"Past research recognizes that firms exploit regulatory variations to their advantage but depicts such regulatory arbitrage as a dyadic process between firms and regulators. We extend this account by including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22 U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW states. We conclude with a discussion of implications for the study of regulation, social movements, and organizations."
0,"Previous literature suggests a tenuous link between fathers' care of children and maternal employment and earnings. This study shows that the link is stronger when measures of caregiving capture fathers' increased responsibility for children. The analysis of time diary data from 6,572 married fathers and 7,376 married mothers with children under age 13 indicates that fathers (1) engage in more ""solo"" care of children when their wives are employed, (2) are more likely to do the kind of child care associated with responsibility for their children when their wives spend more time in the labor market, and (3) participate more in routine care when their wives contribute a greater share of the couple's earnings. In addition, the ""father care"" to ""mother care"" ratio rises when mothers contribute a greater share of household earnings."
0,"This study uses an identity theory framework to fill in gaps left by labeling theory in the explanation of criminal behavior resulting from one's identity. The authors examine the reciprocal relationship between the views of significant others, peers, and guards at the jail, and self-views for changes in the criminal identity, the drug user identity, and the worker identity using an incarcerated population. The findings suggest that identity theory provides a more detailed explanation of the processes by which the views of others can influence criminal behavior than labeling theory does. Identity theory allows for the explanation of different behavioral outcomes in response to the same label, which labeling theory does not provide."
0,"Migrant farmworker networks are vital components in their job seeking and underemployment minimization strategies. Yet, farmworker cultural, physical, and institutional isolation along with the itinerant and clandestine features of farmwork have become major obstacles in the development of robust lateral communitywide network ties that would otherwise favor reciprocity and resource sharing. Thus, contrary to the positive social capital assumption, we argue that the paucity and fragmented features of farmworkers' lateral ties have increased their vulnerability and locked them in exploitative relationships in a hostile social environment that makes impractical or impossible the formation of alternative ties. Our study is based on participant observation through a 6-week stay in three North Carolina farm labor camps. On-site evidence shows that the two larger groups of solitary male farmworkers and farmworking families break up into smaller groups, each group in pursuit of its own short-term goals. We conclude that, even though farmworker networks help them to find and ensure temporary jobs, their inability to use the networks to share resources is ultimately detrimental for participants' long-term socioeconomic prospects."
0,"Many students struggle to grasp the complex nature of inequality in society. Specifically, the systematic, covert, and endemic nature of institutional discrimination presents added challenges to educators because students’ folk level beliefs hinder their ability to understand its overarching effects. Often students possess emotional attachments to beliefs about the “American Dream” or lived experiences which cause them to either over identify with the data or resist its validity altogether. This article outlines the manner in which service learning can be utilized to overcome the aforementioned challenges and as an added benefit transform students into more civic minded individuals."
0,"Enjo Kosai, a social and cultural phenomenon that took place during the 1990s in Japan, was widespread among Japanese schoolgirls. Although it was broadly spread throughout the society, there is little information as to its concentration. At first, the activity of Enjo Kosai referred to schoolgirls dating older men for money. While the schoolgirls regarded this dating activity as a part-time “job,” for some, sexual intercourse became a part of the process, and with this addition, the perception of this activity began to resemble prostitution to some observers. For many, however, Enjo Kosai, as a social category, did not necessarily mean prostitution since sex was not necessarily inevitable or required in the social interaction between the involved persons; both possibilities are embedded in the one term, and the girls maintained the primary decision-making authority as to whether sex would be a part of the date.  While the news regarding Enjo Kosai is still seen on a daily basis, the media reports these cases as juvenile prostitution and it may lead people to assume that “Enjo Kosai” no longer exists in Japan. In this paper, I investigate how and why the phenomenon of Enjo Kosai was forgotten or was forced to be forgotten in Japanese society."
0,"Indigenous or Native knowledge reflects a long-term record of environmental functioning and change.  Yet, new claims are being made that climate change in the Arctic is erasing the relevance of indigenous knowledge in the circumpolar region. This research begins to explore how climate change and its resultant social, scientific and ecological processes alter Native Arctic knowledge and in so doing shape how adaptation to global warming occurs.  Climate-induced processes intersect in intimate ways.  Their interrelationships reflect the close connection between environment, knowledge, and everyday life for the Inuit.  These processes include melting permafrost that results in forced displacement and loss of cultural practices like hunting and fishing; expert knowledge of temperature change and projected impacts replacing local indigenous knowledge in environmental management; and shifting health risks raising questions about the most basic aspects of life like diet and travel.  By taking a combined methodological approach that includes interviews, life histories, film and geographic information systems mapping, I intend to create an understanding of how indigenous Arctic knowledge is shaped by unparalleled ecological change and Western science, and what needs to be done to save their cultural legacies as the earth warms."
0,"Employing ethnographic research methods, this paper provides a description and reflection on my fieldwork with a group of men working as day laborers at a casual work site in Brooklyn, New York City.  The participants are diverse across various characteristics, in particular nationality, race, and ethnicity.  This paper focuses on the interactions between the fieldworker and one of the different groups working at this intersection influenced by social positions of nationality, ethnicity, race, and gender.  As significant as are the persons and social action that are the focus of study in fieldwork, there are also the participants own interpretations of the fieldworker.  I consider the participants conceptions and thus, their social construction of the ethnographer and then go onto reflect how this experience informed and contributed to the interpretation of social meaning in the field.   The overall project attempts to advance our understanding of the incorporation of new immigrants into American society, by considering the factors shaping these processes and the effects on American culture.  And in this paper, the ethnographers work in interpreting meaning reflects the multiple realities and shifting identities of the various actors, including the researcher herself."
0,"With most adolescents now aspiring to graduate from college, assisting students in making the transition has become a key institutional function of high schools. Information about the application process is especially important for college entrance as admissions criteria are localized. Gaining access to information is one of the most important benefits of social capital. This study asks whether high schools with more connections to colleges are more successful in helping their students gain admission to college and, in particular, to selective four-year colleges. This study investigates the effects of having connections to colleges at a high school on students' college entry. This study also shows that actions taken by individual families bring about a contextual effect of a high school on the college selectivity that students attended in the same high school. These effects also mediate the relationship between school socioeconomic composition and enrollment in selective colleges."
0,"The U.S. woman suffragists routinely utilized two types of arguments in their demands for voting rights:  justice and reform arguments.  The former held that women should vote because they were mens equal and they should have political rights equal to those of men.  Reform arguments stated that women should have the ballot because women, given their unique womanly experiences and perspectives, would bring a unique contribution to politics and this would make society a more humane place.  Although social movement scholars increasingly study the framing work of movement activists, few systematic studies of framing processes exist.  In this work, we examine the circumstances that led the suffragists to amplify one or the other of these motivational frames.  We find that the suffragists were quite strategic in their choice of frames, targeting particular audiences and taking advantage of cultural opportunities for frame resonance.  But we find little evidence that their frame emphasis was driven by the collective identity of particular groups in the movement."
0,"As our understanding of disaster shifts from an event concentrated in time and space to a social occasion occurring across time and space, so too must our explanations of disaster shift from theories of the middle range to broader theoretical frameworks. We explore the world-system approach in an effort to understand the upper limits of theory for disaster and offer this approach as a better understanding of how long-term development shapes social change. Utilizing media reports of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami from the United States to India, Indonesia and Thailand over a one-year period, we find perceptions of aid vary by economic zones and nation-states in the contemporary world system."
0,We examine the influence of community context on change over time in households' use of non-wood fuels. Our theoretical framework builds on sociological concepts in order to study energy consumption at the micro-level. The framework emphasizes the importance of nonfamily organizations and services in the local community as determinants of the transition from use of fuelwood to use of alternative fuels. We use multilevel longitudinal data on household fuel choice and community context from rural Nepal to provide empirical tests of our theoretical model. Results reveal that increased exposure to nonfamily organizations in the local community increases the use of alternative fuels. The findings illustrate key features of human impacts on the local environment and motivate greater incorporation of social organization into research on environmental change. 
0,"From an identity theory perspective, reflected appraisals from others are relevant for social behavior, because behavior is motivated by the desire to achieve congruence between reflected appraisals and the self-view for a particular identity. This study extends prior identity theory work from the laboratory setting by examining identity processes with respect to the criminal identity in the unique ""natural"" setting of a total institution. The findings build on prior work which finds that reflected appraisals do have an influence on identities and behavior by demonstrating that the relationship one has to the source of reflected appraisals is important for the way in which reflected appraisals influence the criminal self-view for an incarcerated population."
0,"A recent wave of popular and scholarly discourse has hailed the arrival of the Web 2.0, marking a new generation of Internet users who share and collaborate on popular social networking sites such as MySpace and user-generated communities such as YouTube and Wikipedia. Social and cultural critics have attempted to take stock of the implications of these various technological changes with specific emphasis on the state of knowledge in contemporary society. This article aims to theoretically examine knowledge in the context of new media technologies with particular attention paid to the notion of ""reflexivity."" Focusing on the work of Scott Lash, whose theory of reflexivity radically differs from various other interpretations, I suggest that knowledge, in its modern formulation-as reasoned, stable, and linear-must be rethought for the information age, critiquing some of the predominant scholarly and popular media criticisms that suggests media to be mere enhancements of human forms of communication, knowledge, and sense-making. I conclude by considering some of the ontological dimensions of the transformations in the dynamics of knowledge in new media technologies."
0,"This paper elaborates a broker-centered theory of transnational organizational fields.  Like nation-bound organizational fields, transnational organizational fields are systems of actors, actions, and relations whose participants take one another into account as they carry out interrelated activities (McAdam and Scott 2002).  However, unlike nation-bound fields, transnational organizational fields are embedded within two or more nationally organized regulatory regimes (which include both state and professional rational-legal apparatuses) and two or more cultural systems (broadly conceived as consisting of codes of manners, language, norms of behavior, and systems of belief).  Given these differences, the question is how are organizational fields formed and sustained across borders?  I argue that systemic brokers, essentially intermediaries that span boundaries, are central to the construction and cohesion of transnational organizational fields.  Systemic brokers are field makers: they create cross-border relational and cognitive connections that draw organizations and professionals together into cooperative arenas of common purpose.  Systemic brokers, however, must continuously adjust these connections because nation-states exert strong counter-forces that pull transnational ties apart."
0,"Conventional wisdom holds that friends protect against depression through the social support they provide; however, depression likely has a role in structuring friendship networks. In particular, we investigate friend selection mechanisms responsible for similarity in depression among friends (i.e., homophily). Preference is one explanation, yet several correlates of depression make homophilous selection among depressed individuals unlikely. We propose two alternative mechanisms-avoidance and withdrawal-that can produce depression homophily in the absence of preference. These alternative mechanisms create homophily indirectly by limiting friendship partners available to depressed individuals. We test the preference, avoidance, and withdrawal mechanisms using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a dynamic network model. Results provide support for the withdrawal mechanism. These findings help explain how depression affects friend selection and have broader implications for understanding selection mechanisms responsible for network patterns such as homophily."
0,"Adolescent employment is typically framed as having either positive or negative effects. Yet cutting edge research yields apparently contradictory results; work lowers delinquency but also increases school dropout. Both opportunity cost and life course development theories could explain these results. This study investigates effects of employment on fertility among adolescent women, which pits life course development against opportunity cost theory. Using 2006 and 2007 American Community Surveys, individual instrumental variable and state-level difference-in-difference models (following the same cohort over time) control for self-selection and find a positive effect of employment on adolescent fertility. National Vital Statistics birth data confirm state-level results. Results for fertility (and some evidence for other early transitions) indicate that youth employment speeds the transition to adulthood, supporting life course theory. Findings suggest adolescent employment should be reconceived as promoting adult rather than positive or negative behavior. "
0,"A spatial analysis of data for French departements assembled in the 1830s by Andre-Michel Guerry and Adolphe d'Angeville examines the impacts of modernization and resistance to governmental ""Frenchification"" policies on measures of violence and its direction. In the context of Unnithan et al.'s integrated model of suicide and homicide, high suicide rates in the northern core and a predilection for violence against others in the southern periphery may be consistently interpreted in terms of theories of the civilizing process and internal colonialism. Alternative explanations of southern violence in 19th-century France are explored and rejected, and additional theoretical applications are suggested."
0,"Over one third of all U. S. births are to unmarried women, many cohabiting with their baby's father. While nonmarital childbearing is concentrated among the less educated, in recent decades, its prevalence has increased among those with a high school degree or some college education. This article explores whether cohabitors with some postsecondary schooling challenge normative views regarding marriage as a prerequisite for childbearing. Data are from twenty-four in-depth interviews with childless cohabitors. The majority of respondents intending to have children consider marriage a necessary prerequisite; adherence to this particular sequence is firmest for those with strong aspirations for middle-class status and professional careers. Nonetheless, a considerable share does not view marriage as an imperative, either for parenting or as an end in itself."
0,"This analysis uses data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses to explore individual and contextual factors that influence U.S.-born Hispanic adults to maintain Spanish alongside English.  Cuban of Puerto Rican ancestry, living with a Spanish-dominant person, having children in ones household, and working in a service- or health-related job all increase the odds of bilingualism.  Contextual incentives  growth in a states Hispanic population, bilinguals status, and Hispanics political influence  also positively influence the odds of bilingualism. By showing a positive relationship between upward mobility, political participation, and bilingualism, my findings suggest that it is possible for Hispanics in the U.S. to maintain selected characteristics of their origin culture while becoming American."
0,"The paper uses data from 70 in-depth interviews with activists involved in anti-water privatization movements in Stockton, CA, USA and Vancouver, BC, Canada to examine the role of context-dependent meanings of water in shaping political mobilization around environmental resources. Drawing on theories of environmental sociology and social movements, the paper explains how the nature of water as a geographically-bound resource that is deeply imbued with cultural, historical and social meaning is intricately tied to the mobilization of these movements. Through a social constructionist approach of environmental resources, I demonstrate that social movements – particularly those that seek to protect the commons – are shaped by more than structural mechanisms such as political institutions and networks, and are also influenced by the social and cultural experiences of movement actors, including their emotional and visceral attachments to place. Investigating social-psychological and situated perceptions of water is important for explaining pre-mobilization attitudes and values that influence people’s decisions to participate in broader environmental movements and helps clarify why people mobilize to protect water resources as part of the commons."
0,"After becoming consistently more egalitarian for more than two decades, gender role attitudes in the General Social Survey have changed little since the mid-1990s. This plateau mirrors other gender trends, suggesting a fundamental alteration in the momentum toward gender equality. While cohort replacement can explain about half of the increasing egalitarianism between 1974 and 1994, the changes since the mid-1990s are not well accounted for by cohort differences. Nor is the post-1994 stagnation explained by structural or broad ideological changes in American society. The recent lack of change in gender attitudes is more likely the consequence of the rise of a new cultural frame, an ""egalitarian essentialism"" that blends aspects of feminist equality and traditional motherhood roles."
0,"A large body of previous research documents a link between higher levels of educational attainment and more efficacious health behaviors and improved health outcomes. However, the majority of existing research into education and health approaches the problem at the individual level, failing to take into account the potentially independent influence exerted by the educational attainment of ones spouse. In this paper, pooled cross-sectional data from the National Health Interview Survey are utilized to assess whether ones own health shares an association with the education of his/her partner independently of his/her own education. A series of binary logistic regression equations regressing self rated health upon ones own and ones spouses education are estimated separately by gender. The results indicate that spousal education does indeed share association with ones own health independently of ones own education and that the magnitude of the observed association is comparable for both males and females. The results suggest that when it comes to health, education may be a household  rather than solely an individual  resource. The inclusion of spousal SES characteristics in models predicting health outcomes will allow researchers to better understand how stratification processes play-out within the context of the family to influence health outcomes."
0,"A new approach to the statistical estimation of age-period-cohort (APC) accounting models, called the intrinsic estimator (IE), recently has been developed. This article (1) further describes the IE algebraically, geometrically, and verbally, (2) reviews properties of the IE as a statistical estimator, (3) provides model validation evidence for the IE both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4) relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability, hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a criticism that often has been lodged at general-purpose methods of APC analysis, and (5) introduces computer software for application of the IE that interested users can readily access. The authors conclude that the IE holds the potential for applications not only to APC analysis but also to similar problems of structural underidentification in sociology."
0,"The research on environmental concerns in the last twenty years has looked at age groups involvement, interest, and concerns; and concluded that the older adult are not focused on environmental concerns. The best predictor of concern for environmental issues were younger age, higher education, and politically liberal. 186 older adults were surveyed to determine their level of environmental concern. Participants were asked to express their level of interest in twelve areas: health care, grandpa renting, home safety, racial/ethnic issues, nutrition, caregiving, political issues, art, exercise/movement, recycling, clean air, and clean water. The data returned surprising results with the highest concern and interest in clean air and clean water. No significant variation in interest was found based on age groupings, living environment, or location of residence. This sample population shows a change in the older adults view of environmental issues and want for education on these issues. This reflects a difference from previous research."
0,"Using data from the 2006 Family Module of the East Asian Social Survey, we use regression-based methods to decompose the sex gap in hourly wages in Japan South Korea and Taiwan We find that Taiwan has the smallest sex gap in wages and is also distinctive in that employed women have more education than men on average Japan is distinctive in the high proportion of women consigned to non-regular (temporary often part-time) jobs and this factor explains much more of the gap in Japan than elsewhere Korea is distinctive in having an extremely high proportion of men who are college graduates therefore in Korea gender differences in education and occupational placement explain more of the gap than elsewhere Despite many historical similarities between these societies our analysis points out the heterogeneity within industrialized East Asia when it comes to gender inequality "
0,"While the political debate over immigration policy rages on, what is often lost in the discussion is that the treatment of undocumented immigrants in the United States is directly linked to human rights.  As the apprehension, detention, and deportation of undocumented immigrants in the United States becomes more pervasive and the mechanisms used to police the undocumented become more expansive, it is imperative to evaluate how the treatment of non-citizens within the United States’ borders impacts its stature on issues such as human rights.  To do this, we must first examine the meaning of citizenship in modern democratic societies, and then apply these notions of citizenship in order to help us better understand how the United States’ immigration policies fall short.  Drawing on the work of Durkheim and Weber, this paper demonstrates that while these classical theorists – through their unique theoretical approaches – saw citizenship as a tool that could unite diverse members of a society, citizenship in the contemporary United States is used as an apparatus of exclusion and exploitation, which has significant deleterious implications for the social and civil fabric of the United States.  Based on these findings, this paper contends that the United States should seek a more inclusive definition of citizenship so that its immigration policies will better reflect its ideals."
0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of having a child diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on the social and emotional well-being of fathers. While mothers have been carefully scrutinized in ADHD-related literature, fathers have been largely excluded from research designs developed to explore the effects of raising a child with ADHD. Prior research has been primarily based on small, clinically referred and homogenous samples, often without comparisons or controls. This research utilizes a nationally representative sample from the 2001 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to determine differences between fathers of children with ADHD and control fathers and to analyze how the ADHD status of the child, problematic behavior, use of medication, and paternal social support influences fathers' sense of well-being. This research is also designed to determine whether there are child and family contexts in which the effect of ADHD status on paternal well-being is moderated. Contrary to previous findings about the emotional and social burden associated with raising an ADHD child, few differences between fathers were found."
0,"Previous research has yielded important understandings of how sexual minorities adjust to living in a heteronormative culture, but scholarly critiques of assimilation and Merton's research on adaptations to deviance suggest value in examining whether there are distinct types of adaptation. Applying Merton's definition of adaptations in anomic environments suggests that different patterns can be defined depending on the importance placed on assimilation and on sexual expression. Using the 1997 Urban Men's Health Study data (n=2,585), four different adaptation patterns are defined: MSM conformist, MSM innovator, MSM nonconformist, and MSM uninvolved. To establish criterion validity, expected correlates of membership in each group are then examined. The distinct groups, each representing from 20 percent to 30 percent of the sample, largely conformed to expectations on measures of sexual self-identification, involvement in gay culture, intimacy and sexual exploration, health, and income. Scholarly and policy implications of the adaptation typology are considered."
0,"An abiding dilemma of participant observation has been how to gain access to subjects’ “inner lives” while maintaining analytic detachment. This article provides a new perspective on this problem, drawing inspiration from the Marquis de Custine’s Russia in 1839, still celebrated for the accuracy of its predictions. Yet Custine was a nineteenth century travel writer whose observational practice was, by modern standards, far from exemplary. His perspicacity therefore presents a puzzle. Here I argue that Custine’s use of his emotions is the key to understanding his percipience. Custine documents a process of “emotional contagion,” through which his thoughts and behavior were influenced by the emotions of those around him. Using the Custine case, I argue that sociologists can harness the potential of emotional contagion by adapting the psychoanalytic use of countertransference, which constitutes a specialized means of working with this ubiquitous feature of human interaction."
0,"This article argues that existing studies on cultural capital and educational success fail to distinguish the different channels through which cultural capital promotes educational success. Following Bourdieu, the article proposes that for cultural capital to promote educational success three conditions must hold: (1. parents must possess cultural capital, (2. they must transfer their cultural capital to children, and (3. children must absorb cultural capital and convert it into educational success. This research develops an empirical model that analyzes the significance of the three effects with respect to Danish children choice of secondary education. Denmark is well-suited for this study because access to secondary education is particularly meritocratic. The empirical analysis shows that all three channels through which cultural capital affects educational success are important."
0,"Requiring or coercing individuals into alcohol and other substance abuse (AOD) treatment has become a widely accepted practice.  But the use of what some have come to call therapeutic jurisprudence has sparked an ongoing debate centered on the adequacy of legal protections and due process rights for clients, the impact of requiring treatment on clients, the efficacy of required treatment, and finding ways to get more clients into treatment voluntarily.  Required treatment is most often used in the workplace and the criminal justice system.  The research on required treatment for employee populations generally shows reduced psychiatric, medical, and legal consequences, and increased productivity in the workplace comparable to volunteer referrals.  Beginning in the 1980s, many states have created what is most frequently called drug courts.  The research generally shows that participants get into treatment earlier, program costs are lower than standard criminal justice system processing, and drug use and criminal behavior are generally reduced.  While most of the research shows that required treatment for AOD abuse can be effective, most professionals would agree that whenever possible, the best policy is for individuals to feel they have voluntarily sought and participated in treatment.  In situations where individuals are coerced or required to participate in treatment, they should have some choices in the type of treatment and have appropriate legal and ethical safeguards.  The challenge is to finds ways to increase individuals motivation for entering and remaining in treatment and to find ways to make treatment more attractive and successful to individuals with a wide variety of AOD abusing problems."

Less is known about perspectives scientists develop on their variously rewarded and recognized careers.  This study examines peoples subjective appraisals of attainment in academic science based on a sample of interviews with physicists who discussed their perspectives on success, including the most salient self-doubts they experience in their roles.  The sample is divided into achievement echelons to see how self-doubts vary among those throughout the strata of science."
0,"Conditions of work in Europe are changing, with firms and the welfare state expecting workers to have a greater willingness to be geographically mobile.  We examine the degree to which individuals are responding by actually becoming mobile for their jobs.  Our paper compares the rates of job-related spatial mobility along multiple dimensions; for example relocation, long-distance commuting, overnight business travel, and establishing a second residence.  We also ask who is spatially mobile, in what ways, and for what reasons, using a representative sample in six European countries: Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, and Switzerland.  Data are collected from April to July 2007 in all six countries by the European Commissions Job Mobilities and Family Lives in Europe Project, and (pending acceptance) will be publicly presented for the first time."
0,"This article contributes to the growing literature on the synergic production of civil society in newly democratized countries. State sponsorship can be effective when clientelism, as a form of social dominance, continues to frustrate purposive organization from below. Three elements are necessary for this scenario. First, a group of reform-minded officials must be able to pursue an independent agenda that deviates from local elites. Second, reformers have to create new institutional avenues to channel resources downward by bypassing local politicians. Lastly, civil society organizations must be capable of effectively responding to the initiatives from above. I use Taiwans community movement to understand the logic and consequences of sponsoring civil society. State endorsement is critical to legitimatize community organizations presence in local politics. With a detailed analysis of a local case, the Qiaodou community movement, I argue that state sponsorship is critical for the growth of civil society organizations. Sponsored movement activism maintains its political independence by leveraging the incoherence in bureaucratic division of labor, and its professional expertise offers an advantageous bargaining position when facing officials."
0,"Researchers specializing in organizations and labor markets have paid insufficient attention to the effects that foreign ownership of a firm and its orientation towards export production may have on the wages it pays to its workers. Using information from a nationally-representative sample of manufacturing firms in Mexico, a paradigmatic case of a developing country that is highly integrated into world markets, we find that foreign-owned and export-oriented firms pay considerably more than nationally-owned firms engaged in the production of goods for sale in the domestic market. Second, beyond paying higher wages to their workers, foreign-owned firms also raise the wages paid by domestic firms operating in the same regional labor markets. The wage premium in foreign and export-oriented firms cannot be explained by their size, industry, geographical location, productivity, use of advanced technology, or the sociodemographic composition of their workforce. We find evidence that wages in foreign-owned companies in Mexico are dependent on the country of origin of the capital investment. A greater difference between the industry-specific wages paid in the country of ownership and Mexico is associated with a higher wage premium in Mexican affiliates. Future work should strive to link information from foreign-owned affiliates with their parent companies abroad. "
0,"School aggression constitutes an ongoing, serious problem in schools. Unlike much previous research, we envision aggression as a relational, social process, embedded in social networks that shape its development.  We examine data on aggression, or bullying, gathered over time from a well-to-do New York school.  We find that aggression and harassment involve many school-aged students, even at the very best schools. Over half the student body is involved in one way or another.  Aggression is unrelated to a host of demographic and family background factors—factors which are normally strong predictors of outcomes. Aggression is one way that youth sort out status hierarchies, and some view it as a means to gain or maintain their status.  According to our results, aggression and victimization rates escalate as students increased in peer status, that is, until they approach the very top of the pyramid. At that point, they rise above the fray, and aggression and victimization rates begin to plummet. Youth are aggressive toward their status rivals, and the majority of aggression occurs within, rather than across, groups like gender, race, and grade in school. Finally, aggressive acts also are shaped by the pattern of dating ties in the school.  The more partners an individual has dated, the more prone is he or she to become a victim of aggression. These harmful behaviors may be intended to increase the status of the aggressor and at the same time reduce the likelihood that a possible competitor threatens the viability of a potential romance."
0,"Aside from the literature on inter-racial and cross-sex relationships, few studies have examined the determinants of relationships that cross social boundaries. The authors contribute to this literature by considering the social boundary between the religious and the non-religious. Surveys of U.S. adults provide evidence of popular aversion toward the non-religious, but this analysis of the Baylor Religion Survey (2005) shows that the majority of religious Americans report a friendship with someone who is not religious at all. The authors find that such boundary-crossing relationships are largely structured by homophily, opportunities for intergroup contact, and religious barriers to intergroup contact. These findings reveal that some religiously themed conflicts that are common among cultural elites may not be particularly salient in the realm of daily social life."
0,"The emergence, proliferation, and institutionalization of the global human rights regime have received much scholarly attention over the years.  Among the many concerns of human rights scholars are the varied impacts of this global regime on the lives of everyday citizens.  Recently, some have sought to measure the effects of international human rights treaties and whether or not states that ratify them are more compliant with human rights principles.  Interestingly, many have found that formal ratification does not improve state compliance, while others contend that it actually leads to greater repression in some cases.  We reassess these provocative findings, focusing on a seminal study by Hafner-Burton and Tsutsui (2005), and find that there are several methodological shortcomings.  After correcting for these shortcomings and replicating their study we find strong evidence for the opposite effect – that human rights treaty ratification improves respect for human rights and is associated with lower levels of state repression."
0,"Women generally initiate, lead, and comprise the rank-and-file of environmental justice activism. However, there is little research on why there are comparatively so few men involved in these movements. Using the environmental justice movement in the Central Appalachian coalfields as a case study, we examine the ways that environmental justice activism is gendered, with a focus on how women’s and men’s collective identities both shape and constrain their involvement in gendered ways. Our analysis relies on 20 in-depth interviews with women and men grassroots activists working for environmental justice in the coalfields of Appalachia. We find that women draw on their collective identities as “mothers” and “Appalachians” as resources for the movement and to justify their activism, whereas men speak of their activism from a more individuated perspective, focusing on personal experiences of injustice. Additionally, we argue that the hegemonic masculinity of the region, which is tied to the coal industry, constrains coalfield men’s involvement in the movement. We explore the implications of these gendered differences for the future of the environmental justice movement in the coalfields."
0,"Using a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we examine associations among social integration (network size), network cohesion (alter-density), perceptions of social relationships (e.g., social support) and adolescent depressive symptoms. We find that adolescents with either too large or too small a network have higher levels of depressive symptoms. Among girls, however, the ill effects of over-integration only occur at low levels of network cohesion. For boys, in contrast, the ill effects of over-integration only occur at high levels of network cohesion. Large social networks tend not to compromise positive perceptions of friend support or belonging; whereas, small networks are associated with low perceptions of friend support and belonging. Hence, perceptions of social relationships mediate the ill effects of under-integration, but not over-integration, on depressive symptoms."
0,"Recent research on change in organizations has called special attention to the institutional logic that underlies organizational structure and the potential for those logics to come in to conflict. According to the work of the researchers like Haveman and Rao (2006), these issues are specially relevant to hybrid organizations that see to combine within them two alternative sets of organizing principles. This study attempts to shed light on these issues by examining change in the compensation practices of Japanese business organizations in recent years. In the late 1990s, most Japanese companies either replaced or supplemented their traditional age-based systems of compensation with new performance-based pay systems. In practice, Japanese companies have found performance-based payment systems much more difficult to introduce than they anticipated because the old pay system and the new pay system rely on fundamentally, contradictory institutional logics. As problems with the new system have accumulated, both nation wide business organizations and individual companies have promoted hybrid compensation systems that seek to escape this contradiction. Today, however, these efforts have served only to complicate the choices available to Japanese organizations but have not succeeded in restoring to Japanese workplaces the harmony for which they are known in West."
0,"Male-oriented serious leisure subcultures provide many men in the U.S. with sites for construction and enactment of masculine identities. This paper describes the narrative themes and identity stories associated with the serious leisure subcultures of skydiving and gun collecting. While masculine social worlds like these have been described by many scholars as providing oases or escape hatches from the gender politics of the broader society, we find that members of these two groups perceive themselves as stigmatized and that they respond in various collective ways to manage the stigma associated with their subcultural activities and identities. We examine both out-group and in-group stigma management strategies invoked by members of these subcultures in order to more clearly understand the processes through which masculinity is created and sustained in these, and similar, male-oriented serious leisure social worlds."
0,"Using the recent spate of so-called Defense of Marriage (DOMA) referenda as a point of analysis, the author argues that direct democracy presents the potential for intensifying the nature of interparty competition at the state level. Given a particular configuration of circumstances-namely where a salient electoral issue cross-cuts already existing party cleavages-ballot referenda can become tools by which political parties ""poach"" members of an opposing coalition. Using data at the county level, the author finds evidence that DOMA ballot referenda do not simply mobilize conservative Protestant voters; they also ( potentially) reorient the partisan loyalties of two core Democratic constituencies: African Americans and Hispanics. However, as the electoral system is dynamic, the effectiveness of referenda as mechanisms of partisan competition changes with succeeding election cycles and may even lead to unintended effects. Notably, late-cycle DOMA elections ( those occurring in 2005 and 2006) provide evidence both for increasingly effective mobilization within the gay and lesbian community and, more surprisingly, to increasing opposition to antigay marriage measures on the part of Main-line Protestant and Catholic voters. The author discusses the implications of these findings for our understanding of the gay marriage debate specifically and for the dynamics of the American party system more generally."
0,"This article explores how the efficiency of Internet search is changing the way Americans find romantic partners. We use a new data source, the How Couples Meet and Stay Together survey. Results show that for 60 years, family and grade school have been steadily declining in their influence over the dating market. In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has partly displaced not only family and school, but also neighborhood, friends, and the workplace as venues for meeting partners. The Internet increasingly allows Americans to meet and form relationships with perfect strangers, that is, people with whom they had no previous social tie. Individuals who face a thin market for potential partners, such as gays, lesbians, and middle-aged heterosexuals, are especially likely to meet partners online. One result of the increasing importance of the Internet in meeting partners is that adults with Internet access at home are substantially more likely to have partners, even after controlling for other factors. Partnership rate has increased during the Internet era (consistent with Internet efficiency of search) for same-sex couples, but the heterosexual partnership rate has been flat."
0,"In the United States, rhetoric in support of the Iraq War often focuses on discourses of patriotism and supporting the troops. These discourses hold enormous sway over the American public because of the discursive legacies of the Vietnam War and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In response, members of the peace movement who are veterans, soldiers, and military families stress their military identities during activism. These individuals have organized as an important branch of the U.S. antiwar movement that challenges the pro-war framing of patriotism and troop support by strategically deploying ""oppositional identities."" The oppositional identity strategy involves highlighting the activism of individuals who many would assume would be part of the movement's opposition. In an effort to assert credibility and support their frames, activists assert this novel and seemingly contradictory identity. through organizational affiliation, rhetoric, clothing, mannerisms, and symbols."
0,"This paper provides new estimates of changing patterns of serial cohabitation, using data from the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. Serial cohabitation is defined as having multiple premarital cohabiting relationships. Analyses indicate that rates of serial cohabitation increased by nearly 40 percent over the late 1990s and early 2000s, and rates were especially high among young adults and recent marriage cohorts. A large majority of women - 75 percent - nevertheless lived only with men they eventually married. Although rates of serial cohabitation are higher among never-married women than ever-married women, there is little indication that single women - even older single women - have embraced serial cohabitation as an alternative to marriage or even as an intensive kind of dating. The results show that serial cohabitation is heavily concentrated among disadvantaged populations (e.g., women who grew up in single parent families). Early sexual activity and teen childbearing are especially important ""risk"" factors for serial cohabitation in the never-married population. There is little evidence, however, that recent shifts in the sociodemographic risk profile of the US population have been responsible for observed increases in single-instance or serial cohabitation. Increases in serial cohabitation have been broadly experienced across population groups in America. "
0,"Based on panel data for three age cohorts of children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine how early home environment contributes to black-white achievement gaps at different developmental stages and the extent to which early gaps contribute to later racial achievement gaps. We find large black-white test score differences among children of all ages even before children start formal schooling. Except for the oldest cohort, the gaps for all tests widened when children's cognitive skills were assessed six years later. Racial achievement gaps in applied problem scores by grade three and letter-word scores by grade six, can be accounted for by child's characteristics, family socioeconomic background, and mother's cognitive skills. However, these covariates explain an increasingly smaller proportion of the black-white achievement gap as children advance to higher grades. Gaps in early cognitive skills are highly predictive of gaps at later ages, setting off a trajectory of cumulative disadvantage for black children over time. Our results underscore the key role of early home environment and the intergenerational roots of the persistent black-white achievement gap. "
0,"Previous research examining the intergenerational transmission of gender ideology focuses generally on the influence of mothers' beliefs. This article extends the understanding of gender ideology construction and transmission in two important ways. Utilizing data from the child sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (N=206), we examine the construction of adolescent gender ideology via mothers' and fathers' gender beliefs. Further, we consider the interaction between maternal and paternal ideologies as they influence adolescent ideology. Findings suggest that paternal ideology plays a strong role in adolescent ideology formation, both directly and as a moderator of maternal influence."
0,"Statistically, the rate of second generation Asian-Americans embracing Christianity has significantly increased.  In this paper, a case study at an undergraduate public college is used in order to introduce a wide variety of social forces that might be responsible for this phenomena.  The conclusion drawn is that second generation Asian-Americans posess a transformed minority identity which is shaped by varying forces of racial, religious, and other social factors.  Final thoughts and suggestions for further research close the paper."
0,"Organizations are technologies of coordination.  They coordinate the activities of heterogeneous actors toward achieving some goal or moving toward some mission.  Coordinating heterogeneity presents organizations with a set of problems that must be overcome if the organization is to be effective.  However, the activity also presents leaders with opportunities to innovate as they can take advantage of competing value claims of actors within their purview.  In this paper, I analyze the case of a social entrepreneurial organization, the mission of which is to provide technology consulting services to the local nonprofit sector.  Social entrepreneurial organizations combine values drawn from potentially competing sources, as reflected by their sources of revenue.  In order to be effective as organizations, social entrepreneurships must find creative ways of internalizing competing values, like efficiency and altruism, and creatively exploiting the tension between their corresponding values.  Maintaining a creative tension among these competing values is at the heart of innovation (Girard and Stark 2002).  This is a problem many, if not all, organizations face, but one that is particularly pronounced among social entrepreneurial organizations, in which actors must reconcile the double bottom line of social and economic returns (Dart 2004b)."
0,"What role does the Internet play in mobilizing participants in days of action/?  Although most research has focused on the way that computer mediated communication is changing transnational collective action, it is unclear how social movement reliance on this new form of communication is modifying protest within nation-states.  This paper analyzes how participants in a national day of action in the United States mobilized, focusing on the role of the Internet. We find that a very high percentage of participants in all cities heard about the day of action through e-mail lists or Websites.  Those who mobilized through the Internet, however, were very different from those who mobilized through personal and organizational ties.  In particular, the participants who heard about the event through the Internet were much more likely to come to the event alone than those who heard about it through their social networks.  The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings to understanding collective action more broadly."
0,"The concept, policies, and application of affirmative action continue to engage multiethnic countries around the world in debate. This paper compares the origins, evolution, and outcomes of affirmative action policies in the U.S. with those in India, looking specifically at rationales for affirmative action. Applying Tummalas (1999) four key justifications of Compensatory Justice, Distributive Justice, Social Utility, and Responsiveness to both American and Indian affirmative action programs, I assert that an overall difference in justifications has led to divergent outcomes in these countries. Specifically, I find that Indias dependence on equality principles as the foundation for affirmative action has led to increasing social equality through these programs there, while equality has not been achieved and should not be expected in the U.S. where the primary justification for affirmative action rests on diversity."
0,"This paper examines the nature and determinants of dog owners attitudes toward, treatment of, and interactions with, animals.  Based on 28 in-depth interviews with dog owners from a Midwestern county, I demonstrate that pets are an important part of many peoples lives, often providing companionship, entertainment, and meaningful interactions; however, there are notable, distinct variations in how people relate to them.  I find that pet owners typically exhibit one of three different orientations toward pets: dominionist, humanist, and protectionist.  Dominionist pet owners have relatively low regard for their pets, valuing them primarily for the uses they provide, such as protection.  Humanists, who elevate their pets to the status of surrogate humans, value their pets primarily for the affective benefits they enjoy from their close emotional attachments.  Protectionists have high regard for both pets and animals more generally.  They view pets as valuable companions and as creatures with their own interests.  I argue that these distinct orientations toward animals are informed by multiple, competing cultural logics as well as personal experiences, demographic characteristics, and family structure."
0,"One of the most prominent explanations for Minority underachievement in the labor market is what has been termed the spatial mismatch hypothesis. The original formulation of the hypothesis by John Kain focused on the effects of racially Segregated housing on workers' labor market outcomes assuming race-neutral employers. This paper reports the results of a case study designed to test Kain's original conception of this important hypothesis within the context of a longitudinal analysis of a relocating food processing plant. Because the workers in this study did not choose the firm's new location, the relocation can be treated as an exogenous, demand-side shock to the local labor market. This natural experiment design solves the major problem of extant approaches to the theory, i.e., the selective migration of minorities to areas with high concentrations of jobs. The study design also eliminates the confounding factor of non-race-neutral employers using space as a means to discriminate against minorities since the circumstances of this move make us confident that the firm is not moving for racial motives. We find support in favor of Kain's version of the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Despite the firm's best intentions and work to minimize the impact of the spatial disruption caused by the relocation, the racial segregation of the area's housing market hampered minorities' adjustments to the relocation. Consistent with Kain's formulation, spatially discriminating employers are not needed to produce race differences in job accessibility; racially segregated housing markets alone can generate such outcomes.

0,"Over the past 40 years, womens unpaid work time has declined whereas mens has increased. Yet, managing household labor continues to be womens responsibility and may be associated with increased multitasking. Additionally, because men do not conceptualize household labor as their real work, they are not likely to take the initiative for unpaid work. If women multitask to a greater extent than men and if they retain responsibility for coordinating and supervising unpaid work, overlooking these differences in the qualitative nature of time may bias the apparent trend towards convergence in womens and mens unpaid work investments. This analyses uses chronological activity records from U.S. time diary studies conducted in 1975 and 1998 to examine whether trends in married mothers and married fathers unpaid work look any different with the addition of time in simultaneous housework, child care or shopping; and whether fathers appear to be assuming more responsibility for unpaid work than they have historically. Preliminary analyses indicate that rather than a widespread disinvestment in unpaid work, married mothers have shed time only in primary housework activities whereas time in primary child care and shopping and all secondary household labor has increased. Married fathers time increased in all primary and secondary unpaid work activities over the same period, indicating greater involvement in core household labor. Additionally, married fathers increases are concentrated in solo time suggesting fathers are taking more responsibility for household labor. Nonetheless, married mothers continue to do 1.7 times as much primary and 2.6 times as much secondary unpaid work as compared to fathers."
0,"This article examines how suicides influence suicide risks of others within two interaction domains: the family and the workplace. A distinction is made between dyad-based social-interaction effects and degree-based exposure effects. A unique database including till individuals who ever lived in Stockholm during the 1990s is analyzed. For about 5.6 years on average, 1.2 million individuals are observed, and 1, 116 of them commit suicide. Controlling for other risk factors, men exposed to a suicide in the family (at work) are 8.3 (3.5) times more likely to commit suicide than non-exposed men. The social-interaction effect thus is larger within the family domain; yet work-domain exposure is more important for the suicide rate because individuals are more often exposed to suicides of coworkers than family members."
0,"This study reports a cross-cultural test of Social Learning Theory using direct measures of social learning constructs and focusing on the causal structure implied by the theory. Overall, the results strongly confirm the main thrust of the theory. Prior criminal reinforcement and current crime-favorable definitions are highly related in all three contexts and both strongly predict self-projections of criminal behavior. In addition, effects of prior reinforcement on projected misconduct appear to be both direct and indirect (through crime-favorable definitions). Yet, the findings also indicate that the processes underlying direct effects of reinforcement on criminal probabilities may need to be explicated further. Moreover, some types of definitions may be more influential than other types. Finally, parts of the reinforcement process may be affected by socio-cultural contexts."
0,"The concept that we live in small world networks connected by short paths has proved fascinating. These networks, however, do not typically emerge as linear responses to individual-level changes; rather, subtle changes in relations produce extraordinarily different macrolevel outcomes. Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult. He offers an index to calculate how much inaccuracy or imprecision relational definitions or data-gathering techniques can tolerate before results yield utterly different interpretations."
0,"We propose that social capital, defined as resources embedded in individual and organizational networks, produces expressive and instrumental civic actions. The 2000 Social Capital Benchmark Survey data were used to examine the hypothesis. Structural equation modeling confirmed that (1) individual social capital was the consistent and significant predictor of both expressive and instrumental civic actions; (2) organizational social capital played the most important role in predicting instrumental civic actions, although it was not significant in predicting expressive civic actions; and (3) civic actions are gendered: women were more likely to be involved in expressive civic actions, but the female dominance disappeared in the realm of instrumental civic actions.

0,"Maternity leave policies are designed to ease the tension between women's employment and fertility, but whether they actually play such a role remains unclear. We analyze the individual-level effects of maternity leave on employment outcomes and on second conception rates among Russian first-time mothers from 1985-2000 using retrospective job and fertility histories from the Survey of Stratification and Migration Dynamics in Russia. During this period Russia experienced tremendous economic and political turbulence, which many observers believed would undermine policies like maternity leave and otherwise adversely affect the situation of women. Nevertheless, we find that maternity leave helped women maintain a foothold in the labor market, even during the more turbulent post-transition period. Also, women who took extended leave (6-36 months) in connection with a first birth had elevated rates of second conceptions after they returned to the workforce."
0,"Over the past two decades, adolescent depression has increasingly been recognized as a serious public health problem.  The estimated prevalence rate ranges from just over eight percent to nearly 19 percent, with females having approximately twice the prevalence rate of males.  In addition, a growing body of research suggests that many adolescents will continue to struggle with symptoms of depression as they make the transition from adolescence to young adulthood.  While previous research has made important contributions to our understanding of the health risks associated with adolescent depression, these studies faced many serious limitations.  This study, based on nationally representative longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), draws on ideas from life course theory and the social stress perspective to extend our knowledge about the long-term consequences of adolescent depression for adult health and well-being.  Latent growth curve modeling will ultimately be used (1) to identify the developmental processes by which histories of depressive symptomatology influence trajectories of risky health behavior across the transition from adolescence to young adulthood and (2) to examine how gender, an important determinant of social structural position, is linked to physical health and mortality risk through differential exposure and vulnerability to mental health problems."
0,"Residential community gates have created new physical imageries that support a segregated city. Based on ethnographic data from four residential communities in Puerto Rico—two private, two public, and one of each gated—I focus on “gardens” as physical and symbolic mechanisms that enforce class and race exclusion through gating. Gardens have become a way to beautify and improve city spaces, to make communities more equitable, healthier, and safer. But they can be “green veneer[s][that]ostracize those ‘others’ of different classes and colors who d[o] not fit into the story” of Eden.  For the rich of Ponce, gardens threatened by urban complexity, proximity to public housing and fear of crime, are recovered and protected behind gates, symbolic of a lifestyle of privilege, security, and order. In contrast, the poor in multi-family gated public housing are funneled to regulated community centers or the renewed city’s urban public spaces with private and public overseers, the axis of a regulated community life where residents are disciplined and monitored. As gardens are purported to be an extension of life, and urban renewal projects are deemed to make life in the city better, they can also segregate communities behind perverted symbols of beauty and order."
0,"This article examines the prevalence, predictors and outcomes of unmarried mothers' repartnering patterns following a nonmarital birth. Results indicate that, within five years after a birth, approximately two-thirds of unmarried mothers end their relationship with the focal child's biological father, and more than half of these mothers enter new partnerships. Among those who repartnered, 60 percent of mothers formed unions with men who had higher economic capabilities than their former partners, 20 percent formed unions with men of similar capabilities, and 20 percent formed unions with men who had lower capabilities. This pattern holds for both nonresidential and coresidential unions. Our findings are consistent with marriage market, learning and evolutionary biology theories about union formation, and they provide support for qualitative evidence that unmarried mothers have high standards for new partners. While many mothers find new partners who seem to offer a higher level of economic security, many other mothers remain unpartnered, likely due (at least in part) to the limited pool of potential partners with relatively high levels of economic promise."
0,"This discussion proposal will involve the presentation of my master's thesis (in progress) that seeks to determine the existence of a relationship between country level participation in international environmental treaty regimes and actual environmental health through a cross sectional, multiple regression analysis.  It is being argued that network centrality in international environmental regime formation has a positive impact on the development of environmental institutions within nations, and that these institutions in turn act as the mechanism to improve environmental health.  Data on 140 countries measuring levels of environmental health, network centrality in environmental regime formation, presence of intra-national environmental institutions, industrialization, urbanization, and population density was compiled for the analysis.  Results indicate that the net effect of network centrality on the presence of intra-national environmental institutions and environmental health is significant and positive.  Within a broader context, this finding lends support to new institutionalist and regime theoretic claims that international relations can be cooperative and guided by norm formation in contrast with the realist outlook that advocates a rational choice and competitive nation-state model.  Because the main independent variable is a centrality measure that links countries to each other via environmental treaties, the finding also lends support to the theoretical orientation pioneered by Georg Simmel and refined by Ronald Breiger that situates the emergence of social structure in the duality between actors and groups."
0,"Adult learners can be a valued resource in community-based learning classes in that they require less supervision and bring more experience into the classroom. We compared civic values, political participation, and evaluation of community-based learning experiences for two age cohorts of students, 23 years and younger and 24 years and older, at a mid-sized regional four year college in the Midwest. Adult students more so than younger students became civically involved while participating in a university-wide civic engagement effort. Greater percentages of adult students reported speaking out about and educating others on social issues, they boycotted and buycotted products to a greater extent, and played a larger role in community problem solving than younger students. With regard to participation in community-based learning projects, both adults and youth equally benefited from the experience, but greater percentages of adults than those in the younger cohort said the experience did not take time away from class work and felt they were well supervised. Despite the fact that adult students are more likely to be enrolled in school part-time and have greater work and family commitments than younger students, they can be seen as mentors and leaders for others."
0,"This study examines how the neighborhood environments experienced over multiple generations of a family influence children's cognitive ability. Building on recent research showing strong continuity in neighborhood environments across generations of family members, the authors argue for a revised perspective on ""neighborhood effects"" that considers the ways in which the neighborhood environment in one generation may have a lingering impact on the next generation. To analyze multigenerational effects, the authors use newly developed methods designed to estimate unbiased treatment effects when treatments and confounders vary over time. The results confirm a powerful link between neighborhoods and cognitive ability that extends across generations. A family's exposure to neighborhood poverty across two consecutive generations reduces child cognitive ability by more than half a standard deviation. A formal sensitivity analysis suggests that results are robust to unobserved selection bias."
0,"Nonviolent insurrections and revolutions have become increasingly attractive topics of research for social scientists in the last few years. However, most of the research has focused on the practical and strategic concerns and difficulties faced by nonviolent activists and movements. Theoretical problems and questions related to nonviolent revolutions have oftentimes been ignored by researchers. This essay introduces the concept of nonviolence-receptive ideologies (NRIs) and its importance for nonviolent movements. NRIs are secondary commitments to nonviolence that occur through more salient ideologies of a particular movement. I argue that a commitment to nonviolence can take place within a movement even if the commitment is not to nonviolent values specifically. The concept of NRIs is used to explain why some revolutions and movements turn out nonviolent while others do not."
0,"This paper tests whether there is a causal relationship between homeownership and civic engagement in working-class, urban neighborhoods.  We theorize that homeownership can provide a pathway for involvement in formal local organizations, but this effect is moderated by residential mobility.  Using a sample of low- and moderate-income homeowners and a matched sample of renters, we collect data on civic engagement, tenure, and mobility over a 4-year period of time.  We find that people who became homeowners during the study period were no more involved in formal organizations prior to homeownership than renters who did not become homeowners, but their involvement increased significantly after they purchased a home.  We also find that long-time homeowners who move are more likely to get involved in community groups in their new neighborhoods, while renters who relocate are not.  We discuss the implications of this finding for policies aimed at supporting homeownership in lower-wealth urban neighborhoods."
0,"Recent studies show that firms and workers benefit from the geographic concentration or spatial agglomeration of employment in a local labor market. While economic geographers have devoted considerable attention to the benefits firms receive from spatial agglomeration, the reasons workers may benefit in the form of higher wages are less clear. I draw from several theoretical perspectives in order to explain the relationship between spatial agglomeration and wages for U.S. biotech workers, including the new economic geography, new structuralism, organizational ecology, and the new economic sociology. Using the 1990 PUMS-L, I employ a hierarchical linear model in order to test hypotheses from these perspectives. The results indicate that biotech workers benefit more from industrial than urban agglomeration, and these benefits are primarily due to the greater degree of organizational diversity in large industry clusters and urban labor markets."
0,"This paper examines the impact of peer demographic and interpersonal process characteristics on the achievement of young black and white adolescents. I use structural equation modeling on data from Prince Georges County, Maryland to determine the direct and indirect effect of peer demographic characteristics, such as racial and socioeconomic composition, on adolescent achievement. I also explore the impact of the quality of the friendship and peer academic behavior on youth ninth grade math test score and grade point average. Overall, several key findings emerge. First, although not often considered in previous studies, these results clearly show that peer sociodemographic characteristics matter. The percentage of black friends, friends with college educated mothers, and friends of the opposite sex all influence adolescent academic performance. The results also show that racial differences in achievement are explained by peer demographic and interpersonal process characteristics. Finally, the results suggest that different factors matter for white and black youth. White youth are strongly influenced by having black peers. In contrast, black youth are influenced by a much larger array of friend characteristics such as percentage of friends of the opposite sex and friendship stability."

Addressing this research gap, we analyze the congruence of time use information assessed through retrospective questionnaires and through experience sampling methodology.

0,"This article reexamines the relationship between economic growth and free market policies, as they are assessed in a broad and active literature that draws on the Frasier Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) data set.  Past studies generally support the EFW’s claims that “freer” economies growth faster.  I highlight three commonly-employed, but problematic assumptions, that underlie earlier, confirmatory results: that (1) the EFW is strictly a measure of free market capitalism, (2) previous studies’ results are robust to sample composition, and (3) that the relationship between freedom and growth does not change over time.  When these assumptions are explored empirically, a different picture of neoliberal policies’ relationship with growth emerged.  Neoliberal policy seems to distinguish fast- from slow-growth countries in only one period – the early 1990s – a time when developing countries’ embrace of such reforms were being rewarded with public debt refinancing and an emerging markets investment mania.  I theorize that the apparent relationship between neoliberal policy and growth may be a product of developing countries having received relief from the chronic systemic financial crises that plagued them in the 1980s.  I test this proposition by examining the relationship between laissez-faire policy, public debt relief and foreign capital infusions since 1980, and find that neoliberal policies exert no effect on growth net of these controls."
0,"Using insights from ethnographic studies of conservative Protestant congregations, the authors propose and test a refined conceptual model of theological conservatism that accounts for three key components of a theologically conservative worldview: (1. epistemology, a belief in the Bible as the inspired word of God, (2. ontology, assumptions about the pervasiveness of human sinfulness, and (3. soteriology, the conviction that salvation is made possible through a commitment to Jesus Christ. Structural equation modeling is used to examine the reliability and validity of this model across data sets and relativity to current approaches used in the study of religion. The proposed measure exhibits a substantial improvement for defining and interpreting the influence of religious conservatism across and within sociodemographic groups in contemporary American society."
0,"This study explores the relationship between student perceptions of parent educational expectations and parent-child relationship affective quality, support for independence, and parental involvement in education, in an effort to understand those factors that might influence the interpersonal and intergenerational transmission of educational values. We conceptualize these qualities of the parent-child relationship as positive dynamics enhancing the communication of parental expectations as perceived by the child/student. We control for family income and parent education level. Results revealed the demographic controls only marginally predicted perceptions of parent educational expectations as this model did not reach significance. The regression analysis reveals that parent-child relationship quality explains a significant proportion of the variance in parental expectations over and above family structural characteristics. The affective quality of the mother-child relationship and parent involvement in the student’s education are both positively related to parent educational expectations and confirm the propositions laid out for this study."
0,"The theoretical potential of ethnography in analysis of culture is in the surprising finding it is able to generate. To maximize the potential of discovery, the data should be detailed and arranged in form that allows the data to speak. To explicate the this potential, I analyze it the third way which is not inductive and not deductive but rather abductive, following the logic of Charles Sanders Pierce. The principle of abduction combines two forms of reasoning, and insight and an explanation which is in the form of rule-following procedure. In ethnography this means arriving at an educated guess and then explicating that insight with theoretical reasoning. The warrant is in the ethnographic detail and the theoretical reasoning which explicates it. This is an open-ended process on knowledge creation so that validity of this combined reasoning is in its lack of closure, that is, its on-going possibility of reinterpretation."
0,"This article evaluates whether market forces encourage education organizations to strategically win over customers and outsmart the competition in ways that improve the quality of programs and instruction. Drawing on interviews with eighty representatives from three forms of private education businesses, this paper finds that these actions are rarely tied to the competitive environment. Instead, these actions are tied to a variety of non-strategic rationales such as entrepreneurs’ self-concept as educators.  To understand this response, we conceptualize market forces as just one of the many resources entrepreneurs draw on in their everyday decision-making. This paper opens the black box of private education organizations, and offers a nuanced addition to mounting research that challenges the connection between competition and school performance."
0,"A well-established body of literature documents how immigrant patients have been marginalized in the healthcare system in the United States, but little is known about this patient group’s subjective experiences of or strategic responses to their own powerlessness. Guided by Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus and capitals and drawing on 60 in-depth interviews with low-income, LEP (limited English proficiency) Mexican and Vietnamese immigrants in Northern California, my study reveals two patterns of empowerment among these patients. The practice of “institutional hidden transcripts” was a common strategy for both patient groups to alter providers’ agendas without directly confronting them. The practice of “medical pluralism” was used differently by my interviewees. Whereas the Mexican immigrants engaged in it as a coping strategy for inadequate medical access, Vietnamese patients resorted to medical pluralism for dealing with superficial medical consultations, especially regarding biomedical uncertainties. Institutional hidden transcripts contributed to patients’ greater sense of control within the institutional context of Western medicine; medical pluralism brought more patient options across institutional boundaries. These findings advance our theoretical understandings of the roles of non-dominant habitus and cultural capital. Furthermore, it highlights how immigration intersects with class in shaping habitus."

Although there has been no consensus on the best way to construct standardized logistic regression coefficients, there is now sufficient evidence to suggest a single best approach to the construction of a standardized logistic regression coefficient(1) that can be used in the same way across a broad range of problems as the standardized linear regression coefficient and also to suggest the adequacy of other approaches for limited purposes.

0,"This essay examines factors that produce political unity among large U. S. corporations advocating free trade. Expanding on old debates, these data and analyses validate the importance of organizational and class cohesion approaches to corporate political action. Methodologically, the political unity of pairs (dyads) of firms in trade policy activism is analyzed with quadratic assignment procedure regression. Shared membership in prominent policy networks and board interlocks positively predict corporate political unity across three areas of trade policy influence, from the executive branch to the legislature. Non-network organizational indicators also significantly predicted corporate trade policy activism. The findings support business unity accounts of corporate political action and suggest that higher levels of firm embeddedness within intercorporate networks facilitate collective corporate political action."

The major research question of this study was to what extent American retirees’ migration to foreign countries is sustainable for the sending and receiving countries given the health care and other financial issues? This study used a purposive sampling technique to collect data from State of Jalisco, Mexico. Data were collected from 80 US expatriates through a survey which included both open-ended as well as structured questions. The survey included respondents’ general demographic and socio-economic characteristics, migration related questions, and health condition and utilization related questions.  In addition, content analysis of retirement migration trends and consequences was conducted to examine sustainability of the trends. Analysis shows that international retirement migration creates win-win situation for both the sending and receiving nations. Almost all US retires reported being happy with their migration decision. Only unavailability of Medicare B coverage abroad was reported as the major barrier in retiring in foreign countries."
0,"Using data from the US Current Population Surveys 2006-2008, I examine the weekly work hours of Mexican immigrants. Mexican immigrant workers on average work 2-4 h less than non-Hispanic whites per week, which contradicts the popular portrait of long immigrant work hours. Four mechanisms to explain this gap are proposed and examined. Results show that the work time disparity between non-Hispanic white and Mexican immigrant workers is explained by differences in human capital, ethnic concentration in the labor market, and selection process into employment. English proficiency has limited effect on work time after location in labor market is specified, while the effect of citizenship status remains robust. "
0,"In this article, we consider how the economic return to a college education varies across members of the U.S. population. Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis."
0,"This article charts key developments and cross-national variations in the coverage of foreign culture (i.e., classical and popular music, dance, film, literature, theater, television, and visual arts) in Dutch, French, German, and US. elite newspapers between 1955 and 2005. Such coverage signals the awareness of foreign culture among national elites and the degree and direction of ""globalization from within."" Using content analysis, we examine the degree, direction, and diversity of the international orientation of arts journalism for each country and cultural genre. Results denote how international arts and culture coverage has increased in Europe but not in the United States. Moreover the centrality of a country in the cultural ""world-system"" offers a better explanation for cross-national differences in international orientation than do other country-level characteristics, such as size and cultural policy framework. Recorded and performance-based genres differ markedly in their levels of internationalization, but the effect of other genre-level characteristics, such as language dependency and capital intensiveness, is not clear In each country, international coverage remains concentrated on a few countries, of which the United States has become the most prominent. Although the global diversity of coverage has increased, non-Western countries are still underrepresented."
0,"Classical urban theory proposes that more rural people are likelier to combine commercial and personal relationships, while more urban people segregate them. The 1996 GSS module on buying behavior (DiMaggio and Louch, 1998) allows us to test that proposition. It asks about several buys that respondents made and then asks what the relationships of the respondents were to the vendors. Respondents in the smaller places tend to have known the home seller, car dealer, and home-repair contractor from whom they had bought -- but not the lawyer or private car seller. Multivariate, hierarchical analysis finds one robust effect: rural residents were more likely to have previously conducted business with their vendors, but there was no significant effect of place on having had a personal relationship to the vendors. The simplest explanation for rural residence’s independent effect on having had a previous business tie is the relative scarcity of providers in the most rural places."
0,"Historically, cultural capital is a method of controlling resources and reinforcing a social structure that gives consumers of highbrow culture an advantage over consumers of lowbrow culture.  Research indicates that high-status persons have more culture capital, operationally defined as passing knowledge of cultural fields, with which they can develop social ties and increase social mobility.  If, however, as Peterson (1996) finds, both high-status and low-status Americans are becoming more omnivorous, what distinguishes the taste patterns of the status groups?  Do American status groups have different taste patterns than European status groups?  The goal of this paper is to compare American musical taste patterns using Survey for Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA) data from 2002 to published findings on Dutch musical taste patterns (Van Eijck, 2001).  This study tests Petersons omnivore hypothesis and explores American taste patterns for 21 musical genres.  Three unique findings emerge from our analysis.  First, in contrast to Petersons findings regarding the omnivore hypothesis, our findings support the finding by Van Eijck (2001) that education is a better predictor of omnivorousness than occupational status.  Second, Americans are more omnivorous than the Dutch.  Finally, when compared to the Dutch, Americans have greater differentiation and breadth across musical genres.  Theoretical implications and findings are discussed."
0,"Using evidence from Durham, North Carolina, we examine the impact of school choice programs on racial and class-based segregation across schools. Reasonable assumptions about the distribution of preferences over race, class, and school characteristics suggest that the segregating choices of students from advantaged backgrounds are likely to outweigh any integrating choices by disadvantaged students. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations. Using information on the actual schools students attend and on the schools in their assigned attendance zones, we find that schools in Durham are more segregated by race and class as a result of school choice programs than they would be if all Students attended their geographically assigned schools. In addition, we find that the effects of choice on segregation by class are larger than the effects on segregation by race. "
0,"Employment during high school represents an important step toward independence, although pseudomaturity theory posits that over-involvement in paid work during adolescence signals a premature entry into adulthood, thereby leading to problem behaviors such as substance use. Pseudomaturity theory assumes that work intensity and other adult-like behaviors are a configuration of symptoms, and thus it is problematic to use a traditional regression based framework to test such an idea. To test the clustering of behaviors hypothesis of pseudomaturity theory precisely, this study uses fuzzy set analysis to examine the extent to which a set of behaviors--including work intensity, substance use, and family relationshipsform a cohesive configuration. Analyses draw on the National Survey of Youth and Religion (n=3,290), which includes data from parents and their teenagers (ages 13 to 18), to study intensity of work, parental monitoring and closeness, and both alcohol and marijuana use. Results show strong support for the conjunction of work intensity with distance from parents and substance use. Yet, there are distinct variations based on age, showing that younger adolescents, whether users or non-users, more often experience a conjunction of multiple parenting practices than older adolescents."
0,"A country’s credit risk is called Sovereign Risk. It refers to the risk of default by the central government of a given nation. The reason it is relevant is that the Sovereign Risk rating, with a few exceptions, becomes the “ceiling” for all other entities located within that country – ranging from corporations to local governments. As such, beyond the impact on a country’s access to credit markets, these ratings also affect all local corporations and local governments. And while some raise the possibility that “borrowing countries adopt policies that address the short-term concerns of portfolio investors, even when they are in conflict with long-term development needs” (Elkhoury 2007 pg 11), the issue has yet to receive any systematic, quantitative treatment. This paper attempts to deal with that issue by quantitatively estimating the determinants of Sovereign Risk Ratings, and their usefulness in predicting defaults in Latin America. Our main finding is that neoliberal policy adoption has a significant and positive impact on the rating assigned to a nation, but bears little to no relationship to whether a nation defaults on its debt. Similarly, sovereign risk ratings themselves are very poor predictors of default. These findings point to a situation where ratings serve as a strong incentive for neoliberal policy adoption, even as they are not useful in preventing defaults. Therefore, credit rating agencies are important actors in explaining the diffusion of certain policy paradigms across the developing world."
0,"Durkheim's emphasis on the role of emotion in social life has been influential in the development of the sociology of emotions. Others have analyzed Durkheim's distinctly social conception of reason and rationality. However, the interconnections between ""emotion"" and ""reason"" in his thinking have seldom been directly and systematically addressed. These interconnections deserve further explication and development, particularly as they apply to the level of language and action-i.e., ""practical reason""-in everyday life. Seeing the collective emotional basis of ""social facts,"" in general, and ""logic,"" ""reason,"" and the basic ""categories of the understanding,"" in particular, opens up new applications for Durkheim's broader theoretical framework."
0,"This research examines the influence of types of protest activities, Congressional hearings and political characteristics on environmental legislation enacted from 1961-1990. We find that rates of environmental protest rise with increases in the amount of previous institutional activities, but extra-institutional activities do not raise the overall rate of protest. Protest has no direct effect on the passage of legislation, but institutional protest activities significantly raise the rate of Congressional hearings on the environment. When comparing all environmental law's to those designated as having a major impact, we find both similarities and differences. For example, prior legislative activity decreases both rates, but increases in criteria air pollutants and partisan characteristics of Congress significantly affect only the rates of major environmental legislation."
0,"This article retrieves the ethnic roots that underlie a universalist class ideology. Focusing empirically on the emergence of Bolshevism, it provides biographical analysis of the Russian Revolution's elite, finding that two-thirds were ethnic minorities from across the Russian Empire. After exploring class and ethnicity as intersectional experiences of varying significance to the Bolsheviks' revolutionary politics, this article suggests that socialism's class universalism found affinity with those seeking secularism in response to religious tensions, a universalist politics where ethnic violence and sectarianism were exclusionary, and an ethnically neutral and tolerant ""imperial"" imaginary where Russification and geopolitics were particularly threatening or imperial cultural frameworks predominated. The claim is made that socialism's class universalism was as much a product of ethnic particularism as it was constituted by it."
0,"Although a macro-organizational perspective has become increasingly commonplace in social movement analyses, few studies examine the full spectrum of organizations in any single social movement industry (SMI). Utilizing a unique source of data on Japanese environmental movement organizations, we compare characteristics of groups focused primarily on environmental issues with those for whom environmental issues are part of a larger multi-issue focus. We then profile across distinct, and theoretically important, organizational domains to assess how local, prefectural and national groups compare on a variety of organizational attributes, including: size, membership type, tactics and activities, and issues. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for understanding both Japanese environmentalism and the structure of SMIs generally."
0,"This study uses national survey data in federal election years from 1996 through 2004 to examine voter registration and voting. It shows that racial/ethnic disparities in socio--economic resources and rootedness in the community do not explain overall group differences in electoral participation. It contradicts the expectation from an assimilation perspective that low levels of Latino participation are partly attributable to the large share of immigrants among Latinos. In fact net differences show higher average Latino participation than previously reported. The study focuses especially on contextual factors that could affect collective responses of group members. Moving beyond past research, significant effects are found for the group's representation among office holders, voting regulations and state policies related to treatment of immigrants."
0,"Single mothers leaving welfare face a web of obstacles in accessing childcare subsidies. However, welfare leavers perceptions about their experiences and about work supports for which they are eligible, including childcare subsidies, are not well documented in the literature. This paper develops a model of childcare selection and subsidy use among welfare leavers. Findings suggest the level of trust between parents and childcare providers, related to bad experiences with center-based care, and the availability of information about child care facilities were important decision making criteria. Efforts to work with this population need to address lack of information about subsidies to increase the range of child care alternatives and quality and also promote trusting relationships between social workers and welfare leavers."
0,"Sociologists of religion have often connected secularization to science, but have rarely examined the role of religion in the lives of scientists or how the sciences have changed religiously over time. Here we address this shortcoming by comparing religiosity between two samples of elite academic natural and social scientists, one in 1969 and one in 2005. Findings show an overall decline in religiosity among university scientists as well as a change in their religious composition. Attendance rates were lower for social scientists in 1969 compared to natural scientists, but in 2005 growing parity in attendance occurred between the two fields. Findings also show a decline in the proportion of Protestant scientists and a growth in Catholic scientists. Demographic factors associated with religiosity in the general population, with the exception of age and having children, had no impact among elite academic scientists. Overall, findings challenge and revise older studies on the role of religion in the lives of scientists. Specific results are connected to theories that pose science as a master identity, which may be mitigated by some institutionalized aspects of religion. They also lead to new directions in the sociology of religion that take seriously the role of religion in the lives of elites and connect societal religious changes to differences between institutional spheres, particularly those, such as the academy, that play a leadership role in society."
0,"Many basic questions in the social network literature center on the distribution of aggregate structural properties within and across populations of networks.  Despite this, little work has been done on inference for the properties of graph populations, or on methods for comparing such populations.  Here, we attempt to rectify this gap by introducing a family of techniques that combines an existing approach to the identification of structural biases in network data (the use of conditional uniform graph quantiles) with strategies drawn from Bayesian meta-analysis.  The resulting methods allow for principled inference regarding the distribution of structural biases within (and comparison across) populations of networks, given data sampled at the network level.  Algorithms are provided for carrying out the associated computations, and examples are provided of applications to the analysis of social structure within urban communes and radio communications among emergency personnel."
0,"Recent experimental evidence has demonstrated how a prison record reduces employment outcomes for entry-level job applicants (Pager 2003). Yet many employers today also have access to applicants arrest records, even for misdemeanor cases that never resulted in formal charges. We here present experimental evidence from a new audit study testing the extent to which employers consider low-level arrest records in making hiring decisions. Our team sent matched pairs of African American and White men to apply for jobs, experimentally manipulating whether they reported or did not report a low-level criminal record during the application process. We find a modest effect of arrest records on employability, with callback rates about 4 percent lower for the experimental group than for the matched control group. Implications for public safety, racial disparities, and the accessibility of arrest records are discussed."
0,"This paper connects theories of organizational ecology and identity and cultural consumption of meaning and authenticity. This type of study is timely because scholars have witnessed an increase in specialized, peripheral, or niche markets in recent years. As markets have become more concentrated by just a few dominant producing organizations, peripheral space has freed up for specialists to thrive within.  However, studies in organizational ecology have little to say about why there is rising consumer demand for niche goods and their perceptions of specialists at the micro level. The literature in Culture and Economic Sociology offers theories for why these peripheral regions are growing in late-stage Capitalism through heightened postmodern consumer demands.  One particular niche movement that is thriving across the United States is the local organic foods market. In order to discover the nuanced motivations that connect both niche consumers and producers, I am in the process of conducting an ethnography on a local organic farm located in Tucson and a series of interviews with key consumers in this type of local market, particularly entrepreneurial chefs and customers of their CSA share at their  farmer’s market booth.  The goal of the study is to discover the varied yet precise issues surrounding organizational resource space, form and identity, niche price determination, and consumer demands and desires that support this movement.  The proposed research also seeks to further develop organizational identity theory by uncovering in what contexts it becomes advantageous for a niche organization to develop a focused versus complex identity."
0,"Violence against police officers is often understood as either an extension of normal violent behavior framed in terms of social disorganization and structural disadvantage or as a result of political subordination in keeping with political conflict theory.  While these theories are undoubtedly important in explaining some of the violence against police officers, they tend to ignore police department organizational characteristics and/or assume that these characteristics have only minimal influence on violence against police officers.  Using data from the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted Records (LEOKA) dataset and the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey, this study examines the independent and combined effects of disorganization, conflict, and organizational characteristics on violence against police officers.  Findings indicate that all three processes contribute to violence against police officers.  Structural measures of disorganization and conflict, specifically, unemployment, segregation, and the presence of a black mayor are significant predictors of police officer victimization.  Additionally departments with protective gear regulations, more stringent education requirements, and higher proportions of black officers experience less violence against their police officers."
0,"The social and human capital that educational attainment provides women enables them to better navigate their children's passages through school. In this study, we examine a key mechanism in this intergenerational process: mothers' selection of early child care. Analyses of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development revealed that maternal education was positively associated. with configurations of child-care characteristics (i.e., type, quality, quantity) most closely linked to children's school readiness. This association was not solely a function of mother's income or employment status, persisted despite controls for many observable confounds (e.g., maternal cognitive and psychological skills, paternal characteristics), and, according to post-hoc indices, was fairly robust in terms of unobservable confounds."
0,"Using June CPS Fertility Supplements for cohorts born before 1964, we describe cohort trends in premarital births. We decompose trends into components explained by delayed marriage (and hence longer exposure of risk to pregnancy), more conceptions per time at risk (suggesting increased sexual activity), and declining rates of responding to premarital conceptions with ""shotgun"" marriages. Arguing against Wilson's ""marriageable men"" thesis, we show similar trends for blacks and whites that go back to cohorts born way before men's employment and wages declined.  We conclude that before the baby boom, increased sexual activity was key; and after the baby boom, trends were explained by fewer conceptions resolved with a marriage before the birth."
0,"In this paper, I examine the discourse on class in public education through a critique of Ruby Paynes (2003) A Framework for understanding poverty. Paynes work, which currently benefits from great popularity among educators and school administrators, is based on the notion that the education community can come to an understanding of poverty effects on education through understanding the culture of poverty. Foregrounding the ideological underpinnings of Paynes work, I argue that in addition to being dependent on recycled, previously discredited arguments about the poor; her work, which includes professional development workshops, education reform consulting, and seminars open to the public, in contrast to fostering an understanding of poverty, perpetuates class oppression, sexism and racism."
0,"Shanahan and his colleagues (in press) recently reported a strong association between a dopamine receptor polymorphism (DRD2 TaqIA) and educational continuation. Specifically, drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health they show that DRD2 risk (A1A2 and A1A1 allleles) is associated with a substantial decrease in the likelihood of continuing education to the college/university level for both white and black males. The present study examines plausible social mechanisms that might explain this relationship. Preliminary analyses show that for both white and black males, lowered educational expectations mediate the relationship and, for white males only, lowered grades in mathematics and impulsive decision-making. On-going analyses continue to examine possible mediators. These results will be discussed in terms of how genetic data can help understand social processes such as those associated with educational attainment."
0,"Culture has been considered important in HIV/AIDS prevention intervention because people often act on their behavioral expectance that is culturally meaningful.   This paper is aimed at critically reviewing the culturally-competent models and empirical evidence that are relevant to HIV/AIDS culturally-grounded prevention intervention.  It finds that despite the consensus of the importance of culture, the theories guiding culturally-grounded HIV/AIDS intervention prevention are still underdeveloped.  Furthermore, empirical evidence of effectiveness of culturally-grounded intervention is rare.  This paper argues that clarification of theories that address the relationship between behavioral models, cultural intervention, and intended outcomes precedes the development of effective culturally-grounded HIV/AIDS prevention intervention."
0,"Previous research has found that a nation's income inequality does not affect its happiness inequality. This article questions the appropriateness of the standard deviation as measure of happiness inequality used in these studies. Our main criticism concerns structural dependency, i.e. the technical dependency of the standard deviation on a nation's mean happiness which is induced by measuring happiness with limited rating scales. To overcome this drawback, two new measures are proposed which adjust for the effects of limited instruments. Applying these new measures to the most recent World Values Survey data demonstrates that some countries change their ranking in the league table of happiness inequality considerably. Moreover, income inequality does affect corrected happiness inequality, a finding which has significant public policy implications. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"With data from random sample household surveys conducted simultaneously in major cities in Greece and in Russia, we evaluate the import of individuals' morality relative to expected utility and self-control in predicting criminal probability. In addition, we examine potential interactions among the three variables in predicting criminal propensity and compare their relative effects across the two samples. The results suggest that all three factors are important and mostly independent influences in explaining criminal probability. However, the estimated effects of morality are substantially stronger than those of either expected utility or self-control, and all three of these explanatory variables appear to be somewhat sensitive to cultural contexts. Overall, our findings confirm that morality plays a comparatively larger part in explaining conformity than is generally recognized by major contemporary theories, although the data cannot show whether morality is an element in rational decision making or represents a contrary ""non-rational"" element in accounting for human conduct.

0,"This paper explores the various roles that children play in ethnographic research.  Based on the limited literature on children in the field, and drawing on examples from various ethnographies across social science disciplines, I identify four main roles for children: 1) as wedges, or as instrumentally important in terms of helping their parents gain access in various ways, 2) as collaborators, 3) as objects of study, and 4) as subjects of study. I also discuss the ways in which the roles of children in ethnography illuminate methodological issueslike reflexivity, validation, ethics, and power and agency.  This is the first attempt to integrate writings on taking children into the field and works on conducting fieldwork with children.  In thinking about the ways in which various child relationships affect the kinds of ethnographic work we produce, in both positive and negative ways, we can consider how best to integrate the worlds of adults and children in the field and in subsequent analysis."
0,"Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, I analyze the association that students' extracurricular activities have with two academic outcomes: mathematics achievement test scores and college expectations. I consider changes between cohorts and gender differences within each cohort. While prior achievement and expectations have the strongest associations with the dependent variables, relationships do appear between extracurricular participation and the dependent variables. There is only one cohort difference in the association between activities and math achievement test scores; computer use was positively associated with students' scores in the 1990s, but had no association with students' scores in the 2000s. School-sponsored activities were associated with higher scores for all students, while television-watching and hanging out with friends were negatively associated with them. School activities were positively associated with the college expectations of students in both cohorts, while spending time hanging out with friends was negatively associated with expectations, especially for students in the later cohort. There were a few gender differences in the association between activities and math scores, but no gender differences in the association between activities and college expectations. The findings indicate that many of the same activities are relevant for math achievement and college expectations in the two time periods."
0,"Previous scholarship has demonstrated the importance of individual characteristics and structural context for understanding social capital formation. However, a developmental approach to social capital formation has, so far, been absent. In this study, I argue that social capital formation must be understood intergenerationally as well as structurally. Using hierarchical linear modeling, I investigate the hypothesized intergenerational transmission of social capital using Waves 1 and 2 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The results show that, in addition to individual characteristics, neighborhood-level factors, and school-level variables, parental social capital is an important predictor of adolescent social capital. This study also suggests that the intergenerational transmission of social capital functions, in part, through family structure and that structural differences account for only a relatively small share of the variation in adolescent social capital. Potential explanations for these findings are discussed."
0,"In this paper I discuss how a set of local residents in a rural, predominantly Hawaiian, and under-resourced island led a striking defeat of a powerful land owner’s tourism development plans on Moloka‘i, in the state of Hawai‘i. This case shows how the relatively powerless can draw upon cultural resources and land use regulations in order to assert influence over development.  Community members employed place narratives and cultural frames, which helped congeal local opposition to a luxury residential development and which also resonated with key public decision-makers. This paper offers an empirically-grounded institutionalist analysis of land development.  It aims to illustrate the utility of drawing upon tools of analysis from urban political-economic theory as well as cultural sociology—concepts like narratives, cultural capital, frames, and “institutions as culture.” In this case, the cultural and institutional context of development provided tools and opportunities for under-resourced groups to influence development.  This analytical approach arguably captures the ‘real politics’ of urban development better than theoretically one-sided tacks."
0,"Scholarship on nationalism and the state has examined how immigration and nationality policy create boundaries of inclusion and exclusion. While a handful of countries of immigration have been analyzed extensively, explanations of nationality law have not accounted adequately for countries of emigration or mixed migration. This papers historical analysis of Mexican nationality law and its congressional debate demonstrates that the ways the state has defined the nation at different periods cannot be attributed simply to migration patterns, external models, or legacies of the past, according to the expectations of received theory. The literatures focus on geopolitically stronger countries of immigration obscures the critical effects of inter-state politics on nationality law in subordinate states. Mexicos nationality laws reflect its experiences as a geopolitically weak country of immigration, despite a net outmigration of its population. Local political actors have reinterpreted nominally universal principles of nationality law in ways suggesting there is not a consistent relationship between legacies of ethnic or state-territorial understandings of nationhood and the respective legal principles of descent and territory."
0,"Much research attention has been devoted to understanding the relationship between education and riskier sex-related behaviors and HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. While in the early 1990s researchers found that increases in education were associated with a higher incidence of HIV/AIDS, this relationship appears to have reversed and better educated people, especially women, appear less likely to engage in riskier sex-related behaviors and have a lower incidence rate of HIV/AIDS. Our study begins to unravel the mechanisms that could explain why women's educational attainment is associated with safer sex-related behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from the 2003 Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey, we examine the potential mediating effects of HIV/AIDS knowledge, family planning discussions, gender empowerment, and husband's education for explaining the relationship between education and age of first sex, casual sex, multiple sex partners, and condom use. We find that gender empowerment partially explains the relationship between education and age of first sex, and HIV/AIDS knowledge, husband's education, and family planning discussions partially explain the relationship between education and condom use. We argue that gender inequality and lack of knowledge are likely to play a greater role in explaining the relationship between woman's education and sex-related behaviors in sub-Saharan Africa than they do in more industrialized nations, where social capital explanations may have more explanatory power.

0,"In October 1962, the fate of the world hung on the U. S. response to the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. President Kennedy's decision to impose a blockade was based on hours of discussions with top advisers (the so-called ExComm), yet decades of scholarship on the crisis have missed the central puzzle: How did the group select one response, the blockade, when all options seemed bad? Recently released audio recordings are used to argue that the key conversational activity was storytelling about an uncertain future. Kennedy's choice of a blockade hinged on the narrative ""suppression"" of its most dangerous possible consequence, namely the perils of a later attack against operational missiles, something accomplished through omission, self-censorship, ambiguation, uptake failure, and narrative interdiction. The article makes the very first connection between the localized dynamics of conversation and decision making in times of crisis, and offers a novel processual account of one of the most fateful decisions in human history."
0,"This study analyzes the impact of childhood socioeconomic status on midlife obesity and extends the research by estimating the influence of intergenerational social mobility on midlife obesity. People who experience “social immobility” could be those who are stuck on the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, or those that occupy the ceiling.  Past studies do not separate these two social groups and overlook the fact that people who are stuck in the bottom may have a more serious risk of obesity and related illnesses, compared to those who experience downward social mobility. Other studies also neglect the fact that people who are immobile at the ceiling may have better health outcomes compared to those who experienced upwardly social mobility. By using the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey, this study provides the evidence that social mobility has a medicating effect on one’s obesity while pointing out that people who stayed in the bottom 10th percentile of SES after 35 years had highest effects on the risk of obesity after controlling their childhood and adulthood SES."
0,"Recent years have seen a surge in social movements that target corporationsover their labor practices, environmental impacts, benefits for same-sex partners, and a variety of other issues.  Social movement theorists and researchers have taken only preliminary steps toward explaining the dynamics of these movements.  We examine existing theories of industry opportunity structures and incorporate ideas about globalization and grievances in order to explain the dynamics of firm-targeting in the labor rights and anti-sweatshop movement of the 1990s.  Using an original and unique dataset on campaigns targeting apparel, textile, and footwear firms, we develop systematic analyses (using panel models) of why some firms are targeted to a greater extent than others.  Why, for instance, did Nike, the Gap, and others become synonymous with the sweatshop stigma while other companies escaped this scrutiny?  Our findings confirm some of the prevailing wisdom about the vulnerabilities inherent in corporate reputation and particular market positions.  Yet we also find that these opportunity-based arguments take us only part of the way toward explaining this wave of activism.  The globalization of production matters in important waysand we find that activists tended to punish the most aggressive globalizers.  In addition, we find evidence that the local embeddedness of activism matters, in that companies located in centers of activism tend to be targeted more than others.  We use these findings to inform the growing literature on anti-corporate movements and the intersections of social movement theory and organizational theory."
0,"Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

0,"We are still unsure what matters in campaigns to win elections. On the one hand, early work shows that campaigns have little influence over voter choice; on the other hand, later work shows that campaigns do influence voter choice. Recent investigations in what matters in campaigns have highlighted narrative politics to describe the influences of story-telling processes in campaigns over traditional retail politics. Though depicted dichotomously, they are not in practice. In this paper, narrative politics and ""retail politics"" highlight the important intersection of the narrative construction of identity as part and parcel of the materialistic construction of the political campaign for public consumption. Hence, narrative interpellates retail politics such that candidates hope voters will buy their politics with votes. Yet, the question still remains: do narratives matter in campaigns? This paper argues that they do not, because political clout dominates campaigns and elections."
0,"Our current agrifood system relies on a wide array of labels, certifications, and standards, many with an explicitly environmental focus.  Many of these labels are private, third-party certifications rather than strictly governmental standards; even many government standards such as the United States Department of Agriculture National Organic Program (USDA NOP) are actually a hybridization of state-led and private regulatory schemes.  Environmental certifications and labels vary significantly in terms of the creation and content of standards, auditing and enforcement, and preferred environmental practices.  This study of three voluntary organic and environmental regulatory schemes in New Zealand’s dairy industry examines the way these schemes work in practice.  I examine the structure of these environmental certifications and the mechanisms for feedback and change within the standards.  Who is able to directly address the content and application of the standards?  How are they created and changed and who is given a voice in the process?  How does enforcement vary across the standards?  I argue that the hybrid state/private regulation of the current USDA NOP has failed to address the shortcomings of either state-led or private regulation.  Instead, USDA NOP certification lacks transparency for both consumers and producers, increases concentration of regulatory power in non-democratic institutions, and allows inconsistency in environmental practices and outcomes.  In contrast, Demeter certification has structured their regulation to increase democracy and transparency and has successfully overcome some of the limitations of mainstream organic certifications."
0,"This article examines changes in attitudes toward marriage and children in Austria, (West) Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the U.S. using the data from the 1988, 1994, and 2002 waves of the International Social Survey Programe (ISSP). Consistent with the ideas of the second demographic transition and the rise of post-materialism, public opinion in these countries is shifting away from traditional norms of universal marriage and childbearing. Female, never married, better educated, employed, and relatively secularized individuals hold less traditional views about marriage and children in all countries. Furthermore, attitudes of married and never married in Austria and Germany, males and females in the U.S. became more polarized, which might be attributed to public policies to increase fertility and promote traditional marriage in these countries. Large unexplained cross-national differences also point at the importance of contextual factors for understanding recent changes in support for marriage and children."
0,"In this paper, I test the liquidity constraint theory facing entrepreneurs as they start new businesses.  Previous research points toward a positive relationship between wealth and financial resources of entrepreneurs and the viability of the organizations they found.  Specifically, I focus on whether financial resources positively impact the rate of achieving operating status in the new ventures.  Using data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED), I found that household income and personal financial contributions positively contributed to reaching operational status more quickly, while household net worth did not have any association.  Other factors such as start-up experience, both previous and current, had a negative impact on the rate of achieving operating status."
0,"Studies examining determinants of divorce have largely ignored differences between factors that elevate wives' and husbands' initiation of divorce. The authors use longitudinal data and a latent class model embedded in a competing-risks event history model to assess distinct predictors of wives and husbands leaving marriages. They find that when men are not employed, either spouse is more likely to leave. When wives report better-than-average marital satisfaction, their employment affects neither spouse's exit. However, when wives report below-average marital satisfaction, their employment makes it more likely they will leave. The authors' findings suggest that theories of divorce require ""gendering"" to reflect asymmetric gender change."
0,"One of sociology's classic puzzles is how groups motivate their members to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status, exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem."
0,"Although gene by environment studies are typically based on the assumption that some individuals possess genetic variants that enhance their vulnerability to environmental adversity, the differential susceptibility perspective posits that these individuals are simply more susceptible to environmental influence than others. An important implication of this perspective is that individuals most vulnerable to adverse social environments are the same ones who reap the most benefit from environmental support. Using longitudinal data from a sample of several hundred African Americans, we found that relatively common variants of the dopamine receptor gene and the serotonin transporter gene interact with social conditions to predict aggression in a manner consonant with the differential susceptibility perspective. When social conditions were adverse, individuals with these genetic variants manifested more aggression than other genotypes, whereas when the environment was favorable they demonstrated less aggression than other genotypes. Furthermore, we found that these genetic variants interact with environmental conditions to foster schemas and emotions consistent with the differential susceptibility perspective and that a latent construct formed by these schemas and emotions mediates the gene by environment interaction on aggression."
0,"The onset and escalation of alcohol consumption and romantic relationships are hallmarks of adolescence. Yet only recently have these domains jointly been the focus of sociological inquiry. We extend this literature by connecting alcohol use, dating, and peers to understand the diffusion of drinking behavior in school-based friendship networks. Drawing on Granovetter's classic concept of weak ties, we argue that adolescent romantic partners are likely to be network bridges, or liaisons, connecting daters to new peer contexts that, in turn, promote changes in individual drinking behaviors and allow these behaviors to spread across peer networks. Using longitudinal data of 449 couples from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate Actor-Partner Interdependence Models and identify unique contributions of partners' drinking, friends' drinking, and friends-of-partners' drinking to daters' own future binge drinking and drinking frequency. Findings support the liaison hypothesis and suggest that friends-of-partners' drinking have net associations with adolescent drinking patterns. Moreover, the coefficient for friends-of-partners' drinking is larger than the coefficient for one's own peers and generally immune to prior selection. Our findings suggest that romantic relationships are important mechanisms for understanding the diffusion of emergent problem behaviors in adolescent peer networks."
0,"This paper addresses the questions of why people help others and how expectations for a personal return factor into decisions to help.  Attempts to explain helping phenomenon are often construed as some type of altruism where the actor expects no return for her good will or as some type of reciprocal relationship where the actor receives back directly from the other or from someone along a chain of generalized exchanges.  Using data I collected from a Haitian immigrant community, I analyze how actors helping exchange networks are formed through cognitive processes of connecting what may otherwise appear to be unrelated instances of help given and help received.  This is best captured in the oft-heard phrase what goes around comes around.  While other kinds of exchanges are certainly evident in this community, I focus my attention on how people make such cognitive connections between acts of goodwill and benefits received, and thus how people socially construct their own personal helping exchange networks.  While this paper provides details unique to immigrants, and to Haitians in particular, I attempt to bring out elements that are generalizable to other populations as well."
0,"Using 2005 National Household Education Survey data, this paper compares the effects of child and family characteristics on early childhood education and care use for children of foreign born mothers versus children of native-born mothers. Maternal nativity serves as a proxy for maternal immigration status in an effort to determine if child and family characteristics differentially predict enrollment. We consider relative, non-relative, and center-based care arrangements in two age groups: 0-2 and 3-5 years old. Multivariate analyses reveal that once demographic differences are controlled, patterns of use are mostly similar irrespective of maternal nativity. "
0,"The 1990s witnessed the launching of two ambitious trade regionalization plans, the Nafta and EU enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe.  In contrast to previous projects for the creation or expansion of regional trade blocs, these two projects concerned states at dramatically different levels of economic development:  The Nafta involved the very wealthy economies of Canada and the USA and the significantly poorer economy of Mexico, whereas EU enlargement involved the very wealthy economy of the 15 member-state European Union and the significantly poorer economies of former Communist states in Central and Eastern Europe.  While the United States and European Union governments were uniformly in favor of these treaties, political parties and interest groups reacted in sharply contrasting ways.  In North America opposition to the Nafta was widespread, whereas in the pre-enlargement European Union there was anxiety and criticism but rarely outright opposition.  This dramatic contrast reflected in part the different degree to which national labor relations and welfare state institutions on both sides of the Atlantic had in the past buffered the impact of globalization and competition from emergent economies on the workers’ living standards.The paper relies on secondary documentary and statistical sources combined with primary source data from a survey to trade union top representatives collected in 2008 in the United States, Austria, France, Germany, and the UK."
0,"This study investigated the rate and correlates of homelessness among adult jail inmates.  Data from a national jail survey was based on a random sampling survey of both convicted inmates and inmates being held prior to adjudication (N=6,953). Homeless inmates (i.e., those who experienced an episode of homelessness anytime in the year prior to incarceration) made up 15.3% of the U.S. jail population.  Logistic regression was used to examine the extent to which homelessness was associated with factors, such as symptoms or treatment of mental illness, previous criminal justice involvement, and demographic characteristics.  In comparison to other inmates, those who had been homeless were more likely to have committed a property crime, to have past criminal justice system involvement for both non-violent and violent offenses, to suffer from mental health and substance abuse problems and to be older, less educated, more likely to be unemployed, have an income of less than $1000, and single.   Homeless people who are incarcerated in jails are far more disadvantages than other inmates.   They are also more likely to be in jail less than one month. Implications for service delivery to homeless inmates are discussed."
0,"Although the positive association between education and health is well documented, it is unclear how this relationship varies with age and over time.  The few existing reports of socioeconomic inequalities in health by age are based primarily on cross-sectional samples or short-term longitudinal follow-ups of one or two years.  This paper follows two cohorts of women from the National Longitudinal Surveys over three decades to see how health advantages of high educational attainment and disadvantages of low educational attainment change as people grow older.  I show how research design can influence conclusions made by researchers studying aging and health inequalities.  Specifically, odds ratios from cross-sectional analyses reveal converging education-based health differences with age.  Longitudinal analyses, however, show stable or diverging differences in health status by educational attainment with increasing age.  Highlighting the need to understand education as a process not as a fixed characteristic attained by early adulthood, I find that women who continue to engage in formal learning throughout middle and older age have improved chances of avoiding health problems.  Finally, I find that part of the education-based gap in health is due to womens differential engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking, immoderate eating, and drinking."
0,"This paper offers an historically, institutionally and culturally sensitive account of the crystalization of the particularly martial elements of hegemonic masculinity in modern Europe and North America at the turn of the eighteenth century.  The emergence of a new set of state-based practices of war-making during ‘the age of democratic revolutions’ provided the critical impetus for the elevation of duty, sacrifice, honor, courage and camaraderie to a central place in culturally dominant meanings of masculinity.  The key to this transformation lay in the new relationship forged by the state between citizenship and soldiering during revolutionary war—one that not only fundamentally shaped the content, contours and contradictions of the culturally dominant ideal of western masculinity, but also revealed the peculiar persistence of the new elements of that ideal even in the face of lived experience of soldiers and civilians that routinely disconfirmed it."
0,"One of the great challenges associated with cross-occupational collaboration is that even when top managers provide tools to allow members of different occupations to work together, collaboration often fails as members of higher status occupations use these very tools to enforce occupational boundaries and protect their privilege. Our 12-month comparative ethnographic study of two hospital units demonstrates the importance to cross-occupational collaboration of what we call “jurisdictional faultlines”—hypothetical dividing lines that split members of higher-status and lower-status occupations within a workgroup into relatively homogenous subgroups (or not) based on the strength of occupational group members’ alignment along demographic attributes such as race, age, ethnicity or nationality. In this paper, we demonstrate that a weak jurisdictional faultline can minimize expressions of in-group favoritism and out-group hostility and lead to successful cross-occupational collaboration. These findings have implications for research on cross-occupational collaboration and jurisdictional battles in organizations."
0,"Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was a top-secret city of the Manhattan Project created for the sole purpose of producing an atomic bomb. Perhaps surprisingly, there are two interlocking tropes that are primarily used to describe the town’s early construction and design: the frontier and utopia. In Oak Ridge, the frontier and utopian imaginations do not compete so much as nestle alongside and within each other. Of course the frontier and utopian imaginations are not unique to the former secret atomic city of Oak Ridge, but characteristic of other regional and national myths as well. What is unique is how these common tropes are used to tell the story of a particular town at the emergence of atomic modernity.  This paper focuses on the utopian design of the town, the social segregation that emerged, and the nostalgic longings that many residents feel for the early atomic landscape of Oak Ridge."
0,"Do regime change and market reform disrupt patterns of intergenerational mobility? China's political trajectory is distinctive from that of other communist regimes in two ways. During its first three decades, the regime enforced unusually restrictive barriers to elite status inheritance. And during the subsequent market transition, unlike most of its counterparts, the Communist Party survived intact. Data from a multigeneration survey suggest that despite their obvious exclusion from the party and related administrative careers in the Mao era, certain prerevolution elites transmitted one type of elite status to their offspring to a surprising degree. Party elites, in contrast, were hit hard by radical Maoism but recovered quickly afterward, and their offspring inherited elite status at much higher rates."
0,"The racial cleavage in death penalty support has been explained with the dual paradigm hypothesis in which whites and blacks are thought to have unique perspectives on social issues.  We revisit the question why race, in many models of death penalty support, is the single biggest predictor.  We consider four theoretical possibilities of how racial-social ecological context may bear on the dual paradigm hypothesis: a social threat hypothesis, a social contact theory of prejudice, a theory of social influence, and finally a merging of a paradox of integration with a theory of status inconsistencies.  We find intriguing support for the last perspective  that residential integration leads to increased attitude polarization.  On the other hand, we find no support that increased black-white opportunities for social influence diminish racial attitude polarization.  Our analysis provides a fresh understanding of the role of segregation and of status in formation of public opinion."
0,"During China's Cultural Revolution, a large proportion of urban youth were forced to go to the countryside as a result of the state's ""send-down"" policy. Past research has been ambivalent about the long-term social consequences for the Chinese youth who experienced send-down. Some scholars have suggested that the send-down experience may have yielded beneficial effects. To test this claim, we analyze data from the Survey of Family Life in Urban China, which we conducted in three large cities in 1999. Questions available in this data set allow us to ascertain the send-down experience of both the respondent and a sibling and educational attainment at the times of send-down and return. Our analyses of the new data show that the send-down experience does not seem to have benefited the affected Chinese youth. Differences in social outcomes between those who experienced send-down and those who did not are either non-existent or spurious due to other social processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Drawing on analyses of American and French news reports on ""overweight"" and ""obesity,"" this article examines how national context-including position in a global field of nation states, as well as different national politics and culture-shapes the framing of social problems. As has been shown in previous research, news reports from France-the economically dominated but culturally dominant nation of the two-discuss the United States more often than vice versa, typically in a negative way. Our contribution is to highlight the flexibility of anti-American rhetoric, which provides powerful ammunition for a variety of social problem frames. Specifically, depending on elite interests, French news reports may invoke anti-American rhetoric to reject a given phenomenon as a veritable public problem, or they may use such rhetoric to drum up concern over an issue. We further show how diverse cultural factors shape news reporting. Despite earlier work showing that a group-based discrimination frame is more common in the United States than in France, we find that the U. S. news sample is no more likely to discuss weight-based discrimination than the French news sample. We attribute this to specific barriers to this particular framing, namely the widespread view that body size is a behavior, akin to smoking, rather than an ascribed characteristic, like race. This discussion points, more generally, to some of the mechanisms limiting the diffusion of frames across social problems. Keywords: social problems, obesity, overweight, news reporting, France."
0,"Although seemingly a personal act, naming a child can often be a highly regulated process. This is particularly the case for indigenous people, whose preferred names may not appear of official state lists of approved names. This can be for a variety of reasons: indigenous people may not speak the dominant language, or they may want to express an identity that differs from the national identity, and thus use names as a way to draw boundaries around their particular group membership and identity. In this paper, I examine the politics around naming policies and regulations in Argentina as they relate to indigenous people. I first look at the policies themselves and how they might impact indigenous parents’ choices of names for their children. I then trace the efforts of a Mapuche indigenous organization in southern Argentina to try to control the process of naming when parents give their children Mapuche names. Theoretically, I frame this analysis in terms of multicultural citizenship, as this gives insight into how conflicts over membership are negotiated. I argue that through their reactions to naming policies, indigenous activists are actively producing the contours of multicultural citizenship in Argentina."
0,"This article highlights the shifting boundaries between the public and private spheres in advanced capitalist societies through an examination of grassroots lobbying firms. These organizations, which became a fixture in U.S. politics in the 1970s and have grown in number and prominence since, subsidize public participation on behalf of corporations, industry groups, and associations using direct mail, telephoning, and by mobilizing members and stakeholders. I examine the dynamics of this organizational population whose existence calls attention to broad transformations in civil society-with reference to dramatic growth in the organizational populations of civic and trade associations. Results, derived from a Generalized Estimating Equation panel regression of firm founding events across U.S. regions from 1972 to 2002, suggest that the increasing formal organization of civil society has supported the development of a field of organizations that subsidize participation. These organizations do so, however, in a manner that restricts the development of social capital and civic skills while augmenting the voice of private interests in public and legislative discourse."
0,"This paper examines how the Great Recession in 2008-2009 has affected volunteering behaviors in the US and the UK. Using large survey datasets from two countries, we assess the recession effects on both formal volunteering and informal helping behaviors. We find not much evidence that formal volunteering has changed significantly as a result of the Great Recession in two countries. In fact, formal volunteering has remained remarkably stable in the US during the Great Recession. We do, however, find that there has been a substantial decline in informal helping behavior in both countries. The timing of the decline in both countries strongly suggest that the Great Recession is responsible for the decline. Moreover, in the UK, the decline is mostly concentrated among the people who experienced economic hardship due to the recession, further indicating the link between the Great Recession and the decline in informal helping behavior."
0,"The value-in-diversity perspective argues that a diverse workforce, relative to a homogeneous one, is generally beneficial for business, including but not limited to corporate profits and earnings. This is in contrast to other accounts that view diversity as either nonconsequential to business success or actually detrimental by creating conflict, undermining cohesion, and thus decreasing productivity. Using data from the 1996 to 1997 National Organizations Survey, a national sample of for-profit business organizations, this article tests eight hypotheses derived from the value-in-diversity thesis. The results support seven of these hypotheses: racial diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, greater market share, and greater relative profits. Gender diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, and greater relative profits. I discuss the implications of these findings relative to alternative views of diversity in the workplace."
0,"Racial threat scholars have long argued that racial prejudice is motivated by threat. This literature identifies two types of threat: individual threat and group threat; however, actual arguments tend to focus on only one of the two types of threat. Consequently, there has been no assessment of whether both threats are simultaneously associated with prejudice. This paper uses data from the 1994 General Social Survey (GSS) to examine the relationship between perceptions of individual threat, perceptions of group threat, and opposition to policies aiding blacks. Results from multinomial logits demonstrate that both threats are associated with opposition to race-equalizing policies, suggesting that single-threat theories should be reevaluated and that studies incorporating racial threat should include both types of threat.

0,"This article explores racial/ethnic differences in community knowledge as a contributing mechanism through which residential segregation in U. S. cities is perpetuated. If whites, blacks, and Latinos are familiar with different communities, and that familiarity is influenced by community racial/ethnic composition, then these ""blind spots"" may constitute one barrier to integrative mobility. We address three questions: (1) Do blacks, whites, and Latinos have different community blind spots?; (2) Do blacks, whites, and Latinos of the same social, economic, and geographic backgrounds still have different blind spots?; and (3) Do the racial/ethnic characteristics of the community predict a racial/ethnic difference in blind spots, net of the respondent's and the community's other characteristics? Employing logistic regression and hierarchical linear models with data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study, we explore how whites, blacks, and Latinos differ in their knowledge of actual communities in the Chicago metropolitan area and whether differences persist after controlling for social class characteristics. Results show strong evidence that community knowledge is shaped by race-both of the resident and of the target community. Policy implications of the results are discussed."
0,"Past research on international migration from Mexico to the United States uses geographically-limited data and analyzes emigrant-sending communities in isolation. Theories supported by this research may not explain urban emigration, and this research does not consider connections between rural and urban Mexico. In this study we use national data from Mexico to investigate rural and urban emigration. We find that a central motivation for emigration - self-insurance through labor market diversification - is most relevant to less rural, non-metropolitan places. Paradoxically, while Mexican cities have the lowest rates of emigration, the rural places that are spatially proximate to cities have the highest rates. These findings suggest that while urban development retains emigrants within city borders, it may generate emigration out of neighboring rural places."
0,"At the individual level, residence is linked to patterns of social interaction. On a structural level, residential location is linked to access to resources and social mobility. Given these links, scholars have examined the intersections of race and class with residential segregation, and residential preferences. Most of these studies focus on patterns for different ethnic groups as a whole. However, very little is known about the residential patterns of a particular kind of household: single (never-married) and living alone (SALA). To better understand how racial residential segregation corresponds to changing marital patterns in the U.S., this study moves beyond the existing literature and focuses on the spatial segregation patterns of household types. We compare the residential segregation of black SALA households, a subset of non-family households and a rapidly growing segment of the population, to white SALAs, white married-couples, and black married-couples; and we examine how group and metropolitan characteristics influence these patterns. Using the dissimilarity index of neighborhoods in U.S. metropolitan areas and the 2000 Census Summary File 3, we find that black SALAs are less segregated from white SALAs than from white married couple households. Smaller income differences among SALA households might account for these segregation patterns."
0,"This paper concerns the causal link between the intensity of contingent employment and the structures of the labor market that affect it. Previous studies on contingent employment have devoted much attention to either organizational factors or job characteristics that are assumed to be prevalent in contingent jobs. However, occupational dimensions of labor market structure need to be clarified in that they have distinct effect on jobs being contingent. Based on the CPS basic datasets and its supplement on contingent employment, the extent to which labor market structures affect the intensity of contingent employment is tested. Given the lack of longitudinal data on detailed job categories, the pattern of job mobility merit attention in that labor market structures of jobs concerned can be measured in a predictable way. Thus, tenure ratio, defined as the ratio of occupational to employer tenure of job incumbents, as an indicator of labor market dimensions is used while other variables regarding labor market sectors and institutional effects such as unionization have still left much variance unexplained. In addition, panel analyses with four waves shed light on the directions toward which each job moves in terms of contingency."
0,"Few studies have considered how earnings inequality estimates may be affected by measurement error in self-reported earnings in surveys. Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation with their W-2 earnings records, we examine the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on economic inequality estimates."
0,"Sociological research has not adequately assessed levels of support for redistributive policy among African Americans. This oversight is particularly notable considering the dispersion of blacks across the American class structure. This article seeks to fill this gap in our understanding by addressing two concerns: (a) whether blacks with higher versus lower socioeconomic status espouse disparate policy preferences and (b) whether a privileged class position matters in the same way in structuring black and white beliefs about the role of government. Results from pooled data from the 1996 through 2006 General Social Surveys indicate that blacks more strongly support government efforts to ameliorate inequality than whites. However, black policy preferences fluctuate after controlling for intraracial socioeconomic differences. Privileged blacks are less supportive of racially-neutral opportunity-enhancing and outcome-based policies; these same respondents espouse contrasting levels of support for racially-specific policies. The implications for these findings are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research."
0,"While great progress has been made in documenting that organizational practices affect workplace inequality, little is known about how managers in particular may shape the careers of the employees below them. Using unique longitudinal personnel data on managers and their subordinates, this study identifies and tests for evidence of three distinct mechanisms by which managers potentially influence the assessment of employee performance in the workplace: (1) social network influence between employees' current and former managers; (2) manager-manager (horizontal) homophily; and (3) manager-employee (vertical) homophily. I find evidence of the independent effects of all three mechanisms of managerial influence on the outcome of disagreement in the performance evaluation ratings of the same worker between former and current managers. In particular, my results stress that both managerial network influence and horizontal homophily affect the process of employee performance assessments, over and above the well-studied vertical homophily mechanism. I conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of these findings for future research regarding the interactional aspects of workplace inequality within contemporary organizations."
0,"Research on the consequences of social movements typically aims to identify determinants of success, or to draw attention to ways that social movements are able to secure new benefits for constituents by gaining concessions from political authorities.  Yet social movements, even those that fail to achieve their stated goals, may have an enduring impact on the communities in which they were once active.  This impact may be far removed from the movements stated goals and may be detrimental to constituents and to society at large.  We identify an empirical relationship between contemporary crime rates in southern U.S. counties and Ku Klux Klan activism that occurred in the mid-1960s.  We find that various measures of economic deprivation affect the crime rate, with these effects being strongest in counties where the Klan had once been active.  Drawing on social movement theory and theories of crime and delinquency, we argue that Klan activism disrupted community cohesion and undermined the perceived legitimacy of legal authority in ways that helped to produce contexts that are conducive to crime within communities characterized by economic deprivation."
0,"This study investigates whether the mechanisms why education is rewarded vary across countries. Do educational institutions affect the likelihood that support for a particular mechanism is found? Combining IALS survey data and OECD statistics on educational institutions, it was shown that the effect of measured skill on earnings - controlled for educational attainment - is lower in countries where educational institutions produce skills relevant for work through the vocational system. This indicates that the human capital perspective on education works particularly well in vocationally oriented educational systems, as the skills generated in education are strongly overlapping with the skills that are rewarded. An alternative mechanism sees education as a means for social closure through credentialization. Under the credentialization model, education is not primarily rewarded for the productivity-enhancing skills it entails, but rather for reasons unrelated to productivity. Following this theory education is used for selection into the organization, after which directly observable skills are determining wages. Assuming that a strongly differentiated educational system creates boundaries between social groups, it is hypothesized that strongly differentiated systems lead to stronger measured skill effects. We do not find support for this hypothesis. "

Extending the Durkheimian approach to crime, law, and social control, this study discusses the anguish and anger provoked by the infraction, tributes to the fallen animal, calls for more severe and certain sanctions for poaching, and the boundaries affirmed in the incident’s aftermath. The implications of this societal response to a wildlife offense for criminalization and conceptions of community are considered"
0,"This paper uses American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data to describe the time use of teenagers ages 15-17, with a focus on activities that may affect teenagers' well-being such as sleep, eating, schoolwork, and selected leisure activities. We find that teenagers with an employed mother spend less time on homework and computers, are less likely to eat with parents, but spend more time in supervised activities. Teenagers with a single mother spend more time in paid work, are less likely to eat dinner with their parent, and spend more time in unsupervised activities, but they also get more sleep. Adolescents with more educated mothers spend more time studying and on the computer, less time watching television, and are more likely to eat dinner with parents. Family income correlates positively with teenagers' paid work, homework, computer use, and the likelihood of eating with parents, but is negatively associated with sleep. Family size is positively related to time spent in caregiving activities, sleep, and eating with parents, but is associated with less computer use. "
0,"Previous research on adolescents in age discordant relationships suggest a wide range of negative outcomes for the adolescent.  Using three waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, in this paper we explore the connection between involvement in age discordant relationships for adolescent girls and depression.  We find that girls who enter into age discordant relationships are no more or less likely to be depressed beforehand, are more likely to be depressed during or shortly after the relationship, but are no more or less likely to be depressed several years later.  While the current paper does suggest negative mental health outcomes during or near the relationship, there appear to be no lasting effects."
0,"Using ethnographic and interview data, this article explores how labor market transformations affect gender norms and family life in a rural community that has historically been tied to a single industry. It argues that the gender strategies pursued by couples heavily impact their relationships and families. Flexibility with regard to gender norms is key to creating stable relationships in a context of labor market change that threatens the existing gender order. For couples that are tied rigidly to traditional breadwinner/homemaker gender roles, men's inabilities to be the sole providers create marital and family tensions. On the other hand, couples in which men are able to refocus their conceptions of masculinity on more attainable goals such as active parenting experience less strife and more satisfaction. The research finds that rural men are more flexible with regard to masculine identity than found by previous scholars, particularly with regard to conceptions of fatherhood. The article explores in depth the processes and discourses that facilitate flexible gender identities in this conservative rural community."
0,"Declines in support for the male breadwinner, female homemaker family model in recent decades have been thoroughly documented, but research into the way such attitudes change over the lifecourse remains limited. Drawing on panel data and latent growth curve modeling techniques, the study identifies patterns and predictors of attitude change from 1977 through 1993. Women support for gender specialization in marriage declined rapidly from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, but this was followed by an interval of stability until the mid-1990s. Education is negatively associated with support for the male breadwinner model, but there was educational convergence in attitudes between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. The results highlight the critical role Of women's employment for explaining the pattern of attitude change across the lifecourse."
0,"How the growing Latino population fits into the U.S. racial structure is a subject of considerable debate. Are Latinos developing into a separate racial group, becoming part of the dominant group, or creating a panminority group with nonwhites? Extending beyond existing research that uses intermarriage or survey data to assess racial boundaries, this study examines Latinos' stated racial preferences for dates among a sample of over 4,000 Internet daters in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta. We find that few Latinos prefer to only date other Latinos. Latinos are much more likely to prefer to date whites than blacks, and are much more likely than blacks to prefer whites, suggesting that the Latino-white boundary is less rigid than Latino-black or black-white boundaries. However, Latinos are also much more likely to prefer blacks than whites are. Further analyses highlight differences in racial preferences among Latinos by metropolitan.area, educational level, language, and religion. Greater proximity to blacks in New York and Atlanta promotes greater acceptance. In these locales, we see some indications of a panminority group of blacks and a small set of Latinos developing. While the majority of Latinos accept racial hierarchies that privilege whiles, providing evidence that many are assimilating into the dominant group, assimilation patterns vary for different segments of the diverse Latino population."

However, investigating the process of expectation formation back to the elementary grades yields insights not evident when analyses are limited to the high school years: (1. many youth consistently expect to attend college from as early as fourth grade; (2. the expectations of middle- and low-SES youth are less stable, and across years the preponderance of their exposure to socialization influences mitigates against sustained college ambitions; (3. long-term stable expectations are more efficacious in forecasting college enrollment than are changing, volatile expectations As anticipated in the Wisconsin framework, family- and school-based socialization processes indeed contribute to social reproduction through children's educational expectations, but the process starts much earlier and includes dynamics outside the scope of the original status attainment studies."
0,"New York has had a long history of immigration. Liberians are among the newest group settling in New York. Most Liberians entered the U.S. as refugees of whom many have found new homes in Park Hill, Staten Island. This ethnography discusses the role of refugee resettlement policies and resettlement agencies and the relationship between Liberian refugees and African Americans in Staten Island’s North Shore. In addition, the author analyzes how the Park Hill neighborhood has shaped its residents and vice versa."
0,"This study aims examining and comparing the history and the current state of labor migrants and marriage immigrants, the governments policy of foreign labor and marriage immigration, and the roles of NGOs, the mass media, and the general public in regards to migrant workers and marriage immigrants of Taiwan and South Korea. This comparative approach is expected to enable us to go beyond description and become more analytic enough to develop a theory out of empirical observation. Also, we aim at evaluating pros and cons of the government policy of the two countries and making recommendations that can improve immigration and social integration policy."
0,"We examine the influence of an interstate network created by intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) on the global diffusion of democracy. We propose that IGOs facilitate democracy's diffusion by transmitting information between member states and by interpreting that information according to prevailing norms in the world society, where democracy is viewed as the legitimate form of government. We employ a network autocorrelation model to track changes in democracy among all of the world's countries from 1815 to 2000. We find that democracy does diffuse through the IGO network and that the influence of democratic countries is stronger than that of undemocratic countries. Evidence indicates that the IGO network serves as a basis for normative diffusion. This is an important contribution to sociological accounts of globalization, which tend to emphasize diffusion divorced from network structure or diffusion dependent on the coercive influence of a small set of international organizations."
0,"As jazz began to penetrate the cultural mainstream during the 1920s, not all observers welcomed the musics growing popularity.  While some listeners hailed the music for its verve and tonic-like qualities, others disparaged it as a musical and social scourge that threatened not only artistic standards but also the very fabric of society.  In this article I examine the contention over early jazz as it took shape within the national (US) print media.  In doing so, I emphasize not only what was said about the music, but also who was doing the speaking.  To this end, I relate the discourses used to frame the meaning of jazz to the fields (Bourdieu 1991, 1993) in which the speakers were positioned.   My aim is thus twofold: to shed light on the nature of the contention over jazz, and to explore the robustness of Bourdieus concept of fields as a means for understanding actors position-takings as they seek to encrust their views with the status of truth."
0,"As the sociologist Andrew Abbott has famously observed, professional occupations form a ""system,"" in which the fates of different professions (and hence professionalisms) are linked, sometimes competitively, sometimes cooperatively.   A growing literature sheds light on the impact of information technology, qua technology, on the professionalism of medical practitioners.  However, to understand the implications of the dawning ""information age"" for professionalism in the healthcare sector as a whole, one must look beyond the absorption of IT into the traditional healthcare professions, to consider how the introduction of clinical IT may restructure the ""system of professions"" that constitutes the larger healthcare enterprise.  Clinical IT poses a number of significant governance challenges for healthcare relations, implicating critical issues of integrity, integration, and control.  These governance challenges can -- and to some extent, perhaps, will -- be resolved by a range of essentially non-professional (or even anti-professional) social structures; however, the history and the current direction of American healthcare suggest that one likely consequence of the rising prominence of health information, health information technology, and health information technology governance will be a concomitant rise in the prominence of new ""health information professions"" (HIPs).  This paper lays out some preliminary thoughts on what these new professions will be, who will be their members, and how those members will conceptualize their work, their workplace, and their professionalism."
0,"The specter of the welfare mother loomed large in mid-1990s America and continues to be a symbol of the supposed irresponsible, sexually promiscuous, and immoral behavior of the poor.  Embedded in the notion of the welfare mother are powerful ideologies of race, class and gender which blame the poor for their own poverty, portray women, particularly black and Hispanic women, as promiscuous and inadequate as mothers, and view alternative family forms as pathological.  These ideological strains are manifested in  the encouragement of childbearing and rearing for middle-class and wealthy, white, married couple families and the devaluing of the reproductive actions of others, particularly poor, single mothers.  The welfare mother, envisioned at the bottom of these race, class, and gender hierarchies, is then constructed as a nonproductive citizen and poor mother.  Based on interviews with 37 mothers receiving public assistance, this paper examines how these women resist the dominant constructions by appropriating alternative discourses on motherhood.  By claiming for themselves the title of the good mother, they undermine and reveal the contradictions of the logic of stratified reproduction."
0,"Katrina was the most devastating and deadliest hurricane in recent U.S. history. The storm was particularly destructive for residents of the Mississippi Gulf Coast where sustained winds of 135 mph and a storm surge of 32 feet literally obliterated the built and modified environments. Limited research exists on the chronic (32 months) mental health impacts of survivors in this geographical area. Random-digit dialing telephone surveys were administered in Harrison and Hancock counties (Mississippi) in April and May 2008 and data were collected on a number of mental health outcomes. The results of the calculation of Oridinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models revealed that females, African Americans, and less-educated residents manifested the most severe mental health impacts. Most important, consistent findings for depression and Katrina-related psychological stress indicate that residents who were separated from family members, had maximum residential damage, and suffered severe financial problems remained significantly impacted 32 months after Katrina's landfall. A secondary stressor, in the form of having applications to the Mississippi State Grant Program denied or not processed also predicted personal depression. The implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"Academic achievement is an important determinant of future educational and occupational success.  Friends play an important role in this process.  They provide support and resources that can both encourage and discourage academic achievement.  Consequently, who adolescents choose as friends and how adolescents respond to changes in their friends behaviors may have profound effects on their future stratification.  This paper uses network analysis to model the relationship between changes in academic achievement and changes in network ties.  Using data from the high schools in the Add Health saturated sample of schools, I model network change using an actor oriented Markov chain model.  This model is carried out at the school level, for each of the schools included in the saturated sample.  School level results are then combined in a meta-analysis to describe the general relationship between individual characteristics, network characteristics, and network change.  Through this analysis I show that similarity in academic achievement is an important and consistent predictor of friendship ties in a dynamic context.  High achieving students are more likely to extend ties to other high achieving students, net of other socio-demographic and structural characteristics, while low achieving students are more likely to extend ties to other low achieving students.  Adolescents respond to changes in levels of academic achievement in their friends by either changing their network ties or changing their own academic achievement.  This process maintains similarity in levels of academic achievement across friendship ties and leads the most academically advantaged students to maintain their advantage in their friendships."
0,"The purpose of this paper is to argue for the effectiveness of infusing a social justice perspective  in this case regarding the reduction of HIV/AIDS stigma  into a course on the fundamentals of sociology.  In focusing on HIV/AIDS as a major social issue, students are simultaneously exposed to a variety of perspectives within sociology, as well as given the opportunity to pursue social justice at its most basic level, within the classroom, among their peers, within their friendship and family networks, and hopefully beyond in their future associations.  A foundations course in sociology that follows the basic introductory course but that precedes more advanced courses in theory, methods, and substantive content, seems the ideal point in the curriculum to teach the fundamentals of sociology as well as to expect students to use those fundamentals to dissect a meaningful social concern such as HIV/AIDS stigma.  Using data across three semesters of teaching such a course (N=116), a pre-test/post-test design reveals positive changes in stigmatizing assumptions about people living with HIV/AIDS."
0,"The omnivore is a new form of cultural consumer who uses conspicuous diversity rather than refinement and exclusion to signal his or her high status. This study updates previous research and finds that, contrary to expectations, omnivores are less common in 2002 than they were in 1992. We test whether cohort replacement and other changes in sample composition explain the drop in omnivorousness and we explore five reasons for the remaining period effects."
0,"In this paper, we review a wide variety of programs that are used to support savings by families, in particular by low- and moderate-income families.  These programs range from ones that literally compel families to save, to those that make it hard not to save, make it easier to save, provide financial incentives to induce savings, leverage social networks to support savers, and finally, to programs that excite people to saving.  These programs involve a number of different stakeholders, including governmental entities, social intermediaries, non-profit organizations, and formal financial institutions.  They embody a number of different assumptions about incentives, drawing from rational economics, psychology, and sociology.  We describe examples of each program and provide some information on their economics and effectiveness.  Our goal is not to identify the best program, but rather to underscore the range of possibilities that exists to meet the needs of heterogeneous savers."
0,"The author examines the affective meanings ( evaluation, potency, and activity) that seventy-eight heterosexual married or cohabiting couples attach to the act of financially supporting their family and finds that husbands consider their support more valuable and more active than their wives consider theirs. Using the couple as the unit of analysis, the author considers four hypotheses for these gender differences: job status, deviance neutralization, gender ideology, and gender display. Consistent with the job status hypotheses and inconsistent with the deviance neutralization hypotheses, the husband-wife differences in the evaluation and activity ratings become nonsignificant when spouses have the same job-related status ( earnings, education, and work hours). Consistent with one gender ideology hypothesis, spouses evaluate their family breadwinning more similarly in couples with a liberal wife than they do in couples with a conservative wife. And consistent with a gender display hypothesis, conservative husbands who earn less than their conservative wives evaluate their breadwinning more positively than their wives evaluate theirs, suggesting that conservatives who deviate from gender norms in their relative earnings characterize their breadwinning in a way that neutralizes that deviance. Unexpectedly, the author also finds evidence of ""gender equalization"" among couples with a liberal wife: these spouses view their breadwinning somewhat similarly even when the husband's education exceeds the wife's, suggesting that liberals characterize their breadwinning in a way that neutralizes the deviance ( for liberals) of traditional education differences."
0,"Neurobiological and social psychological studies suggest the existence of non-conscious 'self-other overlap' that can lead individuals to identify with other individuals or groups. This paper investigates whether this effect may help to explain support by some Whites for an otherwise unpopular policy on behalf of African Americans-slavery reparations. A representative telephone survey (n = 1200) serves as baseline of comparison for an online reaction time study with a non-representative sample (n = 1341) that measures 'self-other overlap' (interchangeably referred to as ""implicit closeness"" to Blacks). Partial proportional odds ordered logit analyses reveal implicit closeness to Blacks as the single most powerful predictor of support for reparations among White respondents. The magnitude of the absolute effect of implicit closeness exceeds that of traditional predictors such as racial resentment, ideology, and party identification. Methodological and political implications are discussed. "
0,"This article analyzes race-targeted policy in Brazil as both a political stake and a powerful instrument in an unfolding classificatory struggle over the definition of racial boundaries. The Brazilian state traditionally embraced mixed-race classification, but is adopting racial quotas employing a black/ white scheme. To explore potential consequences of that turn for beneficiary identification and boundary formation, the author analyzes attitudinal survey data on race-targeted policy and racial classification in multiple formats, including classification in comparison to photographs. The results show that almost half of the mixed-race sample, when constrained to dichotomous classification, opts for whiteness, a majority rejects mixed-race individuals for quotas, and the mention of quotas for blacks in a split-ballot experiment nearly doubles the percentage choosing that racial category. Theories of how states make race emphasize the use of official categories to legislate exclusion. In contrast, analysis of the Brazilian case illuminates how states may also make race through policies of official inclusion."
0,"This study uses survey data for 2004 on the general public (N = 788) and public officials (N = 791) in the young post-communist democracy of Estonia to examine individual-level determinants of corruption. The results indicate that both public officials and citizens are more likely to engage in corruption when they do not define corruption as wrong, and when they perceive that corrupt behavior is widespread among their peers. This social learning effect becomes statistically insignificant for those citizens who are extorted. The results provide no support for the most common argument on corruption and compliance that people are more likely to engage in corruption when they are distrustful of their fellow citizens or of government."
0,"This study testifies the developing process of Taiwan and Swedens Motherhood Protection and childcare policies from the point of view of Political Economics and Feminism, and the difference between the completeness and contents of two countries laws.  This study found that most of the Motherhood Protection systems in Taiwan and Sweden are the same, but have two major differences in the contents of welfare: whether the government give applicants subsidies or not, and whether the parental days are special vocations or not.  Fundamentally speaking, these diversities came from the different complete levels in which the two countries practice the spirit of motherhood protection into their laws."
0,"Drawing on institutionalist theory, we conceptualize the racial composition of the boards of directors of large American companies as shaped in response to social and political norms. We use new longitudinal and cross-sectional data to test hypotheses about factors that shape the degree of racial inclusion on boards of directors among large public corporations, and we draw upon in-depth interviews with key participants to gain insights into the mechanisms that are likely to have generated the patterns we detect in our statistical models. We find evidence suggesting that large American corporations manage the racial composition of their elite leadership groups in response to these norms. "
0,"Poverty cause attribution research has sporadically explored social stratification beliefs for over three decades with mixed results. Explanations given for why there are poor people in America may reveal much about underlying structured inequality legitimating mechanisms. Using multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, and frequency distribution analyses, I uncover a conservative-liberal continuum underlying American poverty cause attributions. Past explanations for the mostly mixed nature of American attributions toward poverty are questioned. I suggest a more simple and straightforward explanation: mixed attribution styles, situated on a conservative-liberal continuum, may arise from American's distinguishing between at least two groups of poor peopledeserving and undeservingsuggesting policy and future research agendas."
0,"In this paper, I review relevant prior research about anti-sexist men and attempts by men and women to establish egalitarian relationships.  I then consider experiences that make men’s engagement with anti-sexism more likely.  I note the central importance of relationships with women for motivating the men to take up projects of change and in influencing how these projects take shape.  As Deutsch (2007) points out, “Men sometimes need and want love and care from women enough to be willing to trade power for it.  Love for mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends may even be a force that propels some men into becoming allies in a feminist movement” (p. 122)."
0,"Research on the working poor suggests that the role of non-standard employment in generating poverty of female workers is not always clear. The effect of non-standard employment can be balanced by other sources of income brought home by other members of the household. Poverty, it is argued on the other hand, can be related to standard employment under the conditions of family health, debts or addiction related crises. Thus the exact contribution of non-standard employment to workers' poverty is yet unclear. Our results of a work history analysis suggest that for poor female workers in Israel, non-standard employment converges with an emotional process in ways that narrow down opportunity structures. The work histories taught us that the boundaries between standard and non-standard employment can only be crossed in one direction and that this possibility is a source of intimidation which women struggle to avoid. However, once employed in a non-standard area of the labor market, women with families were unable to go back into standard employment. Non-standard employment turned into a significant turning point which, by generating negative emotions, narrowed down opportunity structures. Our findings are based on qualitative work history analysis conducted upon materials elicited in semi-structured interviews with 12 women."
0,"The paper represents a synthesis of my thesis that examines the linkages between on the one hand, urban transformations and socio-political crises, and on the other, discourses and visions of the city in American films from the 1920s to the late 1940s. I studied urban planning discourses and interventions of the period of study, and analyzed over 30 films in detail (and reference 20 additional related works) by looking at changes in three critical spatial motifs: the New York City skyline, rural-urban contrasts, and public vs. private spaces in films set in suburban environments. I argue that endorsements and critiques in the 1920s of the machine age city are replaced in the films of the 1930s and the 1940s by complex tropes of urban ambivalence. By looking at changing visions of the built environment in film, my study uncovers ambivalent and tension-wrought cultural discourse of simultaneous adulation and condemnation of the metropolis in this critical historical period that preceded suburbanization and urban renewal."
0,"This article examines post-Civil Rights Act trends in private sector managerial representation for white men, white women, black men, and black women. We examine how three factors affect changing access to managerial positions: (1) industrial restructuring, (2) the process of bottom-up ascription, and (3) organizational characteristics. Accounting for compositional shifts in the labor supply, we find that white male managerial overrepresentation remains virtually unchanged since 1966, even while other status groups make gains. A significant portion of the observed equal opportunity advance for women and blacks takes place in the expanding service sectors of the economy. We also find that female and minority gains are enhanced in larger and more managerially intensive workplaces. For all groups, managerial representation is increasingly tied to the presence of similar others in nonmanagerial jobs. Further examination reveals a new status hierarchy of managers and subordinates-a hierarchy wherein white men are likely to manage men of all races. White women, in comparison, are realizing a growing racial privilege in managing women of color."
0,"Where we live shapes the circumstances of our lives; community determines opportunities and limitations. While much research has focused on the effect of community on housed populations, limited research has examined the effect of community on the homeless circumstance. This research proposes to systematically examine multivariate regression models that assess space (opportunity) and place (psychological condition) outcomes among the homeless living in two distinctly different communities. General hypotheses are derived with the expectation that in testing a place-based model, a consistent set of predictors will emerge across the two sample communities. In addition, in testing a space-based model, the predictors should be different across the two sample communities. Descriptive results compare the two communities and homeless samples; regression results provide preliminary support for the distinction between place (CES-D) and space (Access to Opportunity)."
0,"For the inner city poor, moving to a high-poverty neighborhood or a low-poverty neighborhood can set off trajectories of inequality and blocked opportunities that challenge fundamental assumptions of social justice and freedom.  In this paper, I examine residential history data for participants in the Moving to Opportunity Experiment to examine racial and ethnic differences in the pathways of spatial mobility as they unfold over time and particularly focus on their role in reproducing inequality in neighborhood attainment.   As expected, considering the nature and levels of residential segregation that structure the U.S. urban landscape, results indicate that mobility regimes are highly differentiated by racial and ethnic status. I argue that before we can understand the effects of neighborhoods we have to pay attention to differences in the racially and ethnically structured processes governing path-dependent residential trajectories along with the spatially embedded mechanisms of integration and exclusion."
0,"Despite high rates of nonmarital childbearing in the United States, little is known about the health of women who have nonmarital births. We use data from the NLSY79 to examine differences in age 40 self-assessed health between women who had a premarital birth and those whose first birth occurred within marriage. We then differentiate women with a premarital first birth according to their subsequent union histories and estimate the effect of marrying or cohabiting versus remaining never-married on midlife self-assessed health. We pay particular attention to the paternity status of a mother's partner and the stability of marital unions. To partially address selection bias, we employ multivariate propensity score techniques. Results suggest that premarital childbearing is negatively associated with midlife health for white and black women, but not for Hispanic women. We find no evidence that the negative health consequences of nonmarital childbearing are mitigated by either marriage or cohabitation for black women. For other women, only enduring marriage to the child's biological father is associated with better health than remaining unpartnered."
0,"In this paper, I analyze the extent to which the private sphere factors into workers labor market choices in the developing world.  My case study is a town in Costa Ricas Central Valley, which was once a major center of coffee production and now a key investment site for various export and service industries.  The life histories that I collected while living in this town reveal how household structure and family relationships affect occupational outcomes and job choices.  This paper begins with a review of the different ways that researchers have conceptualized the household with regard to economic change.  These conceptualizations, I argue, are limited in that they focus too much on employers, production, and female workers in isolation.  To fill these gaps, I piece apart the life histories and private lives of two workers in Costa Ricas Central Valley  a husband and wife at a later phase in their productive life cycle.  Their histories show that the process by which labor markets are constructed is intimately wrapped up in the process by which households are constructed."
0,"Genetic and other biological explanations have reemerged in recent scholarship on the underrepresentation of women in mathematics and the sciences. This study engages this debate by using international data-including math achievement scores from the Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study and country-level data from the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Values Survey, and the International Social Survey Programme-to demonstrate the importance of social factors and to estimate an upper bound for the impact of genetic factors. The author argues that international variation provides a valuable opportunity to present simple and powerful arguments for the continued importance of social factors. In addition, where previous research has, by and large, focused on differences in population means, this work examines gender differences throughout the distribution. The article shows that there is considerable variation in gender differences internationally, a finding not easily explained by strictly biological theories. Modeling the cross-national variation in gender differences with country-level predictors reveals that differences among high achievers are related to gender inequality in the labor market and differences in the overall status of men and women."
0,"This article investigates patterns of spatial assimilation of Hispanics in U.S. metropolitan areas. Using restricted-use data from the 2000 Census, we calculate Hispanics' levels of residential segregation by race and nativity and then estimate multivariate models to examine the association of group characteristics with these patterns. To obtain a more nuanced view of spatial assimilation, we use alternative reference groups in the segregation calculations-Anglos, African Americans, and Hispanics not of the same race. We find that Hispanics experience multiple and concurrent forms of spatial assimilation across generations: U.S.-born White, Black, and other-race Hispanics tend to be less segregated from Anglos, African Americans, and US.-born Hispanics not of the same race than are the foreign-born of the respective groups. We find some exceptions, suggesting that race continues to influence segregation despite the general strength of assimilation-related factors: Black Hispanics display high levels of segregation from Anglos, and U.S.-born Black Hispanics are no less segregated from other Hispanic groups than are their foreign-born counterparts."
0,"We use the 2003 National Survey of College Graduates to investigate earnings differentials between white and Asian American men. We extend prior literature by disaggregating Asian Americans by their immigration status in relation to the U.S. educational system, and by accounting for the effects of field of study and college type. Net of the latter variables and other demographic controls, native-born Asian American men have 8 percent lower earnings than do measurably comparable white men. Our findings show that Asian American men who were schooled entirely overseas have substantial earnings disadvantages, while Asian American men who obtained their highest degree in the United States but completed high school overseas have an intermediate earnings disadvantage. Net of the control variables, including region of residence, only 1.5-generation Asian American men appear to have reached full parity with whites. Most Asian American men lag at least slightly behind white men in terms of full equality in the labor market net of the measured covariates in our statistical models. No one theoretical approach seems able to explain our findings; instead, we suggest the relevance of several perspectives, including the racialized hierarchy view, the demographic heterogeneity approach, and assimilation theory."
0,"Classic development theory and its contemporary counterparts rely on industrialization as the main driver of changes that produce wide increases in social well-being.  In the original industrializers, manufacturing did indeed enable a broad swath of the population to gain a share of the dynamic productivity increases associated with machine-assisted production.  Yet the evolution of the structure of employment in contemporary developing countries has been and will continue to be dramatically different.  Using historical data on employment by sector in several developed and developing countries, this paper examines the evolution of development trajectories over time. In China, the 21st century analog to Britains 19th century ""workshop of the world,"" manufacturing employment has declined in recent years and seems unlikely to ever absorb more than one-sixth of the workforce.  This will have massive impacts on the development process in the Global South.  Overall, in the absence of East Asian industrialization and the growing real per capital incomes associated with it, conventional ideas of development would seem doomed to extinction, both as theory and ideology. China and the East Asian tigers are, of course, key exceptions to the general disillusionment.  They are consequently the principle exhibits for the defense offered by those hoping to rescue conventional development theory.  How effective this defense will ultimately prove to be will depend on Chinas future evolution."
0,"This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework regarding the evolution of the class divide in postsecondary education. I conceptualize three prototypes of class inequality-effectively maintained, declining, and expanding-and associate their emergence with the level of competition in college admissions. I also unearth the twin mechanisms, exclusion and adaptation, that link class hierarchy to a highly stratified postsecondary system in an allegedly meritocratic environment. Intra- and inter-cohort comparisons reveal that while the class divide regarding enrollment and access to selective postsecondary schooling is ubiquitous, it declines when competition for slots in higher education is low and expands during periods of high competition. In such a regime of effectively expanding inequality (EEI), a greater emphasis on a certain selection criterion (like test scores) in admission decisions-required to sort the influx of applicants-is bolstered by class-based polarization vis-a-vis this particular criterion. This vicious cycle of exclusion and adaptation intensifies and expedites the escalation of class inequality. The results show that adaptation is more effective than exclusion in expanding class inequality in US. higher education."
0,"While much scholarly attention has been focused on the political, cultural, and economic dimensions and determinants of nationalism, comparatively little has been said about its popular meaning or resonance.  Nationalism, writ large, is the project to make the nation.  But the people in whose name the nation is made are largely absent from much of this scholarship on nationalism.  Rather than deducing the salience of nationalism from its political privileging, our aim is to develop a research agenda that shifts attention to the actual practices through which ordinary people engage and enact  and often ignore and deflect  nationhood and nationalism in the varied contexts of their everyday lives.  We begin by developing our interest in the everyday contents of the nation:  what the nation means to ordinary people.  Next, we turn to an elaboration of the everyday contexts of the nation:  when the nation matters to ordinary people.  The nation does not resonate evenly across time and space; rather it comes to matter in particular ways to different people at specific junctures.  We call for the empirically grounded investigation of the ways nationhood is reproduced not in response to political imperatives, but according to the contingencies of everyday life."
0,"Recent research on African American media representations describes a trend of progressive, antiracist film production. Specifically, ""magical negro"" films (cinema highlighting lower-class, uneducated, and magical black characters who transform disheveled, uncultured, or broken white characters into competent people) have garnered both popular and critical acclaim. I build upon such evidence as a cause for both celebration and alarm. I first examine how notions of historical racism in cinema inform our comprehension of racial representations today. These understandings create an interpretive environment whereby magical black characters are relationally constructed as both positive and progressive. I then advance a production of culture approach that examines 26 films that resonate with mainstream audiences' understanding of race relations and racialized fantasies. I find that these films constitute ""cinethetic racism""-a synthesis of overt manifestations of racial cooperation and egalitarianism with latent expressions of white normativity and anti-black stereotypes. ""Magical negro"" films thus function to marginalize black agency, empower normalized and hegemonic forms of whiteness, and glorify powerful black characters in so long as they are placed in racially subservient positions. The narratives of these films thereby subversively reaffirm the racial status quo and relations of domination by echoing the changing and mystified forms of contemporary racism rather than serving as evidence of racial progress or a decline in the significance of race."
0,"This paper examines three welfare rights campaigns involving SEIU and community organizations that occurred in Los Angeles in the wake of the implementation of neoliberal restructuring of welfare and social services, which illustrate various forms of labor-community collaboration. The first was a campaign for workfare workers rights that emerged in response to the expansion of welfare-to-work programs. The second was a campaign against efforts to privatize welfare services, while the third was a campaign to expand and protect child care services. While union investments in these welfare rights campaigns were limited, these case studies nevertheless  illustrate the promises of community-labor collaboration in the struggle against neoliberal welfare state restructuring. Each campaign led to policy improvements or halted proposed cutbacks in social services, despite a relatively hostile political climate towards public investments in welfare spending."
0,"This paper integrates identity and rational action frameworks to create a general theory of status achievement.  The theory posits that people participate in groups with shared focal activities (partly) in order to achieve local status.  This behavior is modeled as a trade off, where actors decide to invest effort in a status community according to the utility they expect their relative performance will generate.  This utility takes the form of positive self evaluations which are produced through social interaction; three distinct social psychological mechanisms are modeled:  social comparisons, identity verifications, and social approval.  Agent based simulation provides exploration of implications of the model.   The outlines of this simulation model are presented.  Results are discussed.  Status achievement behavior carries important implications for extensions of rational choice models to the explanation of group participation and solidarity."
0,"Youth participation in community and social movements has aroused great research interest recently, but the studies usually focus on the power young people gain through participation, their individual development and the immediate community change.  Regarding social justice as a crucial element of the definition of youth participation, this paper examines the profound social effects of youth movements in historical and cultural contexts.  The importance of student activism in China during the May Fourth period (1915-1919) cannot be stressed too much in Chinese history, as it marked a turning point for the country and established the social norms and the logic of thinking for a Socialist China.  Promoting ideas of science and democracy, the New Culture and the May Fourth Movements are often viewed as patriotic campaigns for social justice.  However, in the popular radicalism of that period, dichotomous thinking took root in the country.  Culture of hatred and destruction was conceived and struggles for democracy eventually evolved into social hierarchy and political hegemony.  A revisit to the so-called success of the movements and their role as the prelude to the Communist China is then necessary.  From the historical analysis, the study demonstrates the necessity to understand and assess youth involvement in democracy via the lens of social development and justice."
0,"This article tests three classical theoretical assumptions about the cause of nationalism. It does so by testing if elite discourse, or internal- and external threats have any impact on nationalist sentiments in Europe. Macro data from various sources is combined with attitudinal data from the International Social Survey Programme 2003 for 21 European countries. Ills concluded that the articulation of nationalism by political elites does not matter. Internal threats in the form of foreign-born population and language fractionalization affect nationalist sentiment negatively, i.e. nationalist sentiments are weaker in more heterogeneous countries. Finally, it is shown that external threats, in the form of loss of territory, have a positive impact on nationalist sentiments: people are more nationalist in countries that have a more recent loss of territory.

0,"This paper examines the work that support personnel do within art worlds and argues that much of the work that they do is invisible.  In particular, this paper draws upon a study of stage managers to see how they describe the work that they do and examine how they make much of their work invisible to others in the theatre world and those outside that world.  The work that stage managers do is invisible because it is framed as non-artistic work. Stage managers create and maintain their invisibility in three distinct ways: they create a physical place where artistic work can be accomplished, they create and maintain a psychological barrier between the art world and the mundane world, and they maintain someone elses artistic ideas even when they have complete power over a show."
0,"Steven Nock argued that love understood narrowly in terms of emotional and sexual intimacy-was a flimsy foundation for relationships and that the institution of marriage provided a firmer footing for stable, high-quality relationships than love alone. Relying on data from the Marriage Matters Survey of 1414 married men and women in Louisiana (1998-2004), we extended Nock's insights to consider whether contemporary marriages organized along institutional lines enjoyed more stability, satisfaction, and less conflict than marriages organized around a soulmate model. Largely consistent with Nock's perspective, we found that individuals who embraced norms of marital permanency and gender specialization and were embedded in social networks and religious institutions enjoyed high-quality stable marriages, so long as they also focused on the expressive dimension of married life. By contrast, spouses who embraced a soulmate model of marriage experienced high levels of satisfaction but also experienced high levels of conflict and divorce. Finally, spouses who embraced traditional norms about marriage without the benefit of social support for those norms reported low levels of marital quality. "
0,"This paper explores US welfare policy and the “culture of poverty.” Through interviews with welfare recipients and public service employees, I examine the experiences of low-income women in Knox County, Ohio.  Further, through participant observation in a poverty simulation exercise for government employees who work with low income clients, I examine the ways opinions of welfare recipients are formed, both historically and in current discourse.  Further, I discuss current welfare policies, and the ways in which they build upon “culture of poverty” ideas to control the reproduction of poor women in the US."
0,"Mobility effects have long been objects of attention in social stratification studies. Researchers have been interested in the independent impact of mobility process in addition to the additive effects of origin and destination. Several models have been proposed to estimate the mobility effects on a host of dependent variables. This paper proposes a new analytical method - Consecutive Trend Model  to explore mobility effects and to yield a unique set of trend estimates along the respective dimensions of origin, destination, and mobility. We report empirical analyses of applications of this model to OCG-I (1962 Occupational Changes in a Generation survey) fertility data. Parameters estimates from the model yield information that has not been obtained in previous studies. Consecutive trend model may well provide a useful tool for mobility effects studies, and it also suggests fruitful avenues for comparative studies across societal and temporal settings that future research might pursue."
0,"This project looks at one intervention typically used by major employers to improve intergroup relations in diverse work environments.  Specifically, it describes the impact of diversity training seminars on worker attitudes. The analysis of a data from over 2000 seminar participants indicates a paradox.  Training did increase awareness on several dimensions but it also may have increased the salience of racial and gender differences."
0,"This paper explores the relationship between sport participation and adolescents alcohol and substance use in the context of other peer activities. Focusing on sport participation we analyze data from a nationally representative sample of Icelandic adolescents, exploring the variation in the use of alcohol and illegal drugs between three different types of adolescents subcultures taking both the family and the school context into consideration. The findings show that alcohol and substance use varies significantly between peer groups, based on what kind of leisure patterns they engage in. More importantly,  the findings show that adolescent engaging in sports are less likely to use alcohol and drugs even if they come in contact with alcohol and drug using peers. The findings suggest that it is important to understand adolescents sport in the context of other peer leisure activities that define the modern adolescent society."
0,"This study investigates how time exposure, measured as the length of residence, and neighborhood exposure, measured as the proportion of people who are foreign-born, affect the likelihood of volunteering among the children of immigrants. The data source is a sample of children from the immigrant families in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Multilevel logistic regression produces segmented assimilation paths for children living in wealthy neighborhoods and deprived neighborhoods. The moderation effect of neighborhood exposure on the length of residence exists only in wealthy neighborhoods during adolescence. This implies that as the proportion of foreign-born people living in the same neighborhood increases, the initial positive effect of time exposure on volunteering lessens and becomes negative when this concentration becomes high enough. Analysis also shows that the pattern observed during adolescence for economically advantaged neighborhoods remains once the children of immigrants have become young adults. These findings shed new light on segmented assimilation theory: that is, in economically advantaged neighborhoods, the lack of exposure to native-born people may indeed slow down assimilation."
0,"In this article we methodologically assess the paradox posited by other researchers of fertility: namely, why fertility is so much lower in the familialistic countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. We examine the relationship between individual attributes, aggregate female labor force participation, child care enrollment, family leave, and individual fertility in 20 developed countries using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our results indicate that women's full-time employment and country-level employment rates decrease expected fertility in contrast to recent research which shows a reversal in the negative association between total fertility rates and female labor force participation during the 1980s. However, the positive association between child care enrollment and fertility indicates that child care services might mitigate some of the decline in fertility, possibly by reducing labor force exit among women with young children.

0,"While I am a friend of the motivating power of romanticizing food and farming, I worry that, as currently articulated, we miss the significance of everything in between for ecology, economic, and equity.  When we try to find some words to organize our understanding of the tussle and hustle of what we sometimes call the “food system,” the first two words that pop into mind are generally the “producers” and the “consumers.”  This polarization is in part due to where we place cultural value, which is with farming and with food.  The “in-betweenness” of food and farming shows up on our cultural radar generally as a villain: “the middleman.”  So we are concerned, increasingly, about farmers and eaters, often with progressive emphases as in the growing literature on farm workers and the nutritional status of the poor.  But hardly anyone is talking about the unglamorous life of the food worker at the coffee counter or in the meat-packing plant.  I offer a new word, “conducers,” and its cognate “conduction,” to highlight the lives of those in between, and consider the prospects for romanticizing their lives so we are equally committed to their ecological, economic, and social conditions."
0,"This paper investigates the impact that educational institutions and family memory have on Mexican Americans racial identity formation.  Based on original research, I use interviews with twenty-nine three-generation Mexican American families in California (sixty-seven total interviews) to answer the questions:  how does the educational system treat second and third generation Mexican Americans?  How does this treatment influence what it means to be Mexican American?  How do parents experiences with school shape their ideologies and practices regarding their childrens education?  Using a family-oriented racial-generational approach, I seriously investigate the linkages between the first (immigrant), second, and third generations.  I make three inter-related arguments.  First, educational institutions discriminate according to race in a manner befitting the particular historical moment (Jim Crow style segregation in the second generation and institutional discrimination in the third generation).  Second, I document how family beliefs and practices concerning education are transferred inter-generationally in a family.  Finally, I suggest that each generation crafts its own racial identity strategy that is born of the twin influences of family history and historical moment.  Highlighting the experiential level, I demonstrate how the significant sociological concepts of race, identity, and culture are created through the institutions of family and society, in conjunction with historical social movements."
0,"Much has been written on ethnic and racial intermarriage, but little research is available on the social consequences of intermarriage. Are the children of mixed marriages more strongly connected to the majority, or are they incorporated in the ethnic or racial minority group? To answer this question, this article uses a minority survey from the Netherlands with data collected from both parents and children. The focus is on Antilleans and Surinamese and children of marriages in which both spouses are black are compared to children of marriages in which one spouse is white and one spouse is black. The analyses provide strong support for the integrative effects of intermarriage on children. These effects are not conditional on the socioeconomic status of the parents. Moreover, the effect on children can be explained in terms of the more diverse meeting opportunities that parents in a mixed marriage provide to their children."
0,"This paper explores a dimension of intergenerational conflict among children of Korean immigrants in the U.S. In the classical immigrant story, intergenerational conflict stems from differences of culture experienced by parents and their children. In particular, this culture gap has been reported greater in Asian immigrant homes. Is the a preventive factor of the generational culture gap? Using 151 survey questionnaires administered in 2003 to grown children of Korean immigrants who lived in the following states: California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, this paper tests whether or not ethnic cultural continuity is a preventive factor of parent-child conflict in Korean immigrant homes. The result shows that there is a strong connection between the maintenance of ethnic culture and the diminished level of intergenerational conflict. This suggests that young adult Korean Americans who have built ties to ethnic experience are unlikely to develop a serious level of parent-child conflict."
0,"This study examines how interpersonal recruitment affects participation in demanding forms of political activity. Previous studies have argued that interpersonal recruitment causally affects participation. However, recruitment attempts are selectively targeted toward people with high participation potential. This implies that interpersonal recruitment may work simply because recruiters ask the people who would participate anyway. Using propensity score matching, I show that interpersonal recruitment has larger effects on non-electoral forms of participation than electoral ones such as campaign volunteer activity. I find little evidence that personal contact increases campaign donation. I also demonstrate that the effect of recruitment is not constant across individuals but varies by the propensity of being a recruitment target. ironically, people who have less chance of receiving requests are more likely to be affected. I discuss the implications of these findings for declining and increasingly unequal political participation. "
0,"Using a nationally representative dataset (Taiwan Education Panel Survey, TEPS), this study examined the relationship between adolescents’ academic achievement and happiness with reference to the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE). This study argues that the happiness of adolescents is influenced not only by their academic achievement, but also by the average achievement at their school. The final sample comprised 11,609 adolescents in the twelfth grade. Results from ordered logistic multilevel models verify the positive effect of individual academic achievement on happiness. However, the positive effect of individual academic achievement on happiness became weaker as the school’s average achievement increased. This study contributes to the literature on social comparison and happiness using Taiwanese samples. Researchers should seek in the future to replicate the results in this study by analyzing samples in different grades or countries."
0,"This article examines the relationship between social networks and organizational commitment in a globalized workplace. The authors find not only that organizational commitment is affected by the network properties of size, power connection, and national/ethnic composition but also that these network effects are contingent upon whether the content conveyed in the relationship is instrumental or expressive. Results demonstrate that organizational commitment is (1) positively associated with network size in instrumental ties but not in expressive ties, (2) positively associated with the power of network partners in instrumental ties but less so in expressive ties, and (3) positively associated with national/ethnic diversity in expressive ties but not in instrumental ties. Findings highlight the relational foundation of organizational commitment and suggest that social networks of employees, contingent upon specific content, present different opportunities to their level of commitment to the organization."
0,"Studies of religion public roles typically concern the ways in which religious frameworks justify opinions and actions. This article draws from participant-observation research to show how people also use religion to define the boundaries of group identities and relationships. Importantly, people do this in situation-specific ways that we cannot predict from people religious reasons for public actions. Evidence comes from two religiously-based organizations sponsored by the same local religious coalition, studied during 1998 to 2000 in a midsized US. city. One group is an alliance of lay people representing different churches, who organized volunteering and community development projects with a low-income minority neighborhood. The other is an alliance of clergy, representing different churches, that organized public events against racism. In each case, group members used religious terms to argue sharply over civic identity despite sharing the same religious reasons for their goals. Resolving the disputes required redefining or reemphasizing the boundaries of collective identity. The dynamics highlighted in my analyses provide new ways of understanding how people use religion to include or exclude others in civic relationships. Even more broadly, they reveal how religion can enhance or impede collaboration across social status and religious divides."

0,"Social scientists have long suspected that friendship dyads are not always reciprocated and those that are reciprocated are likely to be more intimate. Close friendships may provide youth with an environment conducive to healthy development and educational outcomes. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative dataset of youth, we examine how attributes of respondents and their friends affect the odds of reciprocity between adolescents. Asian Americans and females are the most likely to have reciprocated friendships. Interracial friendships are less likely to be reciprocated than intraracial friendships. Further, adolescents with reciprocated friendships report higher levels of school belonging. Finally, reciprocity and school belonging both exert independent effects on academic performance. Friendship reciprocity is an important indicator of social support above and beyond the numbers of friends reported by youth. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Generalized trust in other Americans has never been so low. Explanations of this decline draw attention to the role of generational replacement and to period effects stemming from macro-level economic and political changes. In this paper, I consider generational and period trends in trust for black and for white Americans. Although race is considered one of the most important predictors of levels of trust, few studies have analyzed how race relates to larger generational and period trends of decline. General Social Survey data is used to test whether the decline thesis applies equally to black and to white Americans' trust levels. I consider both the widely used index of generalized trust and the individual items comprising this index. The results show that although the war baby generation (1935-1944) of white Americans was more trusting than other generations, there has been no corresponding variability across generations for black Americans. At the period level, while there has been a decline in generalized trust and each of its sub-components for white Americans, the period-based trends for black Americans are more variable across measures. The use of a general index to study trends for black Americans masks important period-based trends. The decline in trust is related to race and what is missing from most accounts of the race gap in trust is a discussion of structural forces that advantage white Americans and hence inflate their trust levels.

0,"Using three waves of panel data from 7,800 infants in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), the current study compares cognitive abilities of East Asian American children with those in six other racial/ethnic groups at the ages of nine months, two years, and four years. At the age of nine months, East Asian American infants score slightly lower than their peers in most other racial/ethnic groups, after demographic and socioeconomic factors are held constant. East Asian American children clearly make greater cognitive progress than their peers in all other non-European American groups between the ages of nine months and two years. By age four, East Asian American children outperform their peers in all other racial/ethnic groups in math and literacy tests by a large margin. The analyses also find that much of the cognitive advantages of East Asian Americans at the ages of two and four are explained by differences in parental resources."
0,"The phenomenon popularly referred to as helicopter parenting refers to an overinvolvement of parents in their children's lives. This concept has typically been used to describe parents of college-aged young adults. Despite much anecdotal evidence, little is known about its existence and consequences from an empirical perspective. Using a sample of college students at a university in the United States (N=317), the exploration and measurement of this concept is examined. Results of factor analysis of helicopter parenting items constructed for this study support the use of the scale. Results suggest helicopter parenting is negatively related to psychological well-being and positively related to prescription medication use for anxiety/depression and the recreational consumption of pain pills."
0,"Convention wisdom holds that contemporary families are more egalitarian now because wives are working more and fathers are more involved in children's lives.  But, the empirical evidence supporting this proposition often fails to accurately measure relative commitments to work and family roles.  This paper contends that egalitarianism in family life should be assessed by gender similarity in responses to situations when parental obligations conflict with work efforts.  Drawing from two national surveys conducted in 1997 and 2002, this study examined which working partner missed work to attend to children's needs in a sample of dual-earner parents.  The results showed that in pooled models with extensive familial and job-related controls, gender was the strongest determinant of providing urgent child care.  In gender-stratified models, familial factors (especially spouse's work hours) exceeded job-related factors in determining women's sole provision of urgent child care.  These findings suggest more persistent traditionalism than progress toward egalitarianism in work-family role performance.  The implication of these results for future research was briefly discussed"
0,"Limited research has examined how family environments are associated with the relationship context of first sex, an important indicator of reproductive health risk. We use data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to assess the association between the family environment - parent-parent relationships, parent-adolescent relationships, and family structure - and relationship context of first heterosexual sexual intercourse, distinguishing between the transition to first sex in serious and casual relationships. Twenty-five percent of females and 43% of males who had sex by age 18 did so in a casual relationship. All dimensions of the family environment were linked to the relationship context of first sex. Notably, higher parental monitoring was associated with a reduced risk of transitioning to first sex in a casual relationship versus no sex, and greater family routines were associated with a reduced risk of transitioning to sex in a steady relationship versus having no sex, for males and females. A strong maternal-adolescent relationship was associated with a reduced risk of first sex in a casual relationship but only for males. Additionally, in two-parent families, a strong father-adolescent relationship was associated with reduced risk of transitioning to casual sex, but only for females. Pregnancy and STI prevention programs should work with parents to foster positive parent-adolescent relationships, to become aware of their adolescents' activities and to recognize that parents are important models for adolescent relationship behaviors.

0,"The argument has been made that environmental movement organization should concentrate more effort toward affecting political discourse related to the environment (Burns and LeMoyne 2001).  In this article, we revisit this argument and provide empirical evidence regarding the importance of social movement participation in global discursive processes.  Through utilization of NUD*IST 4 and NVivo software packages, we analyze transcripts of the first annual U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue on industry and sustainable development.  The analysis illustrates that non-state actors, including social movement organizations, play a critical role in the articulation and extension of world models related to the achievement of sustainable development.  Although the actors do not always agree on all dimensions of the models under negotiation, they draw upon a foundation of commonly accepted definitions and goals.  In so doing they facilitate the expansion of models by addressing the concerns of various participating actors.  The results of our examination illustrate that multi-stakeholder processes within global institutions can promote the negotiation of universally accepted solutions to the challenges surrounding sustainable development.  Because processes like the UNCSD dialogues include governments, the global discursive communities that result from such dialogues can directly impact nation-state behavior as well as the direction of policies."
0,"The social and political integration of Muslim immigrants into Western societies is among the most pressing problems of today. Research documents how immigrant communities are increasing v under pressure to assimilate to their ""host"" societies in the face of significant discrimination. In this article, we bring together two literatures-that on immigrants and that on social movement participation-to explore whether Muslim immigrants respond to their societal situation by engaging in collective political action. Although neither literature has given much attention to immigrant collective action, they do provide predictive leverage relative to the influence of grievances, efficacy, identity, emotions, and embeddedness in civil society networks. Our analyses are comprised of three separate but identical studies: a study of Turkish (N = 126) and Moroccan immigrants (N = 80) in the Netherlands and a study of Turkish immigrants (N = 100) in New York. Results suggest that social psychological mechanisms known to affect native citizens' collective action function similarly for immigrants to a great extent, although certain immigrant patterns are indeed unique."
0,"From 1980 to 2000, child labor rates across the world fell by more than a quarter. Much of the explanation for this decrease resides in development processes broadly associated with the demographic transition. Net of these internal dynamics, however, globalization may also have played a role. Previous studies have examined the effect of trade and investment flows on child labor rates. However, the impact of cultural models spread by world polity institutions has yet to be examined. In this study, I argue that international organizations have confronted child labor practices, diffusing a ""labor-to-schooling"" model of child development. Analyzing an unbalanced dataset with 428 observations from 116 states across four waves during the 1980-2000 period, I assess the impact of economic and cultural globalization on a state's child labor rate using random effects tobit models. Net of a country's development experience, I find that foreign investment exerts a small, positive effect on child labor, while international organizations exert a larger negative effect. These results are robust to a number of specifications, including first-difference models that restrict attention to longitudinal variation."
0,"This article examines whether and to what extent transitional justice has emerged in the past decade as a transnational social movement. Bringing together the literature on transitional justice with the literature on transnational collective action, it provides both a preliminary analysis of the nature of the shared identity and coordinated action around transitional justice.  Drawing from an empirical study of actors who mobilize around transitional justice mechanisms and processes, the findings leave open the question as to whether and to what extent transitional justice is a transnational social movement but reveals an increasing level of professionalization in the shared identity and skepticism about the coordinated action. The study suggests that there will be ongoing contestation over what actors mobilizing around transitional justice can and should do to meet their varied and critical goals."
0,"The second half of the 20th century was characterized by debate on the implementation of minorities rights, both in the United States and Western Europe. Poland, like other Central Eastern European states, was not able to participate in this process until the 1990s. Since 1989, one observes a significant and rapid increase in legislation that refers to the protection of minorities rights in Poland. This paper aims to explain the above mentioned increase by examining the impact of the international body of European Union known as the acquis communautaire, which states aspiring to membership in the UE needed to fulfill. On the other hand, anti-discrimination prescriptions, by influencing domestic law, modified the structure of political opportunity, opening new possibilities for action to ethnic groups. While it facilitated the ethnic minorities political mobilization, EU law was not decisive in determining the different ethnic minorities' success in having their demands met. I argue that transnational networks and linkages matter in the different ethnic minorities' success. I will examine the transnational networks in which different ethnic groups are embedded, assuming that they variously empower these groups and allow them to break loose from the constraints imposed by the nation-state in ways that allow them to shape domestic politics from outside the state's boundaries."
0,"While thought of as a hyper-rational free-market solution to wealth management, the field of hedge funds is rooted in a highly institutionalized environment; its very development depended on significant institutional innovation by knowledgeable actors acting as institutional entrepreneurs long before the first organizational form appeared.  The relevant institutions continue to constrain and enable the fields organizational entrepreneurs today.  Nonetheless, there are no studies in the economic sociology and organizational theory literatures regarding this important industry.  This qualitative study seeks to shed light on issues of emergence: how fields of economic activity emerge, who are the relevant institutional and organizational entrepreneurs in such a process, and the consequences of shifting social environments to the organizational entrepreneurs seeking to establish firms in an emerging industry."
0,"This research contributes empirical and theoretical clarity to the sociological study of religious activism in the U.S. during the 20th century The primary objective was to track, describe, and explain the dynamics in ideological orientations and denominational participation of on Christian activist groups. Using a novel method cataloging every Christian activist organization existing in the United States from 1960-2000.  Findings highlight the ideological orientations and religious denominations of groups by proportional size, influence over time, and intra-sectional dynamics, interactions with historical events. Based on these observations, I argue that threat to values or institutions held as “sacred” are the sufficient and recurrent mechanism leading to Christian activist mobilization. This initial mobilization, --motivated by threatened values or institutions -- occurs within a sensitive social system known commonly as the civil sphere, which then frequently produces its own counter-mobilization. My findings indicate that despite the seemingly chaotic flux within the religious activist sector, an approximate balance or unintentional homeostasis between ideologically opposed groups is achieved at the population level at nearly year of measurement.  As a result, I argue that a model of the civil sphere as cybernetic is both fitting and possibly necessary to account for the variety of phenomena observed therein."
0,"This paper uses strategic choice and neo-institutional perspectives to examine how variation arises in the development of both corporate social responsibility-related formal structure and practices. Using a representative sample of Korean organizations, I examine the effects of top managers’ discretion on formalizing and elaborating boundary-spanning structure regarding corporate social responsibility. Also, by using multidimensional model, I can reveal nuances of organizational legitimacy that are missed by more unitary conceptions by identifying two forms of legitimacy: practical, based on normative pressures exerted by professional and business associations and media; and ethical, based on pressures initiated by labor unions and minority employees."
0,"This study describes participants in vocational training programs, determines whether patterns seen in previous research on this population still hold true, and examines gender differences in participation in this type of education.  The research offers the first in-depth examination of vocational education using an important new dataset (scheduled for public release in early 2003): the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Survey of the 2001 National Household Education Surveys program.  The study describes the characteristics of participants and examines their courses of study, commitments of time and money, support from employers, and types of institutions selected for training.  It determines the relationships between these variables and participants characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income, and notes recent changes by comparing current findings to data from the 1990s (see Levesque 2000).  In light of the sharp gender segregation in vocational fields, a focus of the investigation is gender differences in these types of education.  A novel aspect of the present study is a gender comparison of current students likely future incomes based on the occupational preparation provided by different fields of study.  The labor markets for vocational workers are highly gender-segregated.  Fields such as trade and industry are male dominated, while lower-paid fields such as cosmetology are female dominated (Levesque 2000).  The present study demonstrates that the pipeline of future vocational workers remains sharply segregated by sex and that this may have significant consequences for the future of earnings disparities between men and women."
0,"This study evaluates the characteristics of the men who served in the volunteer military in combat occupations. It examines whether these characteristics stem from supply-side or demand-side decisions, or reflect class bias. The findings suggest that, on the supply side, men who had greater academic abilities were more likely to go to college, thereby avoiding military service and the possibility of serving in a combat occupation. On the demand side, the armed forces were more likely to exclude men with lower academic abilities but were more likely to assign such men in the military to combat occupations. Net of the impacts of these supply-side and demand-side decisions, men who served in combat occupations still differed from those who did not in terms of their family background. The impact of family background was stronger on entering the military than on being assigned to combat occupations once in the military."
0,"Objectives. The study was to identify anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation disparities among Chinese Americans and how immigration-related factors affected the outcomes. We tried to explain the differences as a function of the Chinese culture. Methods. Data were derived from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), the first national epidemiological survey of these populations in the United States. We used only the Chinese sample (N=600) and focused on depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and suicidal ideation. Results. The US-born Chinese and those Chinese who immigrated to the United States at or below age of 12 years were at higher risk of mental problems and suicidal ideation than their China born counterparts who arrived in the country at or after 12 years of age. The differences are more notable for women than for men on both lifetime and 12-month measures. Chinese-American women who immigrated to the country at or after 18 years of age had lowest prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Conclusions. For Chinese Americans, immigration-related factors were associated with mental disorders and suicidal ideation. Especially for women, US-born nativity and younger age at time of immigration were strongly related to higher prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. The higher prevalence of mental disorders might be attributed to the psychological strains experienced by those who are at higher risk of cultural conflicts."
0,"This article assesses whether social-ethnic composition influences students' school misconduct. Based on general strain theory, we expect to find that individual sense of futility acts as an intermediate mechanism. Starting from cultural deprivation and oppositional culture theory, however, we hypothesize that a shared school culture of futility acts as mediator. Multilevel analyses of data from the Flemish Educational Assessment, consisting of 11,872 students in 85 schools, showed that ethnic composition has an impact on school misconduct: there is more deviance in ethnically mixed schools than in ethnic concentration schools due to a greater student sense of futility. The presence of a culture of futility did not affect the probability of being deviant. These results were true only for natives: school factors did not affect migrants' deviancy. We conclude that, although a dispersal of ethnically diverse students across all schools is favorable, this can yield negative side effects."
0,"Using geo-referenced data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, in conjunction with decennial census data, this research examines metropolitan-area variation in the ability of residentially mobile blacks, Hispanics, and whites to convert their income into two types of neighborhood outcomes neighborhood racial composition and neighborhood socioeconomic status. For destination tract racial composition, we find strong and near-universal support for the ""weak version"" of place stratification theory; relative to whites, the effect of individual income on the percent of the destination tract population that is non-Hispanic while is stronger for blacks and Hispanics, but even the highest earning minority group members move to tracts that are ""less white"" than the tracts that the highest-earning whites move to. In contrast, for moves into neighborhoods characterized by higher levels of average family income, we find substantial heterogeneity across metropolitan areas in minorities' capacity to convert income into neighborhood quality. A slight majority of metropolitan areas evince support for the ""strong version"" of place stratification theory, in which blacks and Hispanics are less able than whites to convert income into neighborhood socioeconomic status. However, a nontrivial number of metropolitan areas also evince support for spatial assimilation theory, where the highest-earning minorities achieve neighborhood parity with the highest-earning whites. Several metropolitan-area characteristics, including residential segregation, racial and ethnic composition, immigrant population size, poverty rates, and municipal fragmentation, emerge as significant predictors of minority-white differences in neighborhood attainment."
0,"Researchers have identified several problems in measuring the strongest path connecting pairs of actors in valued graphs.  To address these problems, it has been proposed that average path value (APV) be used to indicate optimal connections between dyads. However, a lack of a proper computer algorithm and its implementation has hindered a wide-range application of the proposed APV solution. In this paper we develop a computer algorithm and fully implement it with four JAVA programs, which are available on request. These programs produce an optimal connection matrix, which is subsequently input into UCINET for further multidimensional scaling and clustering analysis. We demonstrate this procedure with a data matrix containing 38 organizations in information technology. We discuss the methodological implications of the application of our algorithm to future social network studies."
0,"This article uses updated purchasing power parity measurements of countries' income and a new strategy for approximating global inequality to examine how global income inequality-as a combination of increasing average within-country inequality and decreasing between-country inequality-changed in the period 1980-2005. In view of the overwhelming influence of China and India on trends in global inequality change, the authors base their strategy on estimating the change in world average within-country inequality from change in within-country inequality of these two countries. The authors find that global inequality decreased continuously throughout the period. They also project that global inequality will likely rise again in the next 25 years unless the stellar economic performance of China and India spreads widely to other developing countries."
0,"This paper briefly describes a longitudinal qualitative interview study of children of incarcerated parents and their caregivers. The paper first reviews the emerging quantitative research literature on children of incarcerated parents, noting that it provides good evidence that children are harmed by parental incarceration across a range of indicators (including aggression, mental health, and educational attainment). It then uses qualitative interviews to explore the ways in which incarceration harms children, focusing on socioeconomic consequences and aggression. Finally, the paper concludes with a caution for policy makers, arguing that demonstrating that parental incarceration harms the average child does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that all children would benefit from the continued presence of the incarcerated parent in their lives."
0,"Women who participate in mixed-gender, antifeminist movements are not a homogeneous group of actors who face no identity-based conflicts when they mobilize for these causes. Using 23 in-depth interviews with women involved in the American fathers' rights movement-which has as its goal the reformation of child support and child custody laws in ways that are more favorable to men and less favorable to women-I argue that mixed-gender, antifeminist activism has the potential to produce high levels of tension for female participants between their various social identities and their collective movement identity. Indeed, almost half of these women elaborate on how two particular manifestations of their social identities-as simultaneous members of other feminist groups and simply as women-clash with the collective identity generated by the fathers' rights movement. Ultimately, these women coped with these competing allegiances in a variety of proactive ways. In contrast, the other half of the sample experienced no such tensions. These differential patterns of identity-based conflicts are suggestive of the hazards associated with a social movement's efforts to attract a wider membership base over time."
0,"This article compares marriage patterns by race, education and religion in the United States during the 20th century, using a variety of data sources. The comparative approach allows several general conclusions. First, racial endogamy has declined sharply over the 20th century, but race is still the most powerful division in the marriage market. Second, higher education has little effect on racial endogamy for blacks and whites. Third, the division between Jews and Christians is still strong, but the division between Catholics and Protestants in the marriage market has been relatively weak since the early 1900s. Fourth, educational endogamy has been relatively stable over time."
0,"This paper investigates alternatives to studying the lives of lone mothers through the homogenizing category lone mother. This can be achieved by an analysis which combines the following three critical perspectives on the category: first, understanding the impact that contexts (both material and cultural) have on how lone motherhood is defined and experienced; second, acknowledging how the category lone mother is but one aspect of a womans life in which also other categories such as gender, class and ethnicity intersect and interact; and third, examining the impact that the category lone mother has on the lives of women. These three routes of analysis in combination allow an appreciation of the constraints placed by social inequalities on the lives of lone mothers, while not reducing these multi-dimensional lives to the one-dimensional category lone mother, and could form the basis of less stigmatizing and more effective policies."
0,"Findings from Robert Putnams national Social Capital Benchmark Survey (2007) indicate that race and ethnic diversity reduces social solidarity and social capital among intra-group members. According to Putnams constrict theory, individuals in diverse communities, tend to hunker down and withdraw from members of their own race and neighborhood. Trust, social support, altruism, and community cooperation also decrease. These claims are examined in 99 rural Iowa communities, many of which have recently experienced social, economic, and demographic changes due to restructuring in the meat processing industry, the consolidation of pork and poultry farms into confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), deskilling, and the recruitment of a predominantly Latino immigrant labor force. Combining Census data and data from the Rural Development Initiative (Iowa State) gathered in 1994 and 2004, the effects of increased Latino diversity on measures of social support are analyzed through multiple regression and hierarchical linear modeling. Although initial findings indicate diversity is a small and statistically significant predictor of social capital, greater variance in social support occurs within rather than between communities, challenging the accuracy of generalizations about the effects of diversity. The impact of industry changes at the individual level must be understood and examined in further analysis."
0,"This study examines the link between residential segregation and body mass index among Latinos and Asians in the United States. Individual-level data are from the 1999 to 2008 continuous National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) and neighborhood-level variables including residential segregation measures and socioeconomic status indicators will be constructed using the 2000 U.S. census data. The two data sets will be merged at the census tract level. We have two main hypotheses. First, controlling for race and ethnicity, residential segregation is linked to body mass index differentially for economically deprived neighborhoods compared to affluent neighborhoods such that the injurious effects of residential segregation are stronger in deprived neighborhoods and the effect is weaker or even reversed in affluent neighborhoods for Asian and Latino Americans as a whole. Second, controlling for neighborhood socioeconomic status, the segregation and weight link varies for Asians and Latinos possibly due to different prevalence rate of overweight and obesity, norms toward body weight, and other cultural factors."
0,"The ability to raise equity capital from external sources enabled corporations to achieve unprecedented productivity through massive collectivization in production and intensification of technological innovation. The development of multidivisional structures in the 1920s consolidated the position of the corporation as an organization form. By the 1960s, the modern diversified corporation emerged as the dominant form of wealth creation in the global economy. In spite of the central role of modern corporations in the global economy, conditions of corporate and financial market development are not yet well understood. Our exploration of securities development focuses specifically on the role of bureaucracy as a central determinant of agency costs born by shareholders. We explore the association between bureaucratic performance and corporate development, we first review the literature on legal origin and the development of rational-legal state bureaucracy in the rise of modern capitalism in the West.  We then examine why rationalization of public administration strengthens governments effectiveness in producing, motivating and sustaining institutional elements favorable to the development of modern corporations (Greif 2005). We use the World Bank Governance data set to test our hypothesis positing a positive causal connection between state bureaucratic effectiveness and the development of modern corporations."
0,"This is an ethnographic study of a new media firm located in New York City, referred to as Community.com. Following a period of growth from roughly 1995 to 2000, the new media industry faced a major crisis. Community.com was faced with a decision about how to proceed profitably and survive. This is a study of the organizational response to environmental and institutional pressures which caused many firms in the new media industry to fail. My research strategy connects institutional and organization theory with research on technology. The central research question I am asking in this study is how is technology institutionalized? As the economic environment changed the institutional logic of the new media industry shifted from the community to the market. Community.com adapted to the shifting logics of the industry and survived by incorporating the new logics into work practices and technology. The institutional environment penetrated the organization and affected these elements. This study shows how one firm reacted to and interacted with the changing institutional environment. The central theoretical question of my study is what are the mechanisms at work between the macro, meso and micro levels of the environment, organization, and individual?"
0,"The paper compares the socio-economic attainment of contemporary Chinese immigrants from Australia and the United States.  These two nations, along with Canada, house the largest number of  foreign born Chinese.  The paper uses data from the 1996 Australian census (1 percent CURFs) and from the 2000 US census (5 percent and 1 percent PUMs) to examine four economic outcomes: labor force participation, unemployment, occupational status and income.  Results suggest considerable intra-national differentials, differentials that are similar in both the US and Australia.  Persons from the PRC incur large economic penalties that are rarely explained by their characteristics.  Those from Vietnam incur large gross penalties but more often than not these are due to their characteristics.  On the other hand, persons from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia reap both gross and net advantages.  Finally, looking across the dependent variables, irrespective of birthplace, most Chinese immigrants do relatively better in the US than in Australia."
0,"The general post-Nuremberg principle applied at the Hague at comprehending war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia was one of framing responsibility as a top-down phenomenon and prosecuting the big fish. By contrast, the general principled applied for framing torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo has been one of constructing responsibility as a bottom-up phenomenon or the result of a few bad apples at the bottom of the chain of command. Social and cultural theorists ranging from Durkheim to Foucault, Baudrillard and the postmodernists are used to analyze this sharp contrast in approaching how international crimes of war are framed culturally."
0,"Based on studies showing health advantages for breastfeeding mothers and their infants, pediatricians and other breastfeeding advocates encourage new mothers to breastfeed their babies for at least the first six months of their infants' lives, arguing that breast milk is best for infants, families, and society, and it is cost free. Few empirical studies, however, document how the decision to breastfeed instead of formula-feed is associated with women's post-birth earnings. This is an important omission, given that the majority of women today work for pay, and many work in job environments incompatible with breastfeeding. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, our results show that mothers who breastfeed for six months or longer suffer more severe and more prolonged earnings losses than do mothers who breastfeed for shorter durations or not at all. The larger post-birth drop in earnings for long-duration breastfeeders is due to a larger reduction in labor supply. We discuss the implications of these findings for gender equality at home and at work."
0,"How has growing knowledge about human genetics affected how American textbooks present race? This article analyzes 80 biology textbooks published from 1952 to 2002 to reveal that U. S. biology texts have pursued the topic of race with renewed vigor in recent years. Moreover, textbooks have redefined race as genetic without furnishing empirical evidence for this framing. The textbooks' transformation sheds light on the broader relationship between race and science in the United States, where claims about racial difference have not only drawn instrumentally and selectively from empirical research, but at times forgo scientific grounding altogether. As the textbooks show, both the tight and the loose linkage of race to science can preserve the cultural authority of the race concept. The texts also make clear that race is not a one-time construct or a relic of centuries past. Instead, it is continually remade-and is being reworked today-suggesting its dynamic adaptation for ongoing use as a fundamental tool of social stratification."
0,"Social capital has been alleged to increase the capacity for political mobilization. Yet, until now, the empirical debate has not succeeded in rendering a detailed account of the relationships between social capital and political participation partly because of the use of a reductive conception and operationalization of both concepts. Using a multidimensional and relational technique (multiple correspondence analysis) and a detailed youth survey data from Belgium, the article demonstrates that youth draw on diverse forms of social capital and that these forms vary along socio-economic status and ethnic origin. Six classes based on the forms of social capital were identified. Two of them - the 'Committed' and 'Religious' are highly political active. The 'Committed' Class, based on a diversified social capital, consists mainly of non-immigrant youth with a high socio-economic background undertaking a large diversity of political activities. The 'Religious' Class, based on a narrow social capital built around religious activities, is mostly composed of ethnic minority youth with a low SES involved in more specific political activities.

0,"There has been much research on the powerful functions of political rituals to mobilize people into social movements. This paper studies a neglected topic: the failure of political rituals. Erving Goffmans interaction ritual theory and Randall Collins sociology of emotion provide the theoretical framework for this analysis. By looking at the beginning years of Chinas Cultural Revolution, this paper examines the emotional dynamic of political rituals during that charged time period and posits that forced political rituals can create negative emotions which alienate people from the movement. Since private backstage is important in sustaining peoples performances on a political frontstage, the elimination of the backstage produced even more alienation from the central symbol of their frontstage performance. The negative effects of these political rituals contributed to their disillusionments and the decline of peoples enthusiasm for the Cultural Revolution. Thy have had profound influence in Chinas politics in subsequent years."
0,"In this paper, I explore the popularity of the adult-oriented animated television show, Family Guy, from the standpoint of various cultural theories.  Using data from a thorough analysis of one emblematic episode, along with information on the history of the shows airing, I juxtapose prominent yet underappreciated and often unrelated conceptions of culture and humor, in order to determine how the program reflects key aspects of contemporary life and culture and, in particular, what is unique about the new sort of humor portrayed in this show.  I conclude with a brief discussion of the shows postmodern camp aesthetic and what implications this sort of humor has for an academic explication of popular culture."
0,"The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to ""friend of a friend"" status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many ""generations"" of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily."
0,"We test hypotheses regarding generational differences in the effects on organizational loyalty of workplace insecurity, restructured workplace temporalities, and technological access to the workplace. We argue that large-scale social changes have eroded the social employment contract and impacted these features of the workplace. Further, these new working conditions will have a greater impact on the organizational loyalty and commitment of older cohorts of workers whose expectations were formed under the previous social contract than on more recent cohorts. With the exception of insecurity, our results generally support our hypotheses. They also have some intriguing implications that the conditions that dampen the loyalty of older cohorts enhance that of younger. Likewise, they raise important questions about what factors affect the loyalty of younger generations of workers and what role the increasing reliance on technology for work outside of onormalo working hours might play in fostering loyal employees."
0,"Contradictory views on women’s achievement in the workplace and society depict progress towards equality as inevitable (Jackson, 1998) or inhibited by social and institutional barriers (Lorber, 1994; MacKinnon, 1989). Few institutions have historically presented more defined gender boundaries than the military. Nonetheless, women have made substantial progress over the past forty years, providing support for the likelihood of advances towards greater equality, even in the most traditionally masculine environments. On the other hand, evidence suggests that that substantial progress has slowed in recent years.  The continued formal exclusion of women from branches most likely to lead to career advancement, as well as continued exposure to sexual harassment and assault, are mechanisms that inhibit further progress. Pervasive masculine hegemony (Connell & Messerschmidt, 2005) and the highly gendered nature of the military organization (Britton, 2000; Acker, 1990; Silva, 2008) may provide an explanation for institutional resistance to profound change. Cecilia Ridgeway (2011) attempts a synthesis of these views.  She outlines institutional and other modernizing social forces that enhance women’s progress.  At the same time she recognizes multigenerational patterns of gender framing that act as a break to full inequality.  Using Department of Defense surveys, promotion, harassment and assault data, as well as a literature review of current events, I explore how forces enabling and inhibiting progress co-exist in modern organizations.  This paper provides a nuanced accounting of the likelihood of equality of opportunity and inclusion in traditionally gendered organizations."
0,"Although there has been much progress in the research on the effects of neighborhood and city characteristics on individuals, a key question posited by Marta Tienda (1991) remains largely unaddressed. Tienda asked if the effects of residential setting on individual outcomes are immediate, accumulate over time, or some combination of the two. Using longitudinal data in a multilevel model, this paper examines the effects of additional years of residence on individual odds of employment and how the return to time varies by race, gender, and across different types of cities. The results show that while most people experience an increase in the likelihood of being employed when they spend additional years in a metropolitan area, there is considerable variation as to who benefits most across different types of cities. The notable exception is for black men, who face decreasing odds of employment with each additional year they spend in cities with high levels of economic segregation."
0,"This research examines inter-regional migration patterns in the United States by native-born whites and blacks over the final four decades of the 20(th) century. Our primary research question is whether regional changes in the United States have made the South a more favorable destination than it once was, especially for blacks. Using samples of census data from 1970 to 2000, we analyze white/black differences in primary (an original move) and return migration to the South, as well as in the selectivity of migration. We observe increasing rates of black (compared to white) migration to the South. Additionally, patterns of selectivity within this growing black migration stream suggest that younger, more educated black women are an important component of this regional population shift."
0,Organizational research often focuses on practices or populations of organizations that have become socially or economically important. This implies that researchers often study empirical settings that are unrepresentative of the settings that the theory the researchers are testing is supposed to apply to. We illustrate how such a selective sampling of empirical settings can lead to spurious findings by examining two research areas of organizational studies: diffusion research and research on density dependence in organizational entry and exit rates. Diffusion researchers typically study practices that have diffused widely. We show that this implies that they will underestimate the effect of previous adopters on new adoptions. Researchers in organizational ecology often study populations that have become large. We show that this implies that they will overestimate the effect of density on exit and entry rates. We discuss the implications of such selective sampling of empirical settings for diffusion research and organizational ecology and more generally for the selection of the populations and empirical settings studied in organizational research.
0,"The “Laffer curve,” which suggests that there is a point at which an increase in taxes will cause a decrease in government revenues because higher tax rates will provide a disincentive to earn income, was prominent in supply-side economic rhetoric in the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Politically, the Laffer curve argument contributed to a permanent shift in attitudes toward taxes, and the argument that tax cuts will increase government revenues has remained visible in U.S. politics ever since.  Rhetorically, however, the Laffer curve shifted from being perceived as a novel, legitimate, relatively academic theory, to being a partially discredited symbol of a specific political era, even as the concept it illustrates (tax cuts can increase revenues) has remained politically potent.  This paper examines how use of the term “Laffer curve” evolved from the first time it was mentioned in the Congressional Record, in 1977, through 2009.  By looking closely at the process through which the use of political rhetoric changes over time, we contribute to a conversation about how discursive opportunities facilitate or constrain political action."
0,"Contrary to popular social myths that portray older adults as asexual, many individuals engage in regular sexual activity and maintain a strong interest in sexuality later in life. Yet, both doctors and patients are often reluctant to discuss issues of sexual health. Given that support from one’s spouse is conceptualized and empirically demonstrated as protective factor that promotes healthy behaviors, including regular medical care, this study examines the influence of positive marital quality on attitudes related to openness regarding discussions of sexuality with a doctor. Results from nationally representative data of a sample of adults between the ages of 57 and 85 suggest that higher levels of positive marital quality predict greater comfort discussing sex with a doctor among men as well as greater approval of such discussions among both men and women. These results suggest that many older adults are willing to discuss their sexual health with doctors as well as demonstrate the salient influence that support from a spouse has on assessments of openness to such sexual health conversations, especially among men."
0,"Conservation professionals, in Tanzania's northern safari circuit, offer widely varied explanations of the epidemiological drivers of the area’s HIV/AIDS epidemic. During semi-structured interviews, elite conservationists routinely positioned causality within the realm of individual behavior and personal irresponsibility. However, overwhelmingly, mid and low level conservation professionals collectively argued that individual behaviors cannot be understood without being contextualized vis-à-vis four primary structural forces: 1) the development which accompanies conservation and tourism in the region, 2) the relative economic inequality which results from this development, 3) a social milieu of patriarchy and gender inequality which both precedes and is reinforced by such dynamics, and 4) social geographies of migration and isolation. To examine how it is that what may at first glance appear a seemingly homogeneous social group, conservation professionals, can mobilize such divergent perspectives on the drivers of HIV/AIDS, I draw on insight from feminist standpoint theory, coupled with Garland’s conceptualization of performative Tanzanian conservation subjectivities (2006). This framework provides an analytic frame through which to examine why those with the most professional status, class privilege and highest levels of education are also the most likely to attribute the spread of HIV/AIDS to individual behavior and shortcomings. It also demonstrates how occupationally grounded social standpoint, informed by educational and professional status, shapes how conservation professionals perceive the drivers of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and enables us to make sense of how embodied social position, mediated by structural forces, help shape understandings of HIV/AIDS."
0,"A striking feature of modern societies is the extent to which individual persons are culturally validated as equal and empowered actors. The expansion of a wide range of rights in recent decades, given prominence in current discussions of world society, supports an expanded conception of the individual. We examine the extent to which broad global changes promoting human empowerment are associated with expanded ideas of the status and capacities of students. We hypothesize that there are substantial increases in student-centered educational foci in countries around the world. First, the rights of students as children are directly asserted. Second, an emphasis on empowered human agency supports forms of socialization that promote active participation as well as the capacities and interests of the student. Examining a unique dataset of 533 secondary school social science textbooks from 74 countries published over the past 40 years, we find that textbooks have indeed become more student-centered, and that this shift is associated with the rising status of individuals and children in global human rights treaties and organizations. Student-centered texts are more common in countries with greater individualism embodied in political and socio-economic institutions and ideologies, and with more links to world society. The study contributes to both political and educational sociology, examining how global changes lead to increased emphasis on empowered individual agency in intended curricula."
0,"World polity research argues that modern states are shaped by embeddedness in a network of international organizations, and yet the structure of that network is rarely examined. This is surprising, given that world polity theory implies that the world polity should be an increasingly dense, even, flat field of association. This article describes the social structure of the world polity, using network analysis of the complete population of intergovernmental organizations as it has evolved since 1820. Analysis of the world polity's structure reveals growing fragmentation, driven by exclusive rather than universalist intergovernmental organizations. The world polity has thus grown less cohesive, more fragmented, more heterogeneous, and less ""small worldly"" in its structure. This structure reflects a recent rise in the regionalization of the world polity."
0,"Public opinion polarization is here conceived as a process of alignment along multiple lines of potential disagreement and measured as growing constraint in individuals' preferences. Using NES data from 1972 to 2004, the authors model trends in issue partisanship the correlation of issue attitudes with party identification-and issue alignment-the correlation between pairs of issues-and find a substantive increase in issue partisanship, but little evidence of issue alignment. The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs. The authors discuss the consequences of partisan realignment and group sorting on the political process and potential deviations from the classic pluralistic account of American politics."
0,"The postwar era saw an explosion in sport broadcasting. Acting to stabilize its position, the NCAA limited the number of broadcasts per season. To win support, the NCAA tapped into Cold War anxieties of an effeminized masculinity that college football could remedy. Doing so kept college football from following minor league baseball down the path to sport oblivion in the television age. In constructing this history, I theorize college football broadcasting as the cultural commodity of a broad coalition of forces that I call a sport/media matrix, which includes sport, higher education, media, the military, advertising and public relations, and economics."
0,"It has been five years since the government separated prescription and dispensation of drugs on July 1, 2000.   Has the System made a success or failed?  It is not important now whether the period of 5 years is enough to make any conclusion.  Evaluation on the System is inconsistent among Korean Institute for Health and Social Affairs, academic worlds, and civil groups.  In fact, it is the natural result.  The System has an aspect of ""culture"" with which not only the people but also the concerned authorities are related, in that it changes the existing behaviors related with prescription of drugs, and in order for the System to have reasonable results and influences to the full, we will have to wait some more time.  If a system, a policy and its operation have an aspect of culture, it is no doubt that understanding and participation of the concerned authorities is important for success of the system and policy.  However, unfortunately, the situation is not so good and in this respect, it can be said that separation of prescription and dispensation of drugs is in progress.   It is necessary and natural to evaluate the System by period, but the general and objective evaluation on the System can be possibly made after all the transient problems are solved.  Therefore, evaluation in this paper is temporary, but it is inevitable too which is necessary to cope with the problems in question."
0,"This article examines the discourses of Israeli right-wing figures who opposed Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip in August 2005. Relying on a systematic analysis of prominent conservative Israeli outlets, the author demonstrates an attempt to reconcile two opposing discourses: a particularistic-Jewish morality discourse and a universal rhetoric of human rights. The author shows that the use of the latter is a relatively novel phenomenon, which was absent during the struggle against Israel's retreat from the Sinai Peninsula in April 1982. Drawing on these findings and on larger global tendencies, the author offers that during the last few decades, human rights rhetoric has become politically instrumental, maybe even unavoidable, for groups and individuals who traditionally have not used it."
0,"Research collaboration in modern science is ubiquitous across disciplines, though until relatively recently, this was not the case.  This paper describes how and when the change in this scientific norm occurred.  Publishing records from an interdisciplinary sample of research scientists (n=344) reveal substantial differences in rates of collaboration associated with the time of scientists PhD training.  Earlier trained scientists collaborate significantly less than more recently trained scientists, a difference particularly visible in the earliest careers years.  Statistical models indicate that controlling for gender, status and discipline, scientists trained in the 1950s collaborated almost 40% less on early career publications than did scientists trained in the 1990s.  Findings suggest both cohort and period effects may be operating to produce this shift in collaboration trends."
0,"Prom magazines aimed at adolescent girls construct the high school prom as a perfect event that girls must invest in heavily in order to have a good time. Both advertisements and editorial content repeatedly use the word perfect to describe the necessary preparations, dress, male date, and evening. But the realities of the prom are very far from perfect. Girls attending the prom recognize the discrepancy between what the magazines are about and what the prom is really like. Thus, girls are not cultural dupes; they do not blindly follow all of the edicts of the prom magazines. But they also do not act with complete agency or resistancethey weigh the benefits and negatives of certain attire and action and make decisions that often fall within the guidelines of cultural norms."
0,"We used ECLS-K data for White first graders in 1999 to quantitatively test Lareau's [Lareau, Annette, 2003. Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life. University of California Press, Berkeley] theory of the role played by parental concerted Cultivation as a mediator of the positive effect of parental SES on children's school achievement. We measured concerted cultivation using a scale of 29 items, each of which was a parental response to one of the following: perceptions of parental responsibilities towards their child, leisure time activities scheduled for the child, parental relationships with the child's school, and the number of children's books at home. We also included measures of parental educational expectations, the teacher's judgment of the student's school-related effort and organization, and socio-demographic control variables. We used two distinct measures of achievement-reading test scores, and the teacher's judgment of the student's language and literacy skills. In support of Lareau's theory, we found that parental SES is positively and very strongly associated with concerted Cultivation. We also found that concerted cultivation is positively associated with both test scores and the teacher's judgment of student language and literacy skills, and explains a portion of the effect of parental SES on these achievement measures. However, the portion attributable to concerted Cultivation is modest in size. "
0,"Scholars have long argued that civic organizations play a vital role in developing members' civic capacity. Yet few empirical studies examine how and the extent to which civic skills transfer across distinct and separate civic contexts. Focusing on Latino immigrant members of a Los Angeles janitors' labor union, this article fills a void by investigating union members' involvement in an independent civic arena-their children's schools. Analyses of random sample survey and semi-structured interview data demonstrate that labor union experience does not simply lead to more civic engagement, as previous research might suggest. Rather, conceptual distinctions must be made between active and inactive union members and between different types of civic engagement. Results show that active union members are not particularly involved in plug-in types of involvement, which are typically defined and dictated by school personnel. Instead, active union members tend to become involved in critical forms of engagement that allow them to voice their interests and exercise leadership. Furthermore, findings suggest that the problem solving, advocacy, and organizing skills acquired through union participation do not uniformly influence members' civic engagement. Experience in a social movement union serves as a catalyst for civic engagement for some, while it enhances the leadership capacity of others."
0,"This article investigates how changes in educational assortative mating affected the growth in earnings inequality among households in the United States between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The authors find that these changes had a small, negative effect on inequality: there would have been more inequality in earnings in the early 2000s if educational assortative mating patterns had remained as they were in the 1970s. Given the educational distribution of men and women in the United States, educational assortative mating can have only a weak impact on inequality, and educational sorting among partners is a poor proxy for sorting on earnings."
0,"Previous research suggests that when there is a high level of inequality, there is a low rate of participation. Two arguments are generally offered: First, inequality depresses participation because people from different status groups have fewer opportunities to share common goals. Second, people may participate more in civic and social life when they have more resources. However: until now, these explanations have not been separated empirically. Using EU-SILC data for 24 European countries, we analyze how income inequality is related to civic and social participation. Our results indicate that the main effects of inequality manifest via resources at the individual and societal level. However, independent of these resources, higher inequality is associated with lower civic participation. Furthermore, inequality magnifies the relationship between income and participation. This finding is in line with the view that inter-individual processes explain why inequality diminishes participation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"The role of culture in persistent political divisions within the United States is explored.  Specifically, the possible impact of partisan context on population change is tested using OLS regression and binary logistic regression.  To carry this out two new analytic frameworks are presented: 1) The DRM typology of partisanship, 2) Scenes Performance Scores as quantitative cultural measures.  Results indicate weak but broad support for the thesis that population change is associated with partisanship, and that culture also plays a role in the same process.  Further work is necessary to confirm these results and test more specific relationships between culture and partisanship."
0,"Newly-funded initiatives aim to promote marriage among low-income African American women to reduce poverty and welfare dependency. Research indicates that these women have a strong desire to marry, but lack economically secure marriage partners. This research predominantly focuses on urban populations, and little is known about marriage as a strategy to end poverty and welfare dependency among the rural poor. Two case study counties in rural Mississippi were selected to examine if marriage promotion initiatives are a viable strategy for poor rural African American single mothers. Data were collected through semistructured interviews using a life history calendar procedure. The results show that, like their urban counterparts, poor rural single mothers are rarely able to find their ""Mr. Right"" because of their personal and contextual characteristics."
0,"Organizational and environmental sociology contain surprisingly few studies of the corporation as one of the sources of environmental pollution. To fill this gap, we focus on the parent company as the unit of analysis and elaborate environmental theories that focus on the organizational and political-legal causes of pollution. Using a compiled longitudinal dataset of corporations in Standard & Poor's 500 from 1994 through 2001, we test hypotheses derived from an organizational political economy framework. We find that corporations with more complex structures, greater capital dependence and those headquartered in a state with lower environmental standards have higher pollution rates. In addition, the dollar amount of penalties did not curb pollution rates during this period of weakened federal environmental protection."
0,"In the 1990s, the United States underwent some major reforms in the social and health policies helping needy families and their children.  The most widely discussed of the Federal changes in welfare policies was implemented under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (henceforth, PRWORA). However, during the 1990s there were many other new policy changes that have equally significant implications to needy families and their children. While there were many studies that explored the relationships between the changes in various policies helping needy families with children in late 1990s, few studies with appropriate data provided a comprehensive and up-to-date picture for how the changes in policies are related to each other since the PRWORA. Using the state level data between 1994 and 2002 for ten policy programs, this research would like to help answer, at the state level, how the declines in the average benefits and inclusions of the AFDC/TANF programs were related to changes in benefits and inclusions of the other nine policies helping needy families with children between 1994 and 2002. By using Latent Growth Curve Models, the results show half of the hypotheses based on previous studies on related issues have to be updated."
0,"Do family policies influence attitudes and behavior or are they merely reflections of preexisting attitudes? We consider the implementation of the Norwegian daddy quota, 4 weeks of parental leave reserved for the father, as a natural experiment, and examine the long-run causal effects on attitudes toward gender equality, on conflicts and sharing of household labor, and on support for public childcare. We find that respondents who had their last born child just after the reform report an 11% lower level of conflicts over household division of labor and that they are 50% more likely to equally divide the task of washing clothes than respondents who had their last child just before the reform.

0,"Between 1980 and 2000, residential segregation between non-Hispanic whites and blacks, as measured by the index of dissimilarity, declined by 8.7 percentage points. How this decline reflects stable racial integration at the neighborhood level remains to be seen. Using the Neighborhood Change Database, which provides 1980, 1990, and 2000 census-tract level data in 2000 boundaries, the descriptive analyses conducted here reveal three findings. First, the declines found in white-black segregation are due to increases in multiethnic neighborhoods rather than mixed white-and-black neighborhoods. Second, the decline in segregation appears not to be due to the fact that multiethnic neighborhoods are forming and remaining stable over time. Instead it is due to the increase in the number of these neighborhoods at one point in time. Finally, when focusing explicitly on the stability of mixed-race neighborhoods, such neighborhoods are less stable when examined over two decades as compared to one decade. "
0,"Good jobs can generate capabilities that allow employees to avoid tensions between work and family/home. Following the conceptual framework of Amartya Sen, we examine how job-related demands and resources are related to the level of interference, as well as satisfaction with managing work and home in Spanish and German employees, using three different large-scale European surveys: European Quality of Life Survey and two waves of the European Social Survey. The purpose of this encompassing study is to assess robust estimates of how working conditions affect men and women’s capabilities to achieve work-life balance and quality of life. We find that long working hours systematically increase tensions between work and home, as do time pressure, job-related stress and working hard. Job control or autonomy at work, which is hypothesized to expand individuals’ capabilities and agency, tends to increase work-home interference rather than alleviate it. Family responsibilities and household demands do not seem to be relevant to the tensions employees experience at the work-home interface. This also holds true for women, which is a surprising result in view of the “double burden” hypothesis. Employed mothers in Germany and Spain are a select group of women, as combining employment with raising children under the institutional arrangements found in conservative corporatist and conservative familialist states may be particularly problematic. The institutional contexts of Germany and Spain thus curtail women’s ability to reconcile employment and parenthood. However, the mothers (and fathers) who are employed do not experience significantly higher levels of work-family/home tensions than non-parents."
0,"This exploratory paper examines the role of biomedical knowledge and practices in the perpetuation of colonial rule by focusing on the institutional development of biomedicine and public health measures in colonial India. I adopt Michel Foucaults theory of biomedicine as a 'new technology of power' which at the individual level is centrally focused on the human body as an object and target of power, and at the collective level aided political power in controlling populations through public health measures. Following historical literature on colonial India, I argue that introduction of biomedicine in the colonies was as much an administrative necessity as it was a part of a larger project of cultural hegemony and the spread of Western ideas, institutions and practices."
0,"Research has shown that blacks are relatively disadvantaged when compared with whites on a host of sociological indicators including on income, education and occupational status. Recent research has shown blacks are not all equally disadvantaged. In some cases such as in the case of blacks in Queens County, New York, blacks surpass whites in terms of median income, especially foreign-born blacks. Yet, blacks fare worse when compared with whites on indicators of asset ownership. Despite that, some black ethnic groups including those with roots in the Caribbean or from Africa have been shown to have higher rates of home ownership and higher housing values than African-Americans. However, few studies include measures of asset ownership beyond these indicators when assessing the extent to which ethnicity matters for blacks. The present study examines the following research questions: (1) What factors explain variations in the likelihood of ownership and the levels of interest, dividends and rental income owned for blacks? (2) Is ethnicity a significant predictor for black respondents? (3) Does education and occupation matter more for some black ethnic groups than for others? The findings reveal that ethnicity plays a significant role in the acquisition and accumulation of interest, dividends and rental income, but it does not account for all of the variations observed for blacks. The findings shed further light on the complexities associated with understanding wealth inequality and racial and ethnic group variations. "
0,"This research examines the Jamaican Mothers' experience of moving without documentation to the United States, namely to South Florida, in order to unmask the cross-cultural struggles of transnational families.  Two women that have made the journey from Jamaica to South Florida without documentation were interviewed to answer the research question: What hardships do these women face after moving from their native Jamaica to the receiving country of the United States? Grounded Analysis was used in this study, creating an illuminating investigation of transnational familial relations and the hardships of migrant mothers.  These mothers often have false expectations of their receiving country and of their status in receiving communities, and it is shown that these women are often forced to change their views in order to survive."
0,"In this paper, I apply cultural entrepreneurship theory (Lounsbury and Glynn, 2001) to the non-profit sector, in which founders of non-profit organizations, just like founders of for-profit ventures, tell entrepreneurial stories in order to reduce uncertainty, explain their identity to stakeholders, and gain legitimacy and resources.  However, when an organizations purpose is not wealth creation and stakeholders investments have no financial return, the desired outcome of cultural entrepreneurship is decidedly different.  To explore these differences, I examine the entrepreneurial stories told by members of the prototypical health maintenance organization Kaiser Permanente during two new ventures in the organizations life course:  the founding of the public health plan in 1946, and the organizations attempt to diffuse their model of health care financing and treatment in the 1960s and 1970s.  I find that Lounsbury and Glynns propositions about stories emphases on distinctiveness and conformity relative to the legitimacy of the institutional context must be broadened in order to capture the complexities of different types of entrepreneurialism and the different goals of non-profit organizations relative to for-profits.  Extending their model thus would create a more comprehensive theory of entrepreneurial motivations and outcomes."
0,"We employ newly developed methods to disentangle age, period and cohort effects on non-marital fertility ratios from 1972 through 2002 for black and white women ages 20-44 in the United States. We focus on three cohort factors: family structure, school enrollment and the sex ratio. For both blacks and whites, cohorts with less traditional family structures have higher NFRs. Other results differ by race. The impact of school enrollment on NFRs is significantly negative for whites, but significantly positive for blacks. The impact of sex ratio is significantly negative for blacks, but insignificant for whites. If black women and white women had cohort characteristics typical of the other group, age specific NFRs for black women would decline markedly, while those for whites would increase markedly."
0,"Functioning as our “social skin,"" clothing enables the expression of pre-existing identities and the construction of new ones.  Adolescence, in particular, is a time in which youth “struggle with, resist, and try on differing viewpoints and values in attempts to create a sense of self,"" and this complex process can be expected to complicate the well-established association between clothing and identity.  What does girls’ deliberate use of sports clothing reveal about their process of identity construction and re-construction, and to what extent are prevailing conceptual approaches able to account for their actions?  In the research reported here we examine the relationships among age, identity, gender, and athleticism through the study of the particular association between sports clothing appropriation and the identity work of pre-adolescent female soccer players.  Such work is called for in light of the much-discussed increased purchasing power of girls of this age group and because of the steadily rising participation of girls in organized sport, especially soccer.  To address this association, our investigation is guided by two questions:  (1) how do girls use, choose, and modify sports clothing to facilitate role completion and/or identity construction as pre-adolescent athletes in ways that are constrained by their identities?; and, (2) in what ways does age affect girls’ gendered and athletic clothing practices and preferences?"

0,"Using survey data, we offer a specific test of the general claim that character type-specifically, inner-versus other-direction-is a significant factor in the social influence process. Riesman (1950, 1954) defined character not in terms of idiosyncratic psychological processes, but rather as a robust outcome of socialization. We placed respondents on an inner-versus other-direction continuum using a previously developed 36-item scale (the I-O scale). In addition, we asked respondents to provide information bearing on several indicators of social influence in terms of popular musical culture. The results indicate that I-O significantly predicts musical preference controlling for a variety of demographic characteristics."

To determine whether Skocpol et al.’s conclusions are valid, we recreated their data set as best we could. Of their three main substantive findings, two are sustained by the re-analysis; one is not."
0,"Despite popular claims that racism and discrimination are no longer salient issues in contemporary society, racial minorities continue to experience disparate treatment in everyday public interactions. The context of full-service restaurants is one such public setting wherein racial minority patrons, African Americans in particular, encounter racial prejudices and discriminate treatment. To further understand the causes of such discriminate treatment within the restaurant context, this article analyzes primary survey data derived from a community sample of servers (N = 200) to assess the explanatory power of one posited explanationstatistical discrimination. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that while a statistical discrimination framework toward understanding variability in servers discriminatory behaviors should not be disregarded, the frameworks explanatory utility is limited. Servers inferences about the potential profitability of waiting on customers across racial groups explain little of the overall variation in subjects self-reported discriminatory behaviors, thus suggesting that other factors not explored in this research are clearly operating and should be the focus of future inquires."
0,"Sexual coercion has become the subject of intense research as policymakers have come recognize its widespread incidence in the African setting and the perverse short-term and long-term consequences it has for victims. To date however, most research has treated the experience of sexual coercion as involving processes that play out within the personal, household and social network circumstances of individuals, with little attention to structural characteristics of social groups that affect the contexts in which decisions about sexual behavior are made. In this study, I used data from the 2003 Zambia Sexual Behavior Survey, supplemented with data obtained from the UNDP DEVINFO, to examine the influence of structural characteristics of districts on women’s experience of sexual coercion, while controlling for the women’s personal, household and social network characteristics. The results revealed that in Zambia, district-level wage earning opportunities (a measure of level of social disorganization) and gender differences in access to secondary education (a measure of women’s societal level access to resources) influenced women’s risk of sexual coercion, net of the women’s personal, household and social network characteristics. Women’s risk of sexual coercion increased as wage earning opportunities and women’s access to secondary education relative to men’s increased in a district.  I concluded that researchers and policymakers interested in understanding and regulating coercive sex have to pay attention to both structural as well as to personal, household and social network characteristics."
0,"Earlier research has indicated a negative relationship between ethnic diversity and trust. Whereas previous analyses have been carried out at the country, city or neighbourhood level, this paper adds to the literature by analyzing the impact of ethnic diversity on generalized trust in others and out-group trust in the primary school context. The question of the impact of ethnic diversity in school on the trust of schoolchildren is addressed by drawing on a unique survey of children with immigrant and native Danish backgrounds, respectively, in the last three grades of primary school in Denmark. The survey design holds several qualities strengthening the potential for drawing inference about the impact of ethnic diversity in school on trust. The results of the analysis do not confirm the negative relationship between ethnic diversity and trust found in earlier research. In the primary school setting, ethnic diversity does not affect generalized trust and even has a positive impact on out-group trust of native Danish pupils (i.e., their trust in immigrants). "
0,"The aim of this paper is to analyze the role of key actors in a network based social movement that enabled the organization to incorporate diverse participants in terms of occupational, generational and regional background. Although network analysis is becoming one of the tools for understanding social movement (e.g. Diani eds. 2003), there are only a limited number of researches that adapted network theory in the actual case of social movement. This paper, by analyzing both structural and cultural aspect of the movement network, explores the ‘openess’ of Beheiren movement that played an active role in protesting against the Vietnam War from mid 1960s to early 1970s in Japan. Firstly, by using the concept of structural hole (Burt 1992), I have attempted to locate the key norms that led to the expansion of Beheiren network. Then by adapting the concept of cultural hole (Pachuki and Breiger 2010), I have analyzed the social and cultural background of the key actors in terms of occupation, generation and region. Based on these analyses, I conclude that it was the multiple multiplicity of network and contingency of connectivity that created the ‘openness’ of Beheiren movement."

The hypotheses state that pesticide and fertilizer use intensity in less-developed countries are both positively associated with foreign investment dependence in the primary sector. The use of such inputs in agriculture production is known to contribute to a variety of human health and environmental problems. Findings for random effects and static score panel regression analyses of 35 less-developed countries confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the transnational organization and the relative scale of production in different sectors."

We examine ways in which gendering shapes these effects. Empirically, we perform ordered probit, probit, selection-corrected probit and bivariate probit analyses of data from the 1987-1988 and 1992-1994 waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. We find that if wives are discontent with the appreciation they receive for their paid employment, then their husbands' health declines subsequently (n = 644 couples); if husbands are discontent with the fairness of their unpaid household labor, then their wives' health declines subsequently (n = 609 couples).

The authors introduce a multidimensional framework for analyzing the effectiveness of civic associations in terms of public recognition, member engagement, and leader development. Using original surveys of local Sierra Club organizations and leaders, the authors assess prevailing explanations in organization and movement studies alongside a model highlighting leadership and internal organizational practices. Although available resources and favorable contexts matter, the core findings show that associations with more committed activists, that build organizational capacity, that carry out strong programmatic activity, and whose leaders work independently, generate greater effectiveness across outcomes."
0,"This study examines the tendency of individuals to become disillusioned with the qualities that initially attract them to an intimate partner, that is, fatal attractions.  We find evidence of fatal attractions among a sample of 208 adults, with an average age of 36.5 years.  The results demonstrate that this type of partner disenchantment is not limited to relatively young adults in college relationships, and that it can occur in long-term stable marriages and partnerships as well.  We also demonstrate that these types of attractions can be identified by the use of quantitative scales, a method that is apt to be more reliable than previous approaches that rely only on qualitative data.  Regression analyses reveal that, as predicted, fatal attractions are particularly likely when individuals are drawn to extreme partner qualities.  They are less likely when individuals are drawn to partner traits that are seen as similar to those of their own.  Finally, fatal attractions occur in a wide variety of personality dimensions.  An illustration of a fatal attraction includes a woman who was attracted to her husband because of his power and prestigious position, but who now dislikes that he is too much of a Type A personality."
0,"This paper uses ethnographic data from fourteen months of fieldwork done on the emergent transpacific marriage market linking women in Vietnam and Vietnamese men living in diaspora. I contend that while there is an extensive literature on the transnational life of immigrants across the globe, there is very little attention given to the role of masculinity in contemporary transnational cultures. This paper examines the complex transnational dimensions and trajectories of Vietnamese immigrant men and reflects on the ways in which transnational ties are embedded in social meanings of masculinity in their community of origin. I take up the varied ways in which Vietnamese working class immigrant men remake class and masculinity in the context of massive changes in the new global economy, especially in the transitional economy of Vietnam. The analytics of this paper are based on return visits to Vietnam that the men took to meet their wives as well as subsequent trips they took while their wives waited in Vietnam for paper clearance to migrate. Indeed, these are not just moments of meeting their wives-to-be, but are also extraordinary moments of a transnational journey for the men since most of them were immigrants to the West, and had only returned to Vietnam for the first time, some for the sole purpose of marriage, but for others, the first return visit may have prompted a desire for a transpacific marriage. I will show that homeland return visits constitute a defining moment for immigrants and their social relations across transnational social fields. For analytical clarity, I supply narratives of three men to show three different ways in which these men take on, redefine, or challenge meanings of masculinity and social class as they move from the category of refugees to transmigrants through return visits. These three different patterns include how these men achieve masculinity, how they restore masculinity, and how they compare masculinity across transnational social fields."
0,"This article introduces a network model that pictures occupants of robust positions as recipients of diversified support from durably located others and portrays occupants of fragile positions as dependents on tenuously situated others. The model extends Herfindahl's index of concentration by bringing in the recursiveness of Bonacich's method. Using Newcomb's study of a college fraternity, we find empirical support for the contention that fragility reduces future growth in status. Applications of the model to input-output networks among industries in the U.S. economy and to hiring networks among academic departments are also presented. Implications for future research are discussed."

Our analysis did not indicate that article pictures of African American children were ghettoized into certain topics areas, but we did find that African Americans are underrepresented in both ad and article pictures in these magazines.  Black children are also less likely than their White counterparts to be pictured with parents in general, and fathers in particular.  We argue that these results are indicative of the editors attempts to add strategically placed black children and parents in an effort to do diversity. By doing this the magazine editors promote a white vision of multiculturalism, which reinforces the normativity of Whiteness and preserves the marginality of Blackness in the presentation of American family life."
0,"Using the notion of taste to understand organizations in the field of cultural production, this paper introduces the notion of taste performances to denote strategies in this type of organizations. A taste performance is the organizational members talk and practices relating to taste. At the economic pole, the dominating taste performance the professional approach to taste by and large implies repudiating any influence of taste on organizational members work practices. At the cultural pole, the prevailing taste performance balancing taste and market potential underscores that all judgments are subjective, and thus, judgments must be made in light of the experience of having seen vast numbers of films. Still, some judgments are considered better than others. The paper proceeds to highlight the taste management called for by the mounting influence of the economic logic and the taste performance the professional approach to taste. Taste management is here defined as an attempt to control the taste of organizational members, either by the organizational member him or herself or by the organization."

Contrary to received understandings, Bourdieu did in fact offer a theory of colonialism. The theory involves an understanding of colonialism as a racialized system of domination, backed by force, which restructures social relations and creates hybrid cultures. This theory also carries insights on anticolonial revolution, the limits of colonial reform, and the prospects of postcolonial liberation. Bourdieu’s early thinking on colonialism drew upon but extended French colonial studies of the time. It also contains the seeds of his own later concepts like habitus, field, and reflexive sociology while prefiguring trends in more recent colonial and postcolonial studies."
0,"In this paper, I examine the increasing prolific transit between the ideology of human rights and the visual cultural industry. Using popular photographs of Muslim women and men to defend the popular women-rights-as-human-rights mantra, I underscore the sublimated dimensions of flattening women’s experience into the all too seductive binary of us and them. I read the photographic field of Muslim women and men as an allegory for the triumph of modern disciplinary forms of power, whereby the oppressed Muslim woman transformation comes through the form of a companionate, bourgeois ideal of feminine/feminist subjectivity and through an imaginary that rests on her (violence) as erotic. I understand this recent resurgence as a complex signifier of the productive fantasies of transnational capitalism and global sisterhood, both of which imagine global unity while disavowing differential relations of power. A close examination of these visual subjects, all named as Muslim and all of whom have been subject to patriarchal paranoid violence, allows me to explore this crisis of desire and detestation of the feminine, racialized other through the regime of human rights."

The purpose of the investigation is to develop a broad understanding of the importance of race and class across institutions (families, schools, and neighborhoods) in shaping a variety of outcomes. Data for this project come from the NELS and the 1990 and 2000 Censuses. Results indicate that background characteristics with the strongest association are the one most like the outcome variable. For example, young adult income is more associated with family income than with family education. Other findings show that economic outcomes (like income and wages) are heavily influenced by gender other things equal and that the processes involved in creating racially segregated neighborhoods among young adults are largely independent of those creating economically segregated neighborhoods. Finally, family income associates with more outcome variables than other background characteristics."
0,"The aim of this paper is (1) to reflect upon the idea of a sociological canon and (2) to explore the relationship between its making and the rise of the social. Both reflection and exploration are carried out by analyzing two works often portrayed as peripheral to the canon and the dominant discourse on the social: Smiths ""The Theory of Moral Sentiments"" (1759) and Tardes ""Monadologie et sociologie"" (1893). By underlying their centrality for current debates in the social sciences, I seek to demonstrate that they challenge the idea of a disciplinary canon. A key reason is found in how the authors understood one of the disciplines central concepts: The social. I identify a common explanatory mechanism in both works, which provided a thought space for an external metaphor that could be perceived not as religious in nature, but rather as a secular one. It was this new secular space what progressively emerged as the modern notion of society. Smithian sentiments and Tardian monads functioned ultimately as external metaphors that placed the source of individual action outside the self. Although both, sentiments and monads, served as sources of the social, neither Smith nor Tarde located causality on structural forces, but rather on human interdependence and interaction."
0,"Between 1945 and 2005, nation-states around the world revised their criminal laws on sexual activities. This global reform wave-across countries and domains of sexual activity-followed from the reconstitution of world models of society around individuals rather than corporate bodies. During the post-World War II period, this process rearranged the global cultural and organizational underpinnings of sex, eroding world-level support for criminal laws aimed at protecting collective entities-especially the family and the nation-and strengthening world support for laws aimed at protecting individualized persons. To make our case, we use unique cross-national and longitudinal data on the criminal regulation of rape, adultery, sodomy, and child sexual abuse. The data reveal striking counter-directional trends in sex-law reforms, which simultaneously elaborated regulations protecting individuals and dissolved laws protecting collective entities. World-level negative-binomial regression analyses and country-level event-history analyses confirm our main propositions. The findings demonstrate a sweeping revolution in criminal-sex laws, rooted in the intensified global celebration of free-standing personhood."

The convenience stores studied are those run by the transnational incorporations. The project traces the emergence of the idea of convenience in the US, its being remade in Japan, and its reconfiguration in Taiwan. The research will show how the socio-technological infrastructure, the shared assumptions of urban lives, and the people in Taipei collectively contribute to the way in which the idea of convenience configures. The strategic site  convenience stores  situated in the intersection of just-in-time production, retail, service, and everyday routines, provides a way to approach everyday life in late capitalism. Moreover, this study highlights three factors which have been neglected in existing literature on cross-cultural consumption: (1) inconspicuous consumption (2) the embeddedness of consumption in the infrastructures of a society (3) space as an important aspect of the arrangement of consumption. In addition, the focus of this research on Japanized convenience stores in Taipei, an epitome of a highly developed consumer society in East Asia, will highlight the distinctive trajectories of the development of East Asian consumer societies and cities and intra-East Asia relationships."
0,"In the past few years, an explosion of research has occurred, both clinical and social scientific, on breastfeeding and infant nutrition. In 2004, the US Department of Health and Human Services launched a nationwide public health campaign to promote breastfeeding, and numerous academic articles have been published detailing womens experiences with infant feeding. However, the occupation that is situated between the advocates and the patients has been largely overlooked. Lactation consultants constitute the gold standard in this knowledge arena and are trained to own expert knowledge that physicians and nurses lack. Lactation consultants provide an interesting case for exploring issues of an emergent and gendered profession. Support and advice for new mothers has surely always existed, but never was this knowledge codified as expert and separate from the work of midwives, nutritionists, RNs, and doctors. The occupation has professionalized by developing a recognized board examination and by forming a professional organization. The rise of this almost exclusively female profession in the last two decades has implications for professional jurisdiction and for the division of labor in maternal-fetal medicine. This new occupation also alters the setting of the maternal experience in decision-making about infant feeding. The present study is based on interviews with board-certified lactation consultants, to explore what this relatively new profession entails and how it relates to gender, work, and expert knowledge."

Therefore, it is important to have regular, robust, population-based surveillance of physical activity engagement that can be used to develop policy interventions and measure their success. The primary objective of this study is to describe the methods used to quantify the proportion of Canadians engaging in physical activities at the intensities and durations required to either maintain or enhance their health. Results indicate the overall proportion of Canadians meeting maintenance levels of physical activity has increased between 1992 (76.2%), 1998 (77.3%), and 2005 (82.5%), but over the same time the proportion meeting enhancement levels of physical activity has decreased (38.1%, 36.6%, and 30.6%, respectively).

0,"This paper is based on a larger study using qualitative research to explore how immigrants acquire an understanding of race and racism in the United States.  New immigrants assimilate into a countrys dominant culture, and in particular, into its racialized culture.  I argue here that immigrants respond to racial knowledge by often expressing the same type of modern racism expressed by native-born white Americans.  Further, I explore how racial knowledge is expressed in the words of immigrants, often unintentionally.  Finally, I examine how immigrant ideas of open social mobility and U.S. achievement ideologies are intricately connected to their views on race in the United States.  We live in a white racist dominant culture, and for this social system to be reproduced and maintained, new members of society must be taught the dominant ideologies, and then, in the process of becoming members of society, must express these ideologies."

While this wealth of new data offers exciting horizons for sociological research, new methods of analysis are required. How can sociologists systematically incorporate digital text into the sociological tool-kit? In this paper I begin by describing how sociologists have handled text data prior to the digitization of text. Next, I describe recent advancements in computational linguistics and the new computational social science. Derived from these techniques, I offer a simple network-based model for analyzing the similarities between texts and locating the emergent themes contained within text-based corpora. I illustrate these techniques in an analysis of United States’ presidential inaugural speeches. The digitization of texts represents a possible sea change in how we tell socio-cultural and historical stories. I argue that the greatest potential for these techniques rests at the nexus of new computational methods and more traditional forms of text analysis."
0,"Inequalities of gender and race are produced at the interactional level, guided by our ideological beliefs about society and the proper treatment of its members.  As such, race and gender influence psyches and social structures, often becoming a seemingly natural, necessary, or immutable fact of both.  In this paper I examine the discourse of strong Black womanhood, and I maintain that hailing Black women as strong is a guided practice of racialized gender that reduces Black women to a costly second-class citizenship relative to other race-gender groups.   Drawing on Black feminist analyses and an interview study with 58 Black women, I provide examples of how the strength discourse pressures Black women to exhibit an exceptionality, which is used to exclude them from the concern, care, and resources accorded to higher-status race-gender groups.   I conclude the paper with a discussion of the need to ‘undo’ racialized gender in our everyday interactions to make first-class citizenship available to all."
0,"Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) who work in the public and private sectors have similar training and job tasks, but the variations in their job conditions may be related to differences in job satisfaction, group cohesion, and other aspects of their experiences of work.  As privatization, and its reverse, continue to affect the delivery of public health and safety services, a multi-method examination of the differences between public and private EMT jobs highlights the consequences of these processes for workers.  Problems of pay, schedule equity, and job security are among the concerns that EMTs emphasize as they examine the rewards of work in the public sector."
0,"This paper addresses the issue of the possibility of a fundamental change in the decision criteria of those students from the former USSR (specifically Ukraine) who travel to the west to study.  The specific aspect of change considered here in individual time discounts -- the weight people give to the future in making choices -- which is critical to our understanding of people's propensities to invest, save and engage in cooperative social action. The common assumption throughout the literature (in economics, sociology and political science) is that this discount is exogenously determined and fixed. Here, however, we consider the hypothesis that the weight people give to the future in assessing choices today is not culturally determined or fixed, but instead is changeable and a product of social interaction.  Specifically, contrasting a sample of 172 interviews of students who are or have studied in the west against a comparable interview of 324 students currently in Ukraine, we consider the hypothesis that if citizens of former Soviet Union move from their respective countries to the West, time preferences change as a function of the duration of their stay.  A significant difference in time preference is observed, with students in Ukraine exhibiting a greater propensity to discount the future greatly as compared to their ""Western"" counterparts. To clarify the issue of alternative explanations of this difference, an analysis is introduced that allows us to better address the dynamics of time preferences and to explicitly consider whether selection provides a better account than does socialization. Our general conclusion is that although selection accounts for the greater share of differences, length of stay provides a statistically significant account of some of this difference and thus directs us toward a reconsideration of those analyses that assume exogenously fixed time discounting."
0,"America's changing color line is perhaps best expressed in shifting patterns of neighborhood residential segregation-the geographic separation of races. This research evaluates black exceptionalism by using the universe of U.S. blocks from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses to provide a single geographically inclusive national estimate (Theirs H) of black residential segregation from whites and other groups, which can be additively decomposed into its within (e.g., neighborhood segregation within places) and between components (e.g., racial differences between places). The results show that America's blacks are living in blocks that are roughly two-thirds less racially diverse than the U.S. population overall. Nationally, neighborhood segregation processes account for half, or even less, of blacks' segregation from whites, Hispanics and Asians. Declining big-city micro-segregation has been muted by increasing or persistent macro-segregation. Moreover, with growing neighborhood segregation in the suburbs and fringe, America's central cities-the focus of most previous studies-now account for only a minority share of all neighborhood or micro-level segregation between blacks and whites. Evidence of black incorporation or spatial assimilation must account for other levels of geography that extend beyond the traditional focus on neighborhood segregation in big cities."
0,"What makes political life in the United States so different from political life in France, Hungary or Argentina? This paper considers why societies do politics differently. However, in contrast to much previous work, we employ a resolutely inductive analytical logic. We draw on Bourdieu's criticism of substantialist thinking in sociology and on his conceptualization of the social space to argue for a new theoretical and methodological agenda for carrying out comparative research. We do this by exploring and constructing a space of polities based on data from the 2004 World Values Survey, using a variety of relational statistical techniques (e.g., geometric data analysis). The main insight, which we develop at length, is that any single form of political action (e.g., joining a voluntary association, or a demonstration, or a boycott) only takes its meaning in the context of its objective relationship to other political forms that are legitimate within a particular society. We explore the diversity of polity types that actually exist and discuss how they emerge from countries similar configurations of practices. We suggest that the reason for such clustering lies in similar political-historical trajectories. We conclude by arguing for a comparative approach that is sensitive to differences in overall systems of relationships."
0,"This paper uses the case of Chinese migrant lawyers to examine how the spatial mobility of individual law practitioners influences the social structure of the bar. Using data from more than 250 interviews conducted in 12 provinces of China during 2004-2010, the 2009 Chinese Legal Environment Survey, and public sources, the authors argue that the migration of Chinese lawyers from rural areas and rustbelt cities to major urban centers in the east coast in the past decade has profound consequences on the social stratification of the Chinese bar in both the sending and receiving places. The eastbound migration of Chinese lawyers has not only significantly increased the specialization and segmentation of law practice in Beijing and Shanghai, but also intensified the shortage of legal service and the prevalence of unauthorized practice in western and rural China. Based on findings from the Chinese case, the paper connects two major areas of sociological research (i.e., law and migration) and provides a new theory for explaining the social structure of the legal profession."
0,"A rise in the number of women requesting a primary cesarean birth in the absence of clinical indications has been posited as one explanation for rapid increases in cesarean deliveries in the United States.  Known as “maternal request cesareans,” such births are at the forefront of debates surrounding the appropriate use of technology in childbirth.  A number of questions emerge on the existence and acceptability of maternal request cesarean from epidemiological, clinical, and feminist perspectives.  From an epidemiological standpoint, the principal question has become: Is it really happening?  The clinical perspective asks: Is it safe for women and infants?  A feminist debate about the acceptability of elective cesarean questions how such a birth fits within a framework for reproductive justice. These questions remain unanswered and highlight how a discussion of their epistemological origins is largely absent in the debates on patient-elected cesarean birth.  Focusing on the ways in which various kinds of evidence are used to construct the existence and acceptability of maternal request cesarean illustrates how childbearing women are removed from the dialogue and identifies a lack of socially situated knowledge production.  An epistemological reorientation to maternity care research and practice would emphasize outcomes that have physical and social implications for women and infants, investigate how particular methods of birth privilege certain voices and silence others, and offer a sound theoretical basis for a feminist determination on maternal request cesarean."
0,"The Industrial Revolution hit the Midwest between the Civil War and World War I. The same period saw a vast increase in the number of voluntary associations, particularly fraternal orders. I aim to establish that the phenomenal popularity of fraternal orders both reflected and amplified a zeal for the bureaucratic organizational form that helped to propel the Industrial Revolution. In short, fraternal lodges functioned as ‘schools of bureaucracy.’ As part of a larger project comparing white, African-American and immigrant fraternal orders, I will use archival data to investigate how officers in five major white fraternal orders experienced bureaucracy (e.g., a fixed division of labor, hierarchy of offices, formal rules, permanent written files, and rational-legal authority). My project is designed to yield multi-level data on the national organization of these five orders and their particular incarnations in one state and city (Logansport, Indiana). Data will include available historical materials from each order’s archives (e.g., the order’s constitution, rules of the lodge, reports from local lodges to state and national bodies, proceedings of state and national meetings, lists of local lodge officers, and written histories of the lodge or order)."
0,"Desistance from criminal offending has become the source of a considerable amount of research attention. Much of this literature has examined how environmental factors, such as marriage, employment, and delinquent peers contribute to the desistance process. A relatively unexplored possibility, however, is that desistance from criminal behavior is partially due to genetic factors. To test this possibility, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were used to examine the effects that five different genetic polymorphisms (DAT1, DRD2, DRD4, 5HTT, and MAOA) have on desistance from delinquent involvement. Three broad findings emerged. First, marriage significantly increased desistance. Second, some of the genetic polymorphisms had significant independent effects on desistance. Third, for males, the genetic polymorphisms interacted with marital status to predict variation in desistance. The findings underscore the importance of using a biosocial perspective to examine factors related to criminal desistance. "

This paper extends this recent literature by deepening the psychological underpinnings of possible answers to this question in the context of undergraduate grades. Using a rich student-level administrative data set, I explore the effects on performance of both first and last name racial identifiability. I test for the presence of effects from either black or Asian names due to differential teacher expectations (Figlio, 2003), conventional teacher discrimination (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004), or differences in unobserved ability or racial identity that are correlated with name type and directly affect performance (Fryer and Levitt, 2004; Hess and Aura, 2004). A conceptual and empirical distinction is drawn in the paper between unobserved ability effects and racial identity effects. Name type is found to have little direct influence on performance via any channel. Mild evidence suggests that racial identity may be salient in predicting undergraduate grades. The paper contributes to the literatures in social effects, discrimination, and the burgeoning sub-field of economics and identity. "
0,"Complex social systems require knowledge specialists who provide information that political actors rely on to solve policy challenges. Successful advice is unproblematic; more significant is assigning institutional blame in the aftermath of advice considered wrong or harmful, undercutting state security. How do experts, operating within epistemic communities, preserve their reputation in the face of charges of incompetence or malice? Attacks on experts and their sponsors can be an effective form of contentious politics, a wedge to denounce other institutional players. To examine the politics of expertise we analyze the debate in the early 1950s over ""Who Lost China?,"" the congressional attempt to assign responsibility for the fall of the Nationalist regime to the Communists. Using a ""strong case,"" we examine political battles over the motives of Professor Owen Lattimore. For epistemic authority an expert must be defined as qualified (having appropriate credentials), influential (providing consequential information), and innocent (demonstrating epistemic neutrality). We focus on two forms of attack: smears (an oppositional presentation of a set of linked claims) and degradation ceremonies (the institutional awarding of stigma). We differentiate these by the critic's links to systems of power. Smears appear when reputational rivals lack power to make their claims stick, while degradation ceremonies operate through dominance within an institutional setting. Policy experts are awarded provisional credibility, but this access to an autonomous realm of knowledge can be countered by opponents with alternate sources of power. Ultimately expertise involves not only knowledge, but also the presentation of a validated self."
0,"This paper makes two empirical contributions to the literature on the putative effect of voluntary associations on economic activity. First, using a longitudinal database covering the entire United States, we differentiate between the effect of voluntary associations that are connected to other voluntary associations through the multiple membership of their members and voluntary associations that lack these ties. Second, we test for the existence of a conditional effect of the areal size of the spatial units under consideration, comparing results at the local community and the state level of analyses. We find that connected voluntary associations have a positive effect on the number of manufacturing establishments whereas isolated voluntary associations either have a negative effect or do not have any effect. Both local community and state level analyses reveal this pattern but the effects are stronger when the spatial unit of analysis is the local community. "
0,"Public confidence in social institutions underwent a decline in the past decades. However, confidence in scientific community as an institution, which is treated as confidence in science in this paper, has not declined as dramatically as other social institutions. Various studies address the trend of the publics confidence in science and the difference in confidence in science across demographic and social-economic variables. This paper reviews the issue of confidence in science under various perspectives and specifically examines its association with Internet use, with the assumption that Internet use might promote confidence in science. MCA results from GSS2000 data confirm this strong association between the two. The magnitude of this effect differs with sex, age, and different usage of Internet. With the effect of Internets boost in confidence in science and with the expansion of Internet use, we may expect a high level of confidence in science in the overall population. Suggestions for future research are made."
0,"According to Amnesty International (AI), approximately 370 girls and women have been murdered in Chihuahuas border city of Juárez (see Amnesty Internationals report titled Intolerable Killings 2003), earning Mexico the reputation of its largest human rights crisis in recent years (Cabrera 2004). Many womens organizations, human rights groups, and authorities have categorized the murders; those displaying patterns of extreme sexual violence characterized by brutality have been placed in one category separate from other murders that are violent but do not fit within the recognizable pattern. Despite such a separation, the violence against women in Juárez, measured by both murders and domestic violence, is part of a larger context of gender inequality that lies in the backdrop of economic restructuring. Since 1993 when the murders began, enraged women activists have pressured local authorities and Chihuahua state for answers, only to find a pattern of faulty investigations and patronizing backlash, as the growing number of murders continued. Seeking redress and gaining no answers from local, state, and federal authorities, women activists gained help from the international community, such as AI, bringing more attention to the murders as well as the nature of domestic violence in Juárez. This paper examines the transnational social movement (TSM) about violence against women in Juárez from the perspective of Juárez rape crisis center Casa Amiga and its president Esther Chávez Cano, a well-known feminist within her community and human rights circles. Exploring the ways in which this movement has unfolded as well as the strategies employed at home and within transnational networks, this paper attempts to contribute to the need for TSM literature that addresses these movements from a gender perspective. I argue that while the rights framework articulated by activists, Cano, and AI have made salient the political inequalities between men and women in Juárez; economics remain part of the problem. Furthermore, while the state remains the primary mechanism by which rights are realized, the role of transnational capital lies safely obscured. By not addressing how structural economic inequalities lived through gender is part of the inequality perpetuated in Juárez, transnational activism to stop the violence against women is hampered."

0,"The social constructionist approach to research on social issues provides a conceptual means in understanding how specific problems are generated and handled by institutional claims-makers, including the state and mass media. In neighborhood research, the voice of adolescent residents is seldom heard, let alone the value of their claims in relation to the state's construction. This article endeavors to address this in several steps: by outlining the specific developmental trajectory of low-income community in Hong Kong; by examining the dominant state discourse on the nature and ""solution'' of community problems; and by analyzing the voice of adolescent residents. Empirically, 54 Chinese adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) were recruited to participate in eight focus groups to express how they saw community conditions. Furthermore, a random sample of 22 parents of the participants was surveyed as comparison. Finally, the article suggests that adolescents' constructions provide significant opportunities developing more critically informed, ""bottom-up'' agendas for community revitalization."
0,"Using international data on educational achievement among 15-year-olds in 20 OECD countries, I compare the effect of sibship size on reading literacy and link the cross-national variation in the sibship-size effect to differences in national contexts of public policies for families and children. Comparisons highlight significant cross-national variation in the level of public policies, even among countries ordinarily thought to belong to the same welfare regime. Deviating from previous literature that focused on overall differences across welfare regimes, I explore the way in which specific public policy variables, rather than categorical regimes, mediate the relationship between sibship size and educational achievement. The results of two-level hierarchical linear models show that countries with stronger public support for childcare, universal child benefits, larger public expenditures on education and family, show a much less negative effect of growing up in large families. Moreover, these policy variables explain a large part of the better performance of social democratic countries in reducing the negative effect of sibship size. "

In line with previous research, study findings indicate that, contrary to the theory's predictions, being reintegratively shamed is positively associated with projected deviance.

These results, ill Conjunction with the accumulated body of research, Suggest that reintegrative shaming theory may be in need of further revision. "
0,"For the last two decades, American education policy has relied on test-based accountability policies to improve student achievement and to close achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. In this paper, we ask whether accountability pressure increases student performance on “high-stakes” state tests and a second “low-stakes” measure of achievement.  We determine that accountability pressure increased student gains on high-stakes math and reading tests. These accountability-induced score gains in math were twice as large as reading gains, but did not generalize to performance on the low-stakes math test. We further establish that that these effects differ substantially by race. For Hispanic students, accountability pressure increased gains on both tests in math and on the low-stakes test in reading. However, for black students, accountability pressure positively affected high-stakes math gains but negatively affected low-stakes gains, and had no significant effect on reading gains on either test. As a result, schools’ responses to accountability pressure created the appearance of a closing black-white achievement gap on the high-stakes test, while the gap grew on the low-stakes test."
0,"Panel surveys are widely used in sociology to examine life-course trajectories and to assess causal effects. However, when using panel data researchers usually assume that the act of measuring respondents' attitudes and behaviors has no effect on the attributes being measured or on the accuracy of reports about those attributes. Evidence from cognitive psychology, marketing research, political science and other fields suggests that this assumption may not be warranted. Using a rigorous experimental design, we examine the magnitude of panel conditioning bias - the bias emerging from having answered questions in prior waves of a survey - in a panel study of substance use among adolescents in Chile. We find that adolescents who answered survey questions about alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and cocaine use were considerably less likely than members of a control group to report substance use when re-interviewed one year later. This finding has important implications, and also points to the need for sociologists to be concerned about panel conditioning as an important methodological issue."
0,"Conflict is a very important theme in an organizations activities, particularly when opposing interests and goals among individuals or groups interrupt the optimal performance of such an organization.  Such situations are not alien to professional sports.  The National Basketball Association lockout of 1998 is a quintessential example of opposing parties conflicting with each other in such a way as to disrupt the normal functioning of an organization.  Many different approaches have been used to help explain this event.  Public opinion may find it easy simply to blame the players for demanding higher salaries, or simply to blame the owners for ultimately calling the lockout.  Careful analysis, though, reveals that the 1998 NBA lockout was an extremely complex event that went well beyond the financial issue.  When examining this event from a variety of angles (financial, organizational, group formational, self-evaluative, racial, and structural points of view), it appears evident that a wide variety of theories is essential in order to explain the lockout in its entirety.  The event can strongly be argued from a labor-relations perspective.  Using the work of Karl Marx, Melvin Kohn, Melvin Seeman, Gorg Simmel, Emile Durkheim, Mayer Zald and Michael Berger, L. Richard Della Fave, and Matthew Dey, it appears evident that the 1998 NBA lockout can and should be examined from a labor-relations perspective, and this event provides a firm example for the necessity of sports to be studied within the labor relations realm.  Furthermore, the problems associated with this event were not easily resolved, and the resolution itself left many questions unanswered, leading one to believe that another labor conflict will result in the NBA in the somewhat near future."

I argue that contextual factors are crucial in determining the effectiveness of social networks.

On the other hand, the effectiveness of social networks has declined significantly in the public sector of Chinas transitional labor market.  The results of my analysis suggest that a careful evaluation of these contingencies can help improve our understanding of the role of social networks."

Building on these ideas, we use peer network data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine whether peer status within highly violent groups increases male risks of high school dropout.

0,"The author examines the relationship between democracy and international trade using post-Soviet countries as a historical example of a world-system. World-systems theory and alternative theories are employed to create theoretical models of democracy, and pooled time-series regression is applied, using an index of democracy as the dependent variable and two sets of theoretically distinct control variables. The author finds a negative relationship between core periphery trade and democracy and a positive relationship between trade openness and democracy in the periphery. The author draws three conclusions. First, international trade deserves more attention as a link between economic and political processes in world-systems analysis. Second, contrary to conventional analysis, the structure of core-periphery trade shows that the core uses its economic ties to politically exploit the periphery. Last, it is necessary to distinguish between core and noncore international trade in world-systems and political analysis."
0,"To challenge the state, individuals often overcome collective action problems and form political groups.  In doing so, they organize around particular social attributes: a political group may be formed around tribal, class, religious, ethnic, or other affiliations.  This paper presents a theory to explain why, holding culture and group motivation constant, political groups might organize around one affiliation over others  or, why groups may vary in their basis of group cohesion.  Specifically, this paper presents a theory to explain the Kurdish case.  Though the Kurds organized politically as tribes before the division of Kurdistan after World War I, by the 1990s Kurdish political parties, though all similar in their struggle for self-determination, organized around different social affiliations.  Iraqi Kurds organized as tribes, Turkish Kurds as an ethnic group, and Iranian Kurds around urban-intellectual affiliations.  This paper contends that degree of state centralization and differential treatment by the centralized state dictate the basis of political group cohesion.  Where rule is indirect, political groups will organize around tribal affiliations.  Where rule is direct, differential treatment on the basis of some attribute will yield political parties that organize around that same attribute."
0,"The question raised in this paper is whether childrens own statements about their future prospect have any predictive power regarding their mortality risk, labour market attachment and economic hardship in adult life? The theoretical perspective is based on assumptions of stigmatization, stereotyping and self esteem. The empirical analysis builds on a cohort study of all children born in 1953, who resided in Stockholm metropolitan area in 1963 (N=15,117). At the age 12  13, all children in the cohort were interviewed and among other things asked if they thought that their future would be worse, similar or better compared to others in their own age. Data on mortality, labour market attachment and economic hardship were derived from register data and cover the period up to the year 2002. It was shown that children who thought that their future would be worse than that of most other children did have an increased mortality risk, were more likely to suffer from economic hardship and more often had weak labour market attachment. Data made it possible to control for a large number of conditions concerning both to parents characteristics and to childrens own characteristics. The issue whether childrens expectations themselves affect outcomes in adult life or if their expectations just reflect the circumstances under which they live could therefore be approached. The basic conclusion was that children are knowledgeable agents whose expectations of the future essentially reflect known facts (parents deeds, their own school achievements etc)."
0,"We present a model, the equity-equality equilibrium model, for fairness judgments of reward distributions in work groups.

I explore whether this proposition holds in the self-governing sport of Ultimate. While the size of the community and spatial diffusion of the sport theoretically suggests limited decentralized control, the widespread implementation of a refereed system has not yet emerged. Instead, I find with qualitative methods that cooperation in Ultimate is the result of the sport being federally controlled and embedded within tiers of organizational constraint that promote informal regulation of competitions through norms, reputations, and self-discipline."
0,"Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands - physical places with cultural meaning - are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child's chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places. "
0,"Recent patterns of labor exit in late life in the United States are increasingly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity stems from diverse employment careers that are emerging in the workplace where job security is declining. Individuals' structural locations in the labor market expose them to diverse risks for employment and income security at older ages. Among those risks are access to institutional mechanisms for retirement saving and the requirement to assume full responsibility for decisions about retirement savings that involve market risks. The spread of these individualized pressures to invest in retirement has elevated the importance of financial literacy in the 21(st) century. Late employment careers and patterns of financial literacy are studied in this article using the premier U.S. longitudinal dataset from the National Institute of Aging, the Health and Retirement Study initiated in 1992, which is linked to restricted Social Security earnings records that extend over several decades. These merged data afford the opportunity to observe continuous work histories in this sample from 1981 through 2006 to identify latent trajectories of employment in late life. In addition, a supplementary module attached to the 2004 wave of the HRS provides valuable information on the financial literacy of subgroups. The work-retirement trajectories and financial literacy patterns observed reflect persistent patterns of inequality amplified by modern risks in the labor market."
0,"This paper addresses the connection between immigration policy and sexuality.  Immigration policy is by definition exclusive: it defines which non-citizens will be allowed into the country and which will be excluded. Sexuality has been an explicit basis for exclusion, since individuals classified as homosexual were officially denied entry into the United States. More broadly, though, sexuality has been an implicit basis for inclusion or exclusion. We discuss how the Immigration Act of 1965 made heterosexual marriage the most important avenue for entry into the United States.  We then discuss the gay marriage debate and the possibility that same-sex marriage may become recognized as an individual right through judicial decision.  Next, we consider the implications that recognition of same-sex marriage would have for American immigration policy, addressing questions such as:  How would same-sex marriage affect the pool of potential immigrants to the U.S.?  How would the American public be likely to respond to immigrants entering the country through same-sex marriages?  Under what conditions might the legal recognition of same-sex marriage lead to a decoupling of marriage from immigration, and therefore to the end of the family preference system that has dominated immigration policy for the past forty years?"
0,"This article draws upon 134 in-depth interviews with activists and journalists in an effort to reconcile the extensive activism taking place in the shadows of presidential campaigns with its near invisibility in the news. In his classic work, Todd Gitlin (1980) demonstrated that activists become newsworthy only by submitting to the ""implicit rules of news making"" (p. 3). This research supports his finding, but demonstrates that unbeknownst to activists, coverage of political outsiders is governed by a set of rules quite different from (and often diametrically opposed to) those employed in routine news-gathering. Taking cues from news creation practices that go on daily between journalists, parajournalists, and subjects, activist groups work assiduously to prepare members to fit the needs of political reporters. They bend over backwards to be media-friendly, which they perceive as professional, quotable, and credible, but ironically these studied attempts to conform to the norms of routine political reporting make them less appealing to journalists. While journalists may attend eagerly to elected officials' press conferences and official statements, they demand authenticity, particularly in the form of emotion and spontaneity, from outsiders-the very attributes activists work to erase in their media trainings. In the end, the activist groups fail to obtain coverage, not because they can't conform to the rules of news making, but because they are following the wrong rules. This article maps the contradictory sets of norms at play in the negotiation over news, and shows how they work together to create nearly insurmountable cultural boundaries for political outsiders. Keywords: news, journalists, presidential campaigns, voluntary associations, social movement organizations."

0,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) social movement organizing in Namibia and South Africa has resulted in political wins and setbacks for gender and sexual minorities. Northern sexual and gender identity frameworks have gained in popularity among LGBT activists in Namibia and South Africa. However, few activists and individuals claim transgender identities. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with four LGBT social movement organizations in Johannesburg, South Africa, and Windhoek, Namibia from September 2005 to July 2006 and 48 in-depth qualitative interviews with activists, I examine the implications for few activists claiming transgender as a personal identity and the Namibian and South African movements embrace of transgender as an inclusive political strategy as activists participate in creating an African LGBT movement."
0,"The last decade has witnessed the emergence of a significant body of research on issues concerning the growing population of multiracial-identified individuals.  Yet, most of this work has focused on Black/White and Asian/White offspring.  Comparatively fewer studies have examined issues of identity among the offspring of Chicana/o and/or Latina/o intermarriage.  This roundtable will begin to fill a gap in the literature on multiracial identity as it relates to the experience and identity of individuals of partial Chicana/o Latina/o background.  Research on this population is crucial, as offspring from intermarriages with one Latina/o partner constitute the majority of multiracial births in places such as California.  Given that the offspring of Chicana/o Latina/o intermarriages, in California and the Southwest generally, will continue to grow, it is important to examine the ways in which these individuals identify themselves, the connections they have with their various communities of origin, and ultimately, whether or not and to what extent they may help transform understandings of race/ethnicity in the United States. Additionally, it is important to consider how these offspring (and multiracial individuals generally) are perceived by the larger society and how they might be incorporated into the United States racial order.  This roundtable will address these issues, particularly with regard to the following: (1) the historical foundation of racial formation in California as this relates to multiracial individuals of partial African descent; (2) multiracial individuals of Chicana/o and Punjabi Asian Indian descent; (4) multiracial individuals of Chicana/o and Filipina/o descent; and (4) multiracial individuals of Chicana/o and European American descent."
0,"Today women with young children account for a substantial share of the labor force. New mothers’ participation in paid employment has profound implications for a broad variety of social relations including the need for families to balance work and family responsibilities. Although many studies have made substantial contributions to our understanding of women’s labor market participation, only a few have made a satisfactory assessment of the labor force decisions mothers face following the birth of a child. Using event history techniques we explore mothers’ use of childcare and time to labor force entry. We test the two classic hypotheses of economic capital negatively effecting mothers’ labor force participation, and human capital positively effecting mothers’ labor force participation, and introduces a third hypothesis: whether available childcare – potentially understood as a form of capital - is positively associated with mothers’ subsequent labor force entry following a childbirth. The results provide strong support for this childcare capital hypothesis. The effect of using any prior non-parental childcare on the hazard of entering the labor force remains stable, strong, and significant when adding measures of economic and human capital as well as socio-demographic variables to the model. Thus, we argue that use of childcare must be included as a separate domain in the literature, since it is an essential and independent tool in mothers’ (and families’) navigation of the work-family dilemma alongside economic and human capital."
0,"Humans transformed landscapes at an unprecedented scale and pace during the 20th century, creating sprawling urban areas in affluent countries and large-scale agricultural expanses in tropics. To date, attempts to explain these processes in other disciplines have had a disembodied, ahistorical quality to them. A sociological account of these changes emphasizes the role of strategic actions by states and coalitions of interested parties in transforming landscapes. It identifies the agents of change and the timing of transformative events. Case studies of suburban sprawl and tropical deforestation illustrate the value of the sociological approach and the wide range of situations to which it applies."
0,"This case-study examines the determinants of hazard and risk perception and the attitudes toward risk mitigation from people exposed to soil pollution. Using an ecological-symbolic approach, a model is developed that draws upon individual, social and cultural perspectives on risk perception by using structured questionnaires, and includes ecological variables by using data of experts risk assessments. The results of multiple linear regressions show that hazard perception is best predicted by objective knowledge, estimated knowledge of experts, and the real risks. However, objective risk induced an increase in hazard perception only when residents knew the decontamination-urgency of their parcel. Risk perception was best predicted by trust in the risk management. Neither risk assessments nor hazard perceptions significantly contributed to the explanation of variance. Further, residents risk-tolerance significantly related to hazard perception, risk perception, estimated knowledge of experts, and thoughts about sustainability. This study shows that laypeople can make a difference between hazards and risks. The results demonstrate that efforts to retrain the residents should be abandoned and replaced by more deliberative methods that can cope with the limits of expert-knowledge. In addition, it is argued that policymakers sustainable management of soils on a local scale should be framed within a broader political agenda on sustainability."
0,"In the late 1990s a rural community development movement emerged in Lithuania. According to prevailing perception, the majority of community movement organizers and participants are educated professional women who, during the Soviet-era administered and coordinated the social infrastructure of ""kolkhoz"" or collective farms (teachers, office clerks, accountants, nurses). However, as a consequence of agricultural privatization in the post-Soviet period, a large number of educated professional women have been ""laid-off"" and forced to become full-time housewives. Many such women have become active in a movement of rural communities attempting to improve living conditions and find solutions to local social and economic problems. By most accounts women comprise a large segment of the core activists in this rural mobilization.   This paper relies upon data collected during 2004 on a nationally representative sample of local (village-level) organizations in rural Lithuania (N=237). The paper describes the population of rural movement organizations and specifies the extent to which they mobilize women and are led by women.  Furthermore, the paper identifies and discusses how organizations strongly influenced by female leadership differ in terms of their issue priorities, public activities, and impacts from organizations with predominantly male leaders and those with relatively balanced leadership."
0,"Using data from 6070 U.S. heterosexual internet dating profiles, this study examines how racial and gender exclusions are revealed in the preferences of black, Latino, Asian and white online daters. Consistent with social exchange and group positions theories, the study finds that whites are least open to out-dating and that, unlike blacks, Asians and Latinos have patterns of racial exclusion similar to those of whites. Like blacks, higher earning groups including Asian Indians, Middle Easterners and Asian men are highly excluded, suggesting that economic incorporation may not mirror acceptance in intimate settings. Finally, racial exclusion in dating is gendered; Asian males and black females are more highly excluded than their opposite-sex counterparts, suggesting that existing theories of race relations need to be expanded to account for gendered racial acceptance."
0,"This article argues that a modified version of Bourdieu's habitus concept can generate insights into moral Culture and the ways people use culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors, and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than is modernist culture."
0,"Public opinion toward undocumented immigration is discussed in the popular media yet receives less attention in the social science literature. With data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U. S. Census, and the General Social Survey, this study examines whites' immigration opinions in 1996 and 2004. The results indicate that in 1996 whites who lived in areas with greater unemployment were more likely to favor government action against undocumented immigrants, while in 2004 whites who lived in areas with more Latino residents were less likely to favor such action. Whites who are embedded in educated networks and networks with racially different contacts are more likely to be sympathetic toward undocumented immigrants. Older networks were associated with restrictionist opinions. The interpersonal environment appears to remain consequential for whites, even if they have no contact with undocumented immigrants. This study finds that opinion formation results from broad demographic and small interpersonal structures."
0,"Drawing on a larger study of media and opinion, this paper examines the impact that changes in the space of opinion have had on conservative political discourse in the US.  Specifically, we argue that the cultural contours of cable television's opinion formats crystallized in the post-September 11 climate, and could be seen most clearly in the growing differences between two of the most visible programs on cable news at that time: Fox News Channel's Hannity and Colmes, and CNN's Crossfire. While Crossfire remained relatively unchanged, Hannity and Colmes made important modifications to their program, which allowed them to overcome some of the constraints that had characterized previous version of the dueling-host opinion program. These innovations led to further format innovation in the space of opinion and a new cultural environment for conservative political discourse. We conclude by considering the impact these changes are having on Republican Party political leaders, and to the larger political public sphere in which they operate."
0,"industrial effects have long been significant factors in wage inequality. Previous research indicates that wage differentials across industries were increasing through the mid 1980s. Using more recent data, however, we find that the level of inter-industry wage dispersion declined by 36% from 1986 to 2002 despite the continued trend towards increasing inequality in the labor force. This decline in inter-industry wage dispersion is evident across gender and educational groups. Using multilevel growth curve models, our multivariate results indicate that the decline is only weakly related to industrial changes in education, occupation or even productivity despite the fact that the latter variable had been a critical factor in the prior period. Indicators of globalization and downsizing also do not appear to explain this decline. For the more recent period, the most important factors associated with the narrowing of inter-industry wage dispersion are reduced unionization rates and the higher proportion of casual workers. We interpret these results as suggesting that firms may now be less economically obliged to pass on a portion of their rents to broad groups of workers and may instead be engaged in more idiosyncratic processes of negotiation with individual workers based on micro-level sources of bargaining power.

0,"The relationship between psychological disciplines and inequality has been a subject of great scholarly interest in the last several decades. Most works on the subject analyze macro features of psychological disciplines (mainly their evaluative tools, theoretical assumptions, and disciplinary power) and criticize them as biased against minorities. This paper re-examines the relationship between psychology and inequality from a micro, face-to-face standpoint. Drawing on close observations of 33 placement committees in which professionals from various psychological fields (psychology, social work, school counseling, etc.) discuss children's eligibility for special education services, it portrays the actual doing of psychology as an inconsistent and malleable endeavor. In contrast to the macro-oriented research on the relationship between psychology and inequality, it shows that in actual face-to-face interactions, professionals use different types of folk concerns that often exchange formal evaluative criteria, theoretical assumptions or professional authority in final placement decisions. By revealing the different folk considerations professionals use to sort and analyze working- versus middle-class parents, this project adds an essential layer to scholarly understanding of the relationship between psychological practice and inequality."
0,"This paper presents the results of a study of eight undergraduate classes that implemented a student-facilitated discussion process as a means of improving the ability of students to engage diversity-related topics.  The discussion process, designed by the Interactivity Foundation (IF), emphasizes student-led, democratic discussion that aims to raise policy possibilities rather than the traditional top-down, instructor-led discussion model.  The purpose of the study was to determine if the IF process correlated with less conflict in the classroom when talking about sensitive topics like diversity, and also to determine if students and teachers had better outcomes related to student satisfaction, learning, and interaction.  This study did find that the implementation of the IF process resulted in less classroom conflict and improved student outcomes, in particular to more student interactions and collaboration inside and outside the classroom, an outcome that has implications for improving student retention and the college experience as a whole, particularly for first-generation students."
0,"The research findings with respect to the relationship between incarceration and employment are consistent enough that it is tempting to conclude that incarceration causes deterioration in ex-inmates' employment prospects. Yet, causality remains tenuous for several reasons. For one, studies frequently rely on samples of nonincarcerated subjects that are not truly ""at risk"" of incarceration, which undermines their use as comparison samples and potentially biases estimates of the impact of incarceration on life outcomes. Additionally, even with confidence about causal identification, the field remains ignorant about the precise mechanism by which incarceration erodes employment and earnings. To address these gaps, this study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to estimate the impact of incarceration during late adolescence and early adulthood on short- and long-term employment outcomes. The subjects of interest are all individuals who are convicted of a crime for the first time, some of whom receive a sentence of incarceration following their conviction. Broad measures of legal and illegal employment are used to explore possible avenues by which incarceration affects individual work histories."
0,"In their influential article Socially Embedded Consumer Transactions: For What Kinds of Purchases Do People Most Often Use Networks? DiMaggio and Louch (1998) use the transaction as the unit-of-analysis, examining the variation of transaction types across individuals.  They distinguish this from an approach that examines variation among individuals across transactions.  This manuscript elaborates a third overlooked analytic strategy that examines variation in transaction opportunities across contexts.  In support of this third approach, the manuscript shows that the DiMaggio and Louch proposition concerning the effects of transaction frequency is context specific."
0,"More than one out of every five principals leaves their school each year. In some cases, these career changes are driven by the choices of district leadership. In other cases, principals initiate the move, often demonstrating preferences to work in schools with higher achieving students from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Principals often use schools with many poor or low-achieving students as stepping stones to what they view as more desirable assignments. We use longitudinal data from one large urban school district to study the relationship between principal turnover and school outcomes. We find that principal turnover is, on average, detrimental to school performance. Frequent turnover of school leadership results in lower teacher retention and lower student achievement gains. Leadership changes are particularly harmful for high poverty schools, low-achieving schools, and schools with many inexperienced teachers. These schools not only suffer from high rates of principal turnover but are also unable to attract experienced successors. The negative effect of leadership changes can be mitigated when vacancies are filled by individuals with prior experience leading other schools. However, the majority of new principals in high poverty and low-performing schools lack prior leadership experience and leave when more attractive positions become available in other schools. "
0,"Although the boy crisis, or the notion that boys are falling behind girls in schools, has been a popular topic in the news for years, few have used a comprehensive approach to explain boys´ academic achievement that includes research on gender theory and adolescent development.  Certain constructions of masculinity, augmented by intersections of race/ethnicity, time and development, and sexuality, may deny some boys the capital needed for high educational achievement."
0,"Expanding market logic is intruding into every social setting in the United States, subverting the strength of any ethic that contradicts relentless productivity, consumption and competition. Three historical factors can account for this shift. First, the most fundamental source is the expansive logic inherent to the market itself. The second factor is the gap between our nation’s stated ideals of equality and democracy and the reality of injustice and exclusion. This contradiction became more conspicuous after World War II and led to heightened tension during the rigid assertion of authority during the 1950s. The third factor, which was activated to some extent by that tension, was the diminished credibility of institutional authority produced by the turmoil of the sixties. The weakening of five particular countervailing institutions -- religion, unions, media, education and government – has been especially consequential. The further expansion of market logic has contributed to a moral crisis. This involves deteriorating capacities for durable, meaningful relationships, a problem played out in numerous institutional failures and individual problems."
0,"Public subsidies to business have increasingly become defined by political forces on both the left and right as corporate welfare. While the concept has its origins in the New Left, it was discovered by the political mainstream only in the 1990s. As a result, the dominant definitions of the problem presented in political debate have been those associated with free market conservatives. The foundation of the conservative critique is the presumed existence of a dichotomy between public and private. The liberal-left critique tacitly accepts the existence of this dichotomy, and so has the consequence of challenging specific corporations while accepting fundamental capitalist relations."
0,"Using a panel of states between 1975 and 2005, I examine the relationship between the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and abortion. Results suggest that increases in the EITC are associated with reductions in the overall abortion rate. Specifically, a $1000 increase in the maximum credit is associated with a 7.6% decrease in the overall abortion rate. This effect implies a reduction of approximately 1.6 abortions per 1000 women of childbearing age. I also provide evidence that the reduction in abortions is attributable to a drop in pregnancies, not an increase in the number of births. In other words, women appear to respond to increases in EITC generosity by altering sexual behavior, rather than shifting abortion-birth decisions after a pregnancy occurs. "
0,"Since 1998, opposition to mosques has occurred in 47 different Spanish cities.  While such opposition is not uncommon in the post-September 11th world, the level of regional variation within Spain is striking.  In most regions with large Muslim populations, opposition to mosques is virtually absent, whereas in Catalonia opposition has taken place in 27 different cities.  This paper explains why mosque opposition has been more frequent in Catalonia than in other Spanish regions.  Drawing on the work of Sewell, a multi-causal argument is advanced that considers conjunctural circumstances, structural preconditions, and strategic interactions.  It is argued that while terrorist attacks and rapid immigration have raised concerns across the country, opposition has tended to occur only in locales where there is a predisposition among certain collectives to opposing mosques.  In Catalonia, these locales are generally characterized by dense civic ties and a high proportion of internal migrants.  By analyzing regional variation and popular mobilization, this study helps to fill major gaps in the literature on Islam in the West, which has tended to view national contexts as monolithic and to focus exclusively on elite-driven policies and discourses.  It also sheds light on intergroup relations more generally and the conditions under which they are likely to become contentious."
0,"One of the great paradoxes of institutional change is that even when top managers in organizations provide support for change in response to new regulation, the employees whom new programs are designed to benefit often do not use them. This 15-month ethnographic study of two hospitals responding to new regulation demonstrates that using these programs may require subordinate employees to challenge middle managers with opposing interests. The article argues that relational spaces-areas of isolation, interaction, and inclusion that allow middle-manager reformers and subordinate employees to develop a cross-position collective for change-are critical to the change process. These findings have implications for research on institutional change and social movements."
0,"This paper examines the multiple paths of educational mobility that segmented assimilation theory proposes.  Using National Educational Longitudinal Study and Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study data, I examine how context of reception, adaptation obstacles, and protective factors are associated with intergenerational educational mobility paths, from parents to their own (young adult) children, among children of immigrants.  I take into account three factors that segmented assimilation theory and research overlook:  (1) parents initial educational levels, (2) gender, and (3) immigrant generational status.  Logistic regression analyses reveal that educational mobility paths and the factors associated with them differ by these factors.  These associations are enormously complicated and do not follow a coherent pattern.  Nonetheless, a number of my findings contradict segmented assimilations claims.  For example, under some conditions, blacks have more positive mobility outcomes than whites.  Additionally, some characteristics associated with minority oppositional subcultures are related to positive educational mobility for children of immigrants.  Among the protective factors, I find little evidence that cultural attachments promote greater economic success among immigrants offspring.  These results indicate that exposure to native minorities may not be as detrimental and immigrant cultural attachments may not be as protective as segmented assimilation theory alleges."
0,"This paper examines portrayals of transgender characters in Hollywood films in order to explore what messages about gender and sexuality depictions of gender deviant characters elicit. It concludes that these films use gender deviant characters to teach gender conformity. The films do not promote this conformity by physically punishing the transgressors, as has been done in films made before 1990, but instead promote gender conformity by depicting transgender characters as tragically loveless matchmakers for straight characters as well as using transwomen as examples of ideal women who teach non-transwomen how to better conform to gender norms. Over all, these films both promote heteronormativity and gender conformity while saying that homophobia and transphobia are wrong."
0,"Although risk assessments are critical inputs to economic and organizational decision-making, we lack a good understanding of the social and political causes of shifts in risk perceptions and the consequences of those changes. This article uses social movement theory to explain the effect of environmental activism on corporations' perceived environmental risk and actual financial performance. We define environmental risk as audiences' perceptions that a firm's practices or policies will lead to greater potential for an environmental failure or crisis that would expose it to financial decline. Using data on environmental activism targeting U.S. firms between 2004 and 2008, we examine variation in the effectiveness of secondary and primary stakeholder activism in shaping perceptions about environmental risk. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that primary stakeholder activism against a firm affects its perceived environmental risk, which subsequently has a negative effect on the firm's financial performance."

0,"Evidence of a robust relationship between social support and health has accumulated over the past several decades. However, questions remain about how the support/health relationship varies among different health outcomes and whether benefits are universal.  In fact, growing evidence points to wide variation in which aspects of health are improved by what type of support and for whom.  In this study, we contribute to the understanding of this variation by comparing how structural (social integration) and functional (instrumental) support predict different indicators of health in older adults: physical functioning, number of illnesses, self-reported health and depression.  Further, we examine how these relationships vary by gender. Using longitudinal panel data to control for baseline health, we create a rigorous test of when and for whom structural and functional forms of support provide direct pathways to mental and physical health."
0,"Sociologists struggle to get students to understand that from a biological perspective race is a meaningless concept because humans cannot be classified into neat racial categories. By insisting that race is a socially constructed concept, they often lose students who recognize that human populations do exhibit physical variations and that those variations seem to have a great deal of significance in American social life. The authors suggest that introductory and other sociology instructors will benefit from a review of the argument that Franz Boas mounted in opposition to the proponents of eugenics and scientific racism that were prevalent during his lifetime. It is further suggested that sociologists can benefit by becoming more familiar with anthropological discourse on the topic and that the move toward full acceptance of Qualitative Sociology is a step in the right direction."
0,"The current political environment, specifically No Child Left Behind, has given sociologists, educators and those interested in the environment of the public schools added impetus to do several things.  First, it is critical to bring into the pedagogical discussion the research from related disciplines.  Sociologists have studied the emergence of inequality in small groups for decades.  This has become the base in our study of collaborative learning groups.  We will summarize the current research and describe the on-going efforts in this area.  Second, it is equally critical that we operationalize the theoretical base related to cognitive development, most especially the work of Piaget, Arlin, and other cognitive psychologists.  This operational definition focuses on the outward and visible sign, that of cognitive behavior, as it relates to collaborative learning groups.  We will discuss the current status of that research and the planned steps to continue both validation and reliability checks for the coding.  Third, the relationship between the emergence of inequality, cognitive behavior, and the nature of the task provides the basis for prediction about the effectiveness of collaborative learning groups and about ways to make collaborative learning groups more effective in producing learning in individuals."
0,"The Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago are considered relatively successful examples of post-colonial development as measured by macro-economic indicators such as high growth rate levels and GDP per capita. However at the ground level, income inequality, rates of poverty and unemployment are distinctly low in the Republic of Cyprus when compared to Cyprus (and even when compared to many advanced capitalist nations).  In 1974, approximately fourteen years after their independence, major shifts occurred in both these nations economies.  The Republic of Cyprus lost its most productive tourist and industrial zones. The Republic of Trinidad, having primarily an oil exporting economy, experienced a financial windfall due to the hike in international petroleum prices. Focusing on the last thirty years of national economic development, this paper uses semi-structured interviews conducted with past and present government officials, state policy documents, and government archives to consider the unforeseen outcome of each nations postcolonial development history. What lead to the unusual economic progress in Cyprus and relatively favorable socio-circumstances for the majority of the Cypriot population?  Why, despite increased government revenue, do many Trinidadian struggle to meet basic needs?  Certainly many factors contribute to explaining the difference in socio-economic status of the population in these two island-nations.  This paper focuses on how colonialism patterns ethnic relations and shaped the development strategies each government enacted in response to the events of 1974.  Theoretically, this paper contributes to postcolonial analyses by demonstrating ways that racial/ethnic ideologies influence social and economic policies and contributes to economic success or failure."
0,"This project explores cohort and period trends in political participation in the United States between 1973 and 2008. We examine the extent to which protest attendance and petition signing have diffused to different kinds of actors across multiple generations; we test claims central to understanding trends in social movement participation. Using aggregated, cross-sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance diffused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects. We argue that social movement activities have not become a widespread means of civic engagement."
0,"Popularity is measured in multiple ways.  Psychologists often use cumulative measures of affect, as in liked most nominations, while sociologists often ask students to nominate the popular crowd.  Network researchers typically use number of friends or centrality in a friendship network as a proxy.  Few studies have compared multiple methods.  This paper considers the network positions of school elites, as indicated by high school yearbooks.  Elites are strongly clustered in a few cliques, but are no more central than average students.  Academic achievement has a weak, positive, indirect effect elite status.  Sports participation was strongly related to elite status, and males who do not play sports are unlikely to be elites.  Students who placed a high value on being popular are more likely to become so."
0,"Youth violent victimization represents a major criminal and public health burden on communities of all sizes. Recent years have seen a resurgence in the interest of the influence of social disorganization on violence rates. Although most of this research has been carried out on urban areas, a highly cited Osgood and Chambers (2000) study extended the generalizeability of social disorganization as an explanation of the distribution of rates of youth violence to rural areas. In the present study, our initial goal was first to replicate the Osgood and Chambers (O-C) findings, then to extend their work by determining if the effects of social disorganization on youth violence are moderated by community size and density. In doing so, we employed rural Missouri counties as units of analysis, information on serious violent victimization from hospital records, and the same measures of social disorganization as O-C. Our results, however, revealed little effects to be moderated. Unlike O-C, we found only one of the five structural antecedents of social disorganization to be associated with rates of youth violent victimization in rural areas. These findings suggest that social disorganization may not be as robust an explanation for rural crime as many believe it to be, and we provide several methodological and theoretical reasons why it may be too early to draw strong conclusions about the generalizeability of social disorganization to youth violence in rural areas."
0,"This study examines the gender difference in educational expectations among black, white, and Hispanic high school seniors in 1972 and 1992. We link gender-related changes in expectations to students' perceived parental encouragement for higher education and access to college-preparatory coursework, and then examine the influence of expectations on subsequent educational attainments. In contrast to 1972, girls in 1992 perceived their parents to be equally or more encouraging of their pursuit of higher education than did boys, and girls were more likely to be enrolled in college preparatory coursework. The changes were most dramatic among white students, and the rise in expectations among high school girls independently contributes to their recent advances in higher education.

0,"Under the background of social transition and economic globalization, industrial renewal and urbanization are two significant topics about social development. Industrial renewal imposes direct influence on the change of social and economic structure and quality while the level of urbanization reflects the developing phase of a country. Nowadays, China is playing a paramount role in the worlds economic stage, and itself is in drastic social transition too. Therefore, combining the history and Chinese characteristics to study industrial renewal and urbanization is of great signality. Most current research has only studied urbanization from a single facet which had a too abstract view on the relationship between industrial renewal and urbanization and which wasnt able to penetrate the intrinsic interactive model between them. This article takes urbanization as a synthetical system. By theoretical and practical analyses, it deduces the internal interactive mechanism between industrial renewal and urbanization applicable for the whole world. Then, by international comparison of the two processes, it concludes the general law that will guide us to explore the road of industrial renewal and urbanization in China according to its own delicate situation."
0,"Relationship quality tends to decline following the birth of a child among married couples.  Cohabiting couples, who have less commitment than marrieds, may experience an even greater decline in relationship quality after a nonmarital birth given the greater uncertainty about their future.  Father involvement and coparenting, both indicators for commitment and support, may offset the decline in relationship quality for new parents, particularly for cohabiting parents and for mothers.  Using Fragile Families data to employ dyadic hierarchical growth curve models, I find support for these hypotheses.  Fathers’ reported level of relationship quality does not decline following a birth as it does for mothers.  Cohabitors who marry do not report relationship quality that is significantly different than continuously married parents.  Father involvement and coparenting are associated with increases in relationship quality for both mothers and fathers but are stronger for mothers.  These results show that pre- and post-natal programs should encourage involvement by fathers to minimize the stress associated with the presence of a new child, particularly for cohabiting couples."
0,This paper compares survey results of attendees at the U.S. Social Forum meeting in Atlanta in 2007 with surveys from the United States Social Forum in 2010 in Detroit to study continuities and changes in the alliances among social movements. Respondents indicated their active involvement in a list of twenty-seven social movements. Around 60% of respondents indicted active involvement in two or more movements and from these choices we can see which movements share individual activists and we can infer the structure of alliances among the movements. Since we have results over a three year period and from social forum meetings in different locales we can use formal network analysis to examine continuities and changes in the structure of alliances. A main problem of the problem of the paper will be to disentangle differences that may be due to the different meeting sites from differences that are due changes over time in the structure of movement alliances.
0,"This paper examines the impact of race, family background, and parental investments on a behavioral manifestation of educational expectations: where students apply to college. Submitting an application to colleges is an important step in the transition to college because the majority of four-year colleges require Students to apply before enrolling. This paper documents the effects of social origins on the selectivity of where high school seniors applied, based on a national sample from the class of 2004. The results show general support for the contention that social background and parental investments influence where students apply to college. Minority students are more likely to apply to selective colleges than comparable white students. Parental education is positively associated with the selectivity of the college to which students apply. Family structure and sibship size, however. are not associated with applying to a selective college. Parental economic and interactional investments are also associated with where students apply to college. I further examine the interplay between family background and race and find that family background exerts a uniform influence on where students apply irrespective of race and ethnic origin. "
0,"The gender-related social changes taking place in western society call for a new theoretical narrative of the relationship between gender and health. As both biological sex and social gender become less fixed and more fluid, the traditional distinctions between male and female experience are breaking down and being reconfigured in new and more complex ways. This has significant but as yet generally unexplored implications for health. Since health is fundamental to explaining life chances, its neglect impoverishes feminist sociologists ability to understand the social changes that are affecting womens lives.  Feminist theory and medical sociology have parted company in recent years. In this paper I argue that bringing them together is essential for an adequate understanding of both gender inequalities in health and womens experience in contemporary society.  I explore ways in which this may be achieved in a critical analysis of second and third wave feminist conceptualisations of the relationship between sex/gender that has been central not only to understanding the social patterning of mens and womens health, but also their wider social experience."

0,"In this paper, I examine the interaction between an emergent community movement in Puerto Rico and a poverty policy program (Comunidades Especiales) implemented by the Puerto Rico government intended to deal with widespread neighborhood poverty in a self-claimed radical way.  The phenomenon I examine is situated within a blurry boundary zone between social movements as generally understood, conventional civic participation, and public policy.  What is dramatic about this case is that the direction of development is strongly from state-sponsorship of the program to autonomous movement development and claims-making, and not the reverse, although most of the community movement leaders and participants had considerable experience as leaders in other domains  religious organizations, athletics, unions, and neighborhood associations among others.  In addition to explaining the development of this autonomous, but state-sponsored, community movement, I examine three discursive themes that emerged from fieldwork observations and interviews with over twenty community movement leaders:  (1) recasting dependency arguments in a critique of conventional (status) politics and government policy towards the poor; (2) dismantling party (status) politics as usual and articulating an interest-based politics; and (3) embracing the rhetorical and coercive power of law.   The implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"Ex-prisoners tend to be geographically concentrated in a relatively small number of neighborhoods within the most resource deprived sections of metropolitan areas. Furthermore, many prisoners return ""home"" to the same criminogenic environment with the same criminal opportunities and criminal peers that proved so detrimental prior to incarceration. Yet estimating the causal impact of place of residence on the likelihood of recidivism is complicated by the issue of selection bias. In this study, I use a natural experiment as a means of addressing the selection issue and examine whether the migration of ex-prisoners away from their former place of residence will lead to lower levels of recidivism. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Louisiana Gulf Coast, damaging many of the neighborhoods where ex-prisoners typically reside. The residential destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina is an exogenous source of variation that influences where a parolee will reside upon release from prison. Findings reveal that moving away from former geographic areas substantially lowers a parolee likelihood of re-incarceration."
0,"The sex difference in depression is well documented in westernized, developed societies, although there has been little quantitative cross-cultural research on the topic. Sociologists have argued that the sex difference in depression is primarily a result of unequal social and economic roles in westernized, developed societies. Conversely, evolutionary psychologists have argued that the greater tendency of women towards depression is an evolved predisposition. In this study, we examine gender differences in depression across 26 westernized and non-westernized countries using data from the U.S. General Social Survey and the World Values Survey. Consistent with evolutionary arguments, young women across all types of countries are more likely to report depressive symptoms than young men. Consistent with sociological arguments, the gender difference in depression among those over 50 is only found in westernized, developed countries."
0,"Despite the well documented cases of racism toward gay Asian men in the gay community, there is currently little research examining how gay Asian men manage and negotiate gay racial stigma. In this article, we examine stigma management and negotiation strategies employed by gay Asian men and explore how gay Asian men engage in stigma management strategies in order to maintain a positive sense of self and counter the effects of racism in the gay community."
0,"As social and economic stratification between black and white Americans persists at the dawn of the twenty-first century, disparities in educational outcomes remain an especially formidable barrier Recent research on the black/white achievement gap points to a perplexing pattern in this regard. Schools appear to exacerbate black/white disparities in learning while simultaneously slowing the growth of social class gaps. How might this occur? Using 1st grade data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), I test-and find support for-the proposition that school factors play an elevated role in generating the black/white achievement gap while non-school factors primarily drive social class inequalities. These findings help explain why black/white achievement disparities grow mostly during the school year (when schools are in session and have their greatest impact on students' learning) while class gaps widen mostly during the summer (when school is out of session and non-school influences dominate). I conclude by discussing the implications for future research, especially as they pertain to what appears to be the most important contributor to the black/white achievement gap: school racial segregation."
0,"Research into environmental concern and behavior has been extensive in the past few decades. The connection between the two, as well as other related variables, has however remained somewhat elusive. This study attempts to refine our understanding of how concern for the environment is related to pro-environmental behavior such as buying ecologically friendly products, driving less, conserving resources at home, recycling, etc., by considering the role played by social structural context and self-efficacy. Furthermore, through principle component analysis a particular dimension of pro-environmental behavior is identified so as to produce more robust and consistent results. Social structural context and self-efficacy are found to be powerful mediators of the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior. Lastly, social structural context, as measured by the availability of curbside recycling, is shown to act as a gateway to additional pro-environmental behaviors beyond recycling."
0,"This paperexamines how distinctive groups within Londons middle class live in particular zones of the city. It emphasises the differentiation of the middle class into different urban sites, and shows how different middle class areas  form settings for the development of specific forms of social capital. The paper explores in particular how certain zones appeal to the middle class because they  do not form sites of localized networks of established groups that can produce social capital, and are hence socially empty spaces for middle class colonisation. On the other hand, other middle class areas encourage more positive bonding within the ranks of middle class gentrifiers. Butler shows how the differences between these types of places relate to processes of class formation."
0,"I construct covariate-adjusted increment-decrement life tables to estimate racial differences in the duration of children's exposure to neighborhood poverty and affluence. Using geocoded data from the 1999 and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I estimate that black children born in 1999 can expect to spend about 9 of their first 18 years in poor neighborhoods, compared to less than 2 years for white children. Bivariate inequality in childhood exposure is reduced by 16% after controlling for racial differences in household characteristics, by 39% after controlling for differences in the racial composition and spatial location of children's neighborhoods, and by 46% after controlling for both sets of factors. These findings indicate that household and especially urban ecological factors strongly affect the amount of time that black and white children can expect to spend in poor and nonpoor neighborhoods throughout childhood. I conclude by discussing some policy implications of the findings. "
0,"The originality of this theoretical paper stems from the fact that it brings a sociological perspective to the study of team diversity, an area currently dominated by organizational behavioral and managerial perspectives. Although diversity has become one of the most fashionable organizational strategies in corporate America, the current literature on team diversity is full of gaps and contradictory findings. This article reveals how sociological theories never explored before in the literature on team diversity (e.g. Symbolic Interactionism, Exchange Theory etc.) could open the door to new and innovative research studies forecasting the competitive advantage of diverse work teams. Methodological and managerial implications are also visited."
0,"This article underscores the importance of online research in illuminating the social processes underlying Internet effects on politics. It is an empirical study of the effect of blogs on the 2008 general election in Malaysia. Using the population of electoral candidates in the 2008 general election ( N = 471), the author estimates a logistic model predicting the effects of having a blog on winning a Parliamentary seat. The results show that opposition candidates benefit significantly more from having a blog than do non-opposition candidates, as blogging provides opportunities denied to them by Malaysia's state-controlled media. Bloggers are more than seven times as likely to win an election compared to non-bloggers, controlling for incumbency, party membership, and race. In addition to being an alternative avenue of information distribution, blogs' potential for building interpersonal relationships and their role as mobilization tools in media-controlling states are discussed using qualitative examples."
0,"It has long been noted that religious congregations tend to be racially homogenous. Previous case studies assert that members of a numerical minority group face individual and organizational pressures that lead them to leave congregations faster than majority members. This can create a constant pull toward homogeneity despite congregational efforts to diversify. Building on theory in organizational ecology, we test this assertion using national, multi level data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey. The analysis shows that members of a numerical minority do have shorter durations of membership than majority members and that the gap between the two increases with the size of the majority."
0,"Women represent the fastest growing criminal population, growing by almost a third over the course of the 1990s, and almost a third of all incarcerated women report having been on welfare in the period just prior to their arrest.  And yet despite this apparent dramatic increase in the criminal behavior of poor women, the study of womens criminality remains in its infancy.  Drawing on life course theory, however, some feminist scholars are taking steps to address this hole in the literature, and the most striking finding to emerge from the field of feminist criminology is that the best predictor of female criminality is a history of sexual or physical abuse victimization.  In this paper, we seek to test this finding, which we term a victim model of female criminality, using interviews with a sample of current and former welfare recipients.  However, using both interview and survey data, and determining criminality using administrative records, we ultimately find very little support for the victim model of female criminal behavior, finding instead that the life course events that have been identified as criminal triggers do not appear to occur disproportionately among criminal women."
0,"This research investigates the effect of status differentiation on R&D team innovation.  In particular, the paper addresses an unresolved, yet important, issue in the team literature: Is a hierarchical team or an egalitarian team more innovative?  We examine this question by using the complete dataset of U.S. pharmaceutical patents (1975-99) and find that a hierarchical team performs better than an egalitarian team only if the hierarchical level is suitably high.  However, if the hierarchical level is low, then an egalitarian team in which none of the team members had any previous productivity performs better.  For organizations facing the pressing need to continually innovate and develop, this research suggests that it is ideal to form highly hierarchical R&D teams, with a less desirable option being an egalitarian team in which no member had prior patents.  In general, teams whose hierarchical level is low should be avoided.  The results of this research have important implications for the pharmaceutical industry as it provides a framework for how companies can organize and structure teams in order to increase innovation."
0,"This article describes the impact of the Italian electoral reforms of 1993 on the structure of local political alliances. The reform, which moved Italy from a purely proportional representation system to a mixed, largely majoritarian system, was designed to increase transparency, reduce corruption, limit the number of political parties, and create the conditions for a politics of interests rather than a politics of influence. Paradoxically, moving to a mixed electoral system had the opposite effect. In this article we demonstrate this impact by modeling the structure of political alliances at multiple levels (municipal, provincial and regional) of the Italian polity from 1984 to 2001."
0,"Focusing on micro-level processes of residential segregation, this analysis combines data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with contextual information from three censuses and several other sources to examine patterns of residential mobility between neighborhoods populated by different combinations of racial and ethnic groups. We find that despite the emergence of multiethnic neighborhoods, stratified mobility dynamics continue to dominate, with relatively few black or white households moving into neighborhoods that could be considered multiethnic. However, we also find that the tendency for white and black households to move between neighborhoods dominated by their own group varies significantly across metropolitan areas. Black and white households' mobility into more integrated neighborhoods is shaped substantially by demographic, economic, political, and spatial features of the broader metropolitan area. Metropolitan-area racial composition, the stock of new housing, residential separation of black and white households, poverty rates, and functional specialization emerge as particularly important predictors. These macro-level effects reflect opportunities for intergroup residential contact as well as structural forces that maintain residential segregation."
0,"We use survey data from A accepted applicants to Teach for America 1993-98 to assess the longer-term effect Of Youth service on participants' current civic attitudes and behaviors. While TFA ""graduates"" score higher than the two comparison groups-""dropouts"" and ""non-matriculants""-on a broad range of attitudinal items measuring civic commitment, these differences appear to be less a byproduct of the TFA experience than a reflection of current involvement with the TFA organization. Moreover, the attitudinal differences are not reflected in actual civic behavior. Specifically, graduates lag behind non-matriculants in current service activity and generally trail both non-matriculauts and drop-OutS in self-reported participation in five other forms of civic/political activity measured in the study. Graduates also vote at lower rates than the other two groups. Finally, fewer graduates report employment in ""pro-social"" jobs than either non-matriculants or drop-outs. We close by speculating on what mechanisms may help explain variation in the long-term effects of youth service or activist experiences."
0,"Among those who use multiple regression or its offshoots, the dominant method of modeling an interaction effect of two independent variables oil a dependent variable is to include a product variable in a linear estimation equation. In this paper, I show how the coefficient for the product variable in these models depends on the causal mechanism that underlies the interaction effect. I also show that different causal mechanisms can imply the same estimation equation, which means that one cannot determine the causal mechanism underlying an interaction effect from the empirical results produced by the estimation equation. Social scientists typically lack the kind of theoretical knowledge required to specify Causal mechanisms for interaction effects, and researchers who do specify a mechanism, such as those who specify that contextual-level variables moderate the effects of individual-level variables but not vice versa, rarely justify their implicit claims. Although it is difficult to specify the causal mechanism underlying a particular interaction effect, I show that there are cases where it is possible to do so. "
0,"This paper develops and evaluates a new model for predicting just rewards. The model produces point predictions for individual just rewards based on status characteristics and the expected value of a valued good. The equity model borrows from Berger and colleagues' (1998) reward expectations theory the ability to define different reward expectations. Drawing from Melamed and Walker's (2010) recent generalization of the mathematics of reward expectations theory, I illustrate how the model generates a continuous distribution of just rewards. The general model is applied to data from thirteen countries using the International Social Justice Project. The results illustrate the predictive power of the model using data from over 10,000 respondents. Implications and future directions are discussed. "
0,"Ethnography offers an opportunity for story-telling.  Yet, story-telling remains incomplete without an examination of the positionality of the story-teller.  The ethnographer or the story-teller is then a central component of the story.  Her own stories remain immersed in the narrative process.  In the course of this paper, I examine my own location as an ethnographer in a community known as Land Between the Rivers.  I draw upon Georg Simmel’s notion of the stranger to explore how the stranger-ethnographer carves out her place in her story.  I argue that the ethnographer frequently travels through her multiple “skins” as a sojourner in the narrative process and carries with her a part of the story that shapes her perception of the world [word count: 120]."
0,"While a substantial proportion of students delay entry into higher education, sociologists are only beginning to understand the consequences of this phenomenon for educational attainment. Previous studies have reported a negative relationship between delayed entry and degree completion, but they have not been able to explain it with a range of students' background characteristics. Results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1997 indicate that life course transitions, including work, marriage/cohabitation and parenthood, make a unique contribution to explaining this relationship. Adding life course transitions to the models that already control for a range of background characteristics helps to explain the negative relationship between delayed entry and degree completion. These findings have implications for studying educational success in higher education and understanding the process of educational attainment more broadly."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, industrial restructuring led to a marked increase in wage inequality. Women, however, were nor as negatively affected by declining, manufacturing employment because their pay was relatively low within the industry, and their already high representation in the service sector provided access to newly created opportunities. However, black and white women did not fare equally and the black-white wage gap more than doubled. As both black and white women increased their representation as professionals and managers, black women became more likely to earn low wages within these occupations. Black degree holders also lost ground as they were unable to keep pace with the remarkable gains made by white women degree holders. The growth in black-white wage inequality, then, was not due to black women's relegation to ""bad jobs."" Instead, as women increased their share of ""good jobs,"" white women disproportionately benefitted."

0,"An increasing share of the economy is organized around financial capitalism, where, in contrast to the past, capital market actors actively assert and manage their claims on wealth creation and distribution.  These new activities challenge prior assumptions of managerial capitalism found in the sociological and industrial relations literature.  In this paper, we focus on a set of pro-active intermediaries -- private equity funds –to illustrate new forms of wealth extraction and their implications for labor research.  We begin by examining the changes in the US regulatory environment that have allowed these financial intermediaries to emerge.  We then describe the prevailing private equity business model by drawing on case examples across different sectors of the economy; and we explain the implications of the business model for management and labor.  In the conclusion, we suggest several regulatory changes that could potentially limit the destructive outcomes of alternative investment activities."
0,"This paper uses the case of the Norse Greenlanders, who lived in Greenland from 985-c. 1450 during a period of significant climatic change, to explore the role of ideological rigidity  the inflexible attachment to a particular world view  as a constraint on human adaptation. Through an examination of the social and economic bases of Norse Greenland society, the emergence of a variety of stresses (both internally and externally generated) to that system and the reaction to them, the case suggests that mental models of the world channel the way a culture reacts to stress. Rather than abandoning those models as the stress continues to worsen, the culture may respond by elaborating and reinforcing the dysfunctional world view. Even at the maximum possible price, the death of the culture. Parallels between this societal level process and the dynamics of the smaller system disasters discussed by Perrow (1984) are explored."
0,"In the late 1980s, in what Harriet Friedman has termed the end of the second agricultural regime (Friedmann 1993), the United States experienced a crisis in agricultural exports.   At the same time, the Uruguay Round of the GATT was being negotiated to regulate agriculture.  This paper examines the strategies of two grain corporations, Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, as they adjusted to and shaped the shifting terrain. Agribusiness capital appears to have been split in its approach to these changes.  ADM supported the use of US government export programs to increase competitiveness, while Cargill was opposed to export programs and supported lower internal market prices.  This paper examines the underlying economic dynamics that drove these corporate strategies in the evolving regime.   The paper uses data from trade and financial journals from 1986 to 1993."

Using surveys and interviews with 77 belly dancers in the United States, this study shows that belly dance is spiritual for people who consider spirituality important in their lives, have belly danced for many years, rarely attend worship services, and are not affiliated with Judeo-Christian religions. Belly dance becomes spiritual when dancers olet goo and experience various connections. The dance itself and the environment in which one dances facilitate spiritual experiences. Implications for spirituality are discussed."
0,"In 1988, Judith Stacey posed the provocative question: ""Can there be a feminist ethnography?"" In doing so, she challenged widely held assumptions about feminist ethnography by pointing out that qualitative research methods do not necessarily mitigate the dangers of exploitation in research. Almost two decades later, the issues Stacey raised continue to receive considerable attention from feminist scholars. This article adds to this body of literature by examining the dynamics of reciprocity and positionality in research. Drawing from research conducted with Bosnian Muslim refugees, the author outlines three tensions she experienced and addresses how these tensions were related to her shifting and sometimes contradictory positionalities as a woman, a researcher, a friend, a graduate student, and as a person who was straddled between two classes. This is followed by a discussion about the lessons learned and the way the experiences shaped her current collaborative, community-based research project with Somali refugees."
0,"Many market-centered democracies have more comprehensive and generous family policies than the United States. While there is an assumed lack of public support for such policies, little research exists on Americans' family policy attitudes, especially in a comparative perspective. The authors examine the United States within the liberal welfare state framework, comparing it to nations with the greatest institutional, historical, and cultural similarities ( Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand). Using data from the 1994 and 2002 International Social Survey Program, the authors explore support for and determinants of paid maternity leave and financial benefits for childcare. Results show that despite common assumptions, Americans are as supportive and often more so than citizens in other liberal welfare states. However, Americans differ significantly according to sources of policy support. Specifically, the gender gap in policy preferences is larger in the United States than in other liberal welfare states. Conversely, there is a weaker relationship in the United States between liberal work/family attitudes and support of these policies. The results have implications for proponents of family policy and theoretical debates concerning gender, public opinion, and family policy."
0,"Early Chicago school thinkers linked crime to the disorganizing influx of Eastern European immigrants and black migrants from the South. Extending this to contemporary concerns, we use Census and Vital Statistics data to examine whether migration to ethnic enclaves among Latinos and blacks raises violence. It appears that when Latinos settle in their ethnic enclaves, violence in their communities declines. Contrary to Chicago school assertions, this improves economic conditions and strengthens group ties as the community mobilizes to receive newcomers. In contrast, such migration does not dampen violence in black communities. We discuss the implications of this for ecological theorizing."

We examined the extent of HIV/AIDS knowledge and the association of exposure to mass media among women in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) provides data for this paper. We found that media exposure (combined index of TV, radio, and newspaper) was a highly significant predictor of women’s knowledge about HIV and AIDS. Other significant predictors of HIV knowledge include women’s education, age, employment, and urban residence."
0,"This study tests cumulative disadvantage theory by examining the age-varying relationships between education, its mechanisms, and disease onset and survival duration. Using 20 years of panel data, I find that education is negatively associated with the accumulation of long-term behavioral and socio-economic risks, in addition to their well-established individual associations. I also find evidence that educational differences in the number of behavioral health-risks increases over time. In terms of their health consequences, education is positively related to both the age of onset and length of survival for hypertension and heart attack. For hypertension, I find that behavioral risks fully account for educations effect on disease onset; whereas for survival, social and economic risks explain a significant amount of the education effect. Although the accumulation of health risks added little to explaining educational differences in hypertension onset, I found that educational differences in survival are best explained by the number of social and economic risks accumulated over time. For heart attack, I find that social and economic risks exert a greater mediating effect on the relationship between education and incidence, but that neither the individual nor accumulated health-risk factors could account for educations effect on surviving after a heart attack."
0,"One in eight residents in the United States today is an immigrant (Camarota 2007) yet significant questions remain unanswered regarding the health status of our immigrant populations and how they utilize health care. Perhaps even more surprising, despite being part of the fastest growing immigrant group, Asian Pacific Americans remain one of the most poorly understood minorities in the United States. More specifically even though Korean Americans generally appear vulnerable to the increasing prevalence of diabetes we find that we suffer from lack of research on this important Asian subgroup as well as on Asian American incorporation and its relationship to diabetes detection and management. We suspect that Asian American populations such as Korean Americans are at a very high risk of undiagnosed diabetes and poor diabetic management because of their unique pattern of incorporation into the U.S. society as well as the low health insurance coverage rate. The low level of insured Korean Americans presents a concern since the lack of health insurance is a major impediment to health service utilization. Furthermore many aspects of immigrant incorporation in relation to health service utilization are still under-examined. This paper presents a literature review of immigrant health service utilization for diabetes as they relate to immigrant incorporation and we argue that it is vital to have more research on health service utilization for diabetic detection and management for Asian American subgroups such as Korean Americans."
0,"The availability of national data for young children on their beginning school experiences has fostered new insights into the structure of educational opportunities for students in U.S. schools.  Results from analyses of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS-K), reveal disparities in placement of boys and girls with similar achievement characteristics.  Boys, despite equal levels of cognitive achievement as girls, are overly represented in low reading groups and underrepresented in high reading groups.  This gender gap in placement is explained by teachers own ratings of boys reading skills as well as their rating of students social behaviors, such as externalizing problem behaviors and learning approaches.  These findings point to the sources of eventual and persistent gaps in reading performance."
0,"The red state-blue state characterization of American society geographically categorizes the U.S. into Republican and Democrat states, with the assumption that the gulf between the states is broad and deep in many issues and policies. Given this presumed division, this research examines three dimensions of environmentalism to determine if political party identification is indeed a useful predictor of environmentalism when taking into consideration a person's place of residence and several other social demographic influences. Data come from a 2003 phone survey of 606 residents in Nebraska. Nebraska provides a good test of how much political party identification matters in understanding environmentalism when the population is generally conservative, with traditional ties to extractive commodity production. The findings show that political party identification is significant in understanding environmentalism and that place of residence does not affect environmentalism. However, while the findings reveal that political party identification is an important predictor of environmentalism, both Republicans and Democrats show a relatively strong support for the environment."
0,"In 1975, federal marijuana decriminalization appeared to be right around the corner.  Presidential candidates for the 1976 election, including the eventual victor Jimmy Carter, endorsed the idea.  11 states had decriminalized marijuana and many more were considering relaxations of marijuana law.  The General Social Survey showed close to 30 percent support for outright legalization of marijuana. An article by William F. Buckley in National Review, calling for national decriminalization on limited-government grounds, was a bellwether of the broad support for drug law reform in the 1970s.  Yet federal-level marijuana decriminalization never occured - why?  The failure of decriminalization is most commonly attributed to conservative ascendence in government, an inhospitable change in public opinion, health concerns about drug use, and the mobilization of a conservative parents' movement.  I believe that existing explanations do not pay sufficient attention to the changing characterization of the marijuana user.  This paper analyzes news coverage from the period 1975-1979 to test the hypotheses that marijuana use was increasingly linked to children, to violent crime, to health problems and to broader social and generational strife.  The paper concludes by speculating on a relationship between the macrosociological conditions of the late 1970s and an increase in concern over marijuana use."
0,"Using data from the 2002 National Survey of the Changing Workforce, this article examines the effects of schedule control and job autonomy on two forms of work-home role blurring: receiving work-related contact outside of normal work hours and bringing work home. Schedule control is associated positively with the frequency of receiving contact and bringing work home, although those effects are stronger among men. Job autonomy is associated positively with contact among men only, but it is associated positively with bringing work home among both women and men. Schedule control and job autonomy also modify the association between these forms of role blurring and work-to-home conflict: (1) contact is associated positively with work-to-home conflict among individuals with low job autonomy; and (2) bringing work home is associated positively with work-to-home conflict among individuals with greater schedule control. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings for the linkages among gender, work conditions associated with control, and the work-home interface. Keywords: work-home balance, schedule control, job autonomy, flexibility, work-family interface."
0,"Getting married and becoming a parent are two of the most universal life transitions throughout history and across societies. Not surprisingly, a large body of literature documents how changes in family structures are associated with individuals well-being. Although it is well documented how marriage benefits individuals mental health, the effects of being a parent, however, is less understood. While several studies attempted to assess the relationship between having a child and well-being, their findings are inconsistent. The current study explores how being a parent is associated with womens psychological well-being over the life course to address these discrepancies. Additionally, we also estimate the long term effect of age at first birth on well-being to investigate how the association between parental status and well-being varies by the timing of transition to parenthood. Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 79 Cohort, our results indicate that parents are more likely to suffer from depression than those who are childless during young adulthood. However, having a child is no longer to be detrimental in mid life. We also found that the association between parenthood and well-being also varies by mothers age at first birth. We discuss implications of the results and acknowledge research limitations."
0,"Education and fertility (including childrearing) are foundational processes in societal metabolism, and the relationship between them can have profound, long-term effects on a variety of institutions, including the labor market, the family, (especially care for the elderly), and educational institutions themselves. In postindustrial countries, conventional wisdom holds that there is a strong inverse relationship between education and completed fertility, but this has not been carefully examined in recent decades, and the topic has been almost completely neglected for men. In this article, we address these core questions and relations, drawing on the Norwegian population registers for cohorts born 1940 to 1964. Among women, the relationship between completed fertility and educational level attained at age 39 has become substantially less negative. In all cohorts, better-educated women have later first births and remain childless more often than do the less educated. The negative effect of education on higher-order birth rates net of the impact of later motherhood has, however, disappeared. Family-friendly ideologies and policies, including better access to high-quality daycare, are likely the engine behind this shift. Among men, a positive relationship has emerged: the better educated become fathers later than others, but fewer remain childless, and there has been an increasingly stimulating effect of education on second- and third-birth rates. We discuss these sex differences in light of the persistent differences between mothers' and fathers' roles."
0,"This paper utilizes empirical study of second and 1.5 generation Latin American in Madrid to develop the notion of receiving society transnationalism, or transnational connections that bypass the home society and instead link different receiving societies.  It identifies the existence of such connections; outlines the means and process of maintaining such transnational links; and highlights their implications for individuals’ perspectives on their current circumstance, or their bifocal orientations.   Overall, it shows that receiving society transnationalism can prove significant to immigrant-origin individuals, and it can provide an additional frame of reference beyond the home society from which individuals evaluate their lives and prospects in their current area of residence.  It contributes to the field of transnational studies principally through its focus on connections between receiving societies rather than home society-receiving society connections – a means of transnational contact largely unexplored in previous transnationalism literature.  It also contributes to the literature through its focus on the second generation – a group understudied relative to the first generation in transnationalism research, but of great significance for the shape and implications of long-standing transnational ties, and of particular relevance to the phenomenon of receiving society transnationalism."
0,"U.S. Hispanics experience health disparities that are in part socially determined. This paper explores the connections between health and residential segregation for Hispanics in metropolitan America. I conduct a multivariate analysis combining individual-level health survey data on Hispanics from the 1997-2002 Urban Institute National Survey of America’s Families with metropolitan area-level residential segregation scores from Census 2000. My primary research question is: What is the role of residential segregation in shaping the health disparities of U.S. Hispanics? In addition, I explore differences in the segregation/health relationship between U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics. I find that segregation from whites has a significant negative effect on health status for Hispanics even after accounting for compositional factors such as poverty status and education. Consistent with spatial assimilation theory, however, much of the observed negative effects of segregation on health are overshadowed by individual-level socioeconomic characteristics. Despite my prediction that health outcomes for foreign-born Hispanics may actually improve with higher segregation, nativity does not significantly alter the link between health and segregation among Hispanics. This research is part of a broader project and highlights the importance of examining residential segregation as a social determinant of health for Hispanics and key Hispanic subgroups."
0,"Numerous researchers have documented the multiple ways in which women are disadvantaged in the workplace.  Scant research, however, has investigated gender stratification in jobs in the sex industry.  Drawing on qualitative data collected in the mainstream pornography industry, this paper describes gender differences in the careers of X-rated actresses and actors.  Several patterns noted in other occupations are present in porn work, including more opportunities for advancement for men, greater career longevity for actors, and differential treatment of workers influenced by gender expectations.   However, unlike other occupations, actresses earn higher wages than their male coworkers, and have more opportunities to increase their overall earnings within the sex industry.  These gender differences are compared to other types of service work."
0,"A popular perception is that immigration causes higher crime rates. Yet, historical and contemporary research finds that at the individual level, immigrants are not more inclined to commit crime than the native born. Knowledge of the macro-level relationship between immigration and crime, however, is characterized by important gaps. Most notably, despite the fact that immigration is a macro-level social process that unfolds over time, longitudinal macro-level research on the immigration-crime nexus is virtually nonexistent. Moreover, while several theoretical perspectives posit sound reasons why over-time changes in immigration could result in higher or lower crime rates, we currently know little about the veracity of these arguments. To address these issues, this study investigates the longitudinal relationship between immigration and violent crime across U. S. cities and provides the first empirical assessment of theoretical perspectives that offer explanations of that relationship. Findings support the argument that immigration lowers violent crime rates by bolstering intact (two-parent) family structures."
0,"Multitasking can be an important coping strategy used by working parents for dealing with the time squeeze. We use the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) combined with survey data drawn from the 500 Family Study, a study of middle-class dual-earner families, to examine the prevalence of multitasking and its consequences for the emotional well-being and functioning of parents. The ESM provides a unique opportunity for examining real-time activities and emotional states as they occur in their natural setting. We find that on average parents multitask more than half of their waking time, and that mothers are substantially more likely to multitask than fathers. Multitasking adds 9 hours of activities a day for fathers and almost 10 hours for mothers. Mothers are also more likely to engage in housework and childcare activities while multitasking, compared to fathers who are more likely to engage in a work activity while multitasking. Findings from Hierarchical Linear Models further reveal that whereas both mothers and fathers report feeling more productive when they multitask, for mothers multitasking is also associated with increased negative affect. Overall, the results lend support to our hypothesis that multitasking constitutes an important source of gender inequality among working families."
0,"We develop and test a new hypothesis about how the race of a college freshman's roommate affects the racial composition of the student's ego network. Together, three principles of social structure proximity, homophily, and transitivity logically imply that college students assigned a roommate of a given race will have more friends (other than their roommate) of that race than will students assigned a roommate not of that race. A test with data collected from 195 white freshmen at Stanford University in the spring of 2002 supports this prediction. Our analysis advances earlier work by predicting and providing evidence of race-specific effects: While students assigned a different-race roommate of a given race have more friends (other than their roommate) of their roommate's race, they do not have more different-race friends not of their roommate's race.

0,"Associations with a professional staff but no members (nonmembership advocacy organizations, or NMAOs) are the subject of lively debate. Many argue that their proliferation has allowed an expansion of advocacy without an accompanying growth in civic engagement. This article asks if there has been significant recent growth of NMAOs and if those organizations have displaced membership advocacy organizations (MAOs). The authors find no evidence for a proportional increase of NMAOs since the 1960s. Further, among all organizations in three populations-peace, women's issues, and human rights-NMAOs have not displaced MAOs. In particular, the authors find that MAO density shapes NMAO founding, as membership groups provide a base for professional advocacy These findings challenge the notion that U.S. civic life has undergone a systemic transformation away from organizational forms that promote civic engagement."
0,"Recent studies have sparked lively debates about White working class voting in the U.S. On one hand, there is evidence that the White working class has shifted to vote Republican, and on the other hand, there is evidence that the White working class continues to vote Democratic. Using the American National Elections Studies (ANES), we examine 32 years of presidential election results (1972-2004). We utilize theoretically justifiable measures of routine white collar, skilled and unskilled workers, which we then combine into broad and restricted measures of the White working class. Also, we distinguish between the male and female White working class and consider a variety of other predictors of vote choice. We scrutinize the entire period as a whole, each election year individually, and then concentrate on the 1996-2004 elections. In the entire period, the odds that White Working class men voted Republican were greater by a factor of about 1.35. By contrast, White working class women were not significantly different from the electorate. Yet, this conceals temporal variation. Although the White working class was more Republican than the general electorate in 1972 and 1984, and more Democratic in 1976, the White working class generally was consistent with the electorate through 1992. Since 1996, there has been a sharp divergence between the male and female White working class. Men very strongly supported Republicans 1996-2004, while there is some evidence women supported Democrats in 1996 and 2004 (but not 2000). From 1996-2004, the odds White working class men voted Republican were greater by a factor of about 2.0. These patterns are not confined to the South and hold despite controls for a variety of predictors of vote choice. "
0,"This poster presentation is a collaborative project that examines environmental justice issues in San Antonio and the Texas-Mexico borderlands through investigation of regulatory policy and procedures and through participant observation and interviews in conjunction with grassroots organizing and with EPA and customs and other regulatory agents. The poster consists of information presented through photographic documentation of environmental justice violations, graphics that show cost analysis for various means of disposal or storage of hazardous waste, and multimedia (including video clips of cultural and environmental sites on San Antonios Southside and an environmental justice activist roundtable). Photographic and graphic images documenting and demonstrating environmental issues and quotations from activists, regulatory agents and others involved in various aspects of the regions environmental justice issues illustrate the complexity of the present situation. As student researchers and residents of one of the contaminated areas, our work educates our families and communities about the health problems their neighbors are facing; it exposes some of the shortcomings of the institutions, which should be serving us as residents.  We also hope to bring it to a wider, national audience, who is largely unaware of social and environmental conditions in this region. We hope our work helps generate solutions, which will provide safe and healthy neighborhoods to live in, in this culturally rich, but often economically neglected part of the nation. This poster is distinctive in its accessible illustration of environmental problems affecting borderland communities gathered from a spectrum of involved parties."
0,"Return migration, among both international and domestic migrants, is an important aspect of the migration process.  However, the features of the migrant experience that that serve to consolidate settlement or facilitate return remain elusive.  We address the question of settlement versus return among a population of rural-to-urban migrants who originate from Nang Rong district in northeastern Thailand.  Our central research question is whether social capital influences migrants decisions to settle or return. Using a longitudinal design and a multinomial logistic regression technique we compare migrants residential status in 1994 and 2000 to determine if they have settled in the urban destination or returned to a rural origin village.  Our measurement of social capital is direct, indicating the presence and strength of migrants social ties to persons in the destination who can provide assistance in times of needby lending money or helping to find employment.  We find that urban Thai migrants differ markedly in their access to social support.  We also find that net of socioeconomic status, household composition, duration of stay, and other migrant characteristics, access to social support in the destination consolidates the settlement of rural migrants in urban areas.  These findings suggest that among migrants moving into Thailands vast and growing urban centers, those who become strongly connected to others in the destination through ties of social support are more likely to settle and become long-term urban dwellers."
0,"Research on the cycle of addiction has shown that addict lifestyles are incredibly hard to break away from.  More recent advances have investigated whether observed changes in behavior are the result of differing propensities to engage in behavior or whether the intervention of social factors external to the individual are associated with change, net of underlying propensities. This paper examines the long term effects (42 months follow up) of two Therapeutic Community (TC) drug treatment programs (KEY and CREST) on the relapse to drug use for drug-involved offenders while controlling for demographic characteristics and underlying propensities to use drugs. The results indicate that present drug use for the participants in the TC programs is significantly lower compared to those not involved in the programs. Theoretical considerations and policy implications are addressed."
0,"Race scholars and antiracist activists disagree about what constitutes white antiracism, and how to produce it.  From ethnographic research among progressive race workshop trainers, I examine methodologies of white transformation.  Race trainers who otherwise differ from each other philosophically and methodologically share the belief that cultivating white interest-convergence with antiracism is a necessary element in the production of sustainable white antiracism. In this paper I discuss workshop approaches to building interest-convergence, and suggest that its significance across racial projects indicates that it is an important element of a post-Civil Rights antiracist master frame."
0,"This study examines the consequences for psychological well-being of marital stability and change over the five-year period between the two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. We develop and test the following hypotheses: (1) those who divorce or separate experience declines in psychological well-being compared to those who remain married; (2) among those unhappy with their marriage, those who divorce or separate see improvements in psychological well-being, especially if they remarry, compared to those who remain married to the same person; (3) psychological well-being declines in the first year or two following the end of the marriage and then improves to previous levels: (4) women experience greater improvements in psychological well-being from leaving an unhappy marriage than do men. We find strong and consistent support only for the first of these. "
0,"Some of the best-known social scientific theories of risks are those that have been elaborated by Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck. Although their arguments differ greatly, they agree in seeing the technologically induced risks of today's ""Risk Society"" as global-so pervasive that they transcend all socioeconomic as well as geopolitical and national boundaries. Most empirical work, however, provides greater support for a theoretical tradition exemplified by Short and Erikson. In this paper, we argue that many of the technological mega-risks described by Giddens and Beck as ""transcending"" social boundaries are better described as ""Titanic risks,"" referring not so much to their colossal impact as to the fact that-as was the case for the majority of the victims on the Titanic-actual risks are related to victims' socioeconomic as well as sociogeographic locations. Previous research has shown this to be the case with high-risk technologies, such as nuclear energy and weaponry, and also with localized ones, such as toxic waste disposal. This article illustrates that the same is true even for the most genuinely ""global"" risks of all, namely those associated with global climate disruption."
0,Does a racial earnings gap exist among individuals who come from similar childhood socioeconomic backgrounds? Is the racial earnings gap larger or smaller for those from higher or lower socioeconomic origins? This research addresses these questions by taking a counterfactual approach to estimating the residual racial pay gap between non-Hispanic black and white men from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth The findings indicate that the racial earnings gap is larger among those from lower-middle class and working class childhood backgrounds than among those from upper-middle class backgrounds for whom the racial pay gap is indistinguishable from zero Compared to their more advantaged counterparts black men from lower-middle and working class backgrounds have more difficulty rising above their socioeconomic origins relative to white men from similar social class backgrounds Racial earnings equality among those from upper-middle class backgrounds suggests that the high levels of racial inequality often observed among those with college and professional degrees may in fact reflect heterogeneous childhood socioeconomic backgrounds among the college educated backgrounds that continue to have an effect on earnings despite individual academic achievements 
0,"Relying on innovative extensions of both the routine activities (Osgood et al. 1996) and the social disorganization perspectives (Sampson et al. 1997), we test the hypothesis that unstructured socializing leads to increases in violent behavior within urban communities.  We also examine whether living within a high collective efficacy neighborhood reduces the impact of unstructured socializing on violence.  This paper uses three waves of data from the Project on Human Development in Chicagos Neighborhoods Community and Longitudinal Surveys. Results from a two level hierarchical liner models with robust standard error support our hypothesis, suggesting that dwelling within a high collective efficacy neighborhood attenuates the effect of unstructured socializing on violent behavior."
0,"The authors consider how uncertainty over protest occurrence shapes the strategic interaction between companies and activists. Analyzing Wal-Mart, the authors find support for their theory that companies respond to this uncertainty through a ""test for protest"" approach. In Wal-Mart's case, this consists of low-cost probes in the form of new store proposals. They then withdraw if they face protests, especially when those protests signal future problems. Wal-Mart is more likely to open stores that are particularly profitable, even if they are protested. This uncertainty-based account stands in sharp contrast to full-information models that characterize protests as rare miscalculations."
0,"The “Census moment” for the 2010 Census occurred at 11:59 PM on April 1, 2010.  This means that, ideally, all persons alive and living in the United States at that moment are included in the Census count, while any person not alive at that moment is excluded.  In reality, this goal is challenging to achieve.  Since the actual date of data collection often varies widely, it is possible that individuals are included, or excluded, in the count due to this discrepancy between the Census day and the date of data collection.In this paper, I explore how the Census Bureau addresses this issue specifically when dates of birth after Census day are encountered.  First, I describe the three methods of data collection (Self-administered questionnaires, enumerator administered questionnaires, and telephone questionnaire assistance/coverage follow-up operator administered questionnaires), and how dates of birth after Census day are addressed in each of these methods.  Next I explore related findings from the 2010 Census, including how many dates of birth after Census day were found in the 2010 Census data, how they were processed according to data collection method, and how this impacted the final Census count.  Finally, I discuss the performance of the new procedures related to dates of birth after Census day that were implemented in the 2010 Census, along with implications for moving forward into future Censuses."
0,"Using ethnographic and social science survey methods, the formation of social networks among the socio-economically disadvantaged students of the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) at Barnard College were examined in an effort to determine the effects of the types of networks formed by these students on post-graduate job attainment and their opportunity to achieve upward mobility through their network usage. It was found that the social networks of these students tend to be HEOP focused, but that the class disadvantage of these networks do not negatively affect their employment prospects as these students tend to use their more advantaged weak ties in the job search. It was further found that the type of social tie used by the HEOP student was dependent on the monetary nature of the objective that was to be achieved through network usage. Among the sample, strong ties were used to obtain non-monetarily beneficial objectives, like housing, while weak ties were used to obtain monetarily beneficial objectives, such as employment. It is argued that there is a strong correlation between this differential network usage, the SES of the user, and the objective of network usage. It is therefore suggested that weak ties theory be commodified so as to reflect the influence of class on network usage. This paper concludes by arguing that due to degree inflation and the utility of network usage on job attainment, programs such as HEOP are integral to providing opportunities for the upward mobility of high risk students in higher education."
0,"We examine the relational model of inequality using samples of employer-employee matched data from manufacturing plants in the United States and Japan. We argue that gender is a salient status characteristic in both the United States and Japan, but because of differences in gender politics, wage inequality will vary more across U.S. workplaces than Japanese workplaces. We find this claim to be supported, and then we model this variation as a function of exploitation and opportunity hoarding processes. Women's exclusion from high-wage plants and gender-linked claims-making resources help to explain between and within plant wage variation in U.S. workplaces. In Japan, where gender distinctions were less locally contested, access to lifetime employment and gender differences in labor supply generate local gender wage gaps. This paper provides evidence on the utility of relational inequality theory and an empirical strategy to observe the exploitation and opportunity hoarding mechanisms."
0,"Population aging, increase of immigrants, and mounting health care costs have become major issues in the United States.  To cope with public health challenges given as an outcome of combination of increased immigration and population aging, understanding of the immigrant health would be critical. Most existent studies analyzed the relationship between immigration incidents and health status, and concluded that immigrants were healthier than U.S.-born counterparts.  We investigate, drawing longitudinal data from two panels (1996 and 2004) of the Health and Retirement Study, the dynamic relationship between the immigration process and health declining process by aging, by examining whether and how the cumulative effects of immigration experience affect womens health decline process in later life.  Our findings revealed that foreign-born women experienced significantly greater decline with the subjective health and increase in ADL limitations, compared to U.S.-born counterparts.  Our results from interaction models illustrated that education, wealth, marriage, and health insurance that benefit to health for U.S.-born women are, in general, less beneficial to moderate foreign-born womens health decline, and immigrants women are more vulnerable than U.S. born women to adverse socio-economic changes, such as becoming widowed and reducing assets."
0,"Abstract : Durkheim argued that moral constraints are effective in as much as they become part of consciousness.  This study extends that line of thinking to those who may have lost awareness of religious moral restraint. We investigated relationships between cognition, religiousness, and conflict between nursing home residents and other residents, staff and family. We used a probability sample of 1802 residents from 270 nursing homes in the United States. Church attendance prior to nursing home admission, preference for religious activities in the nursing home, and strength from faith measured religiousness. Conflict was regressed on cognitive impairment and each measure of religiousness while controlling for gender, race, depression, and functioning in activities of daily living. A significant interaction effect between cognitive impairment and church attendance indicated that those who attended church were slightly less likely to be involved in social conflict when cognitively intact, but much more likely to engage in conflict when moderately severely impaired than residents who had not attended church.  The finding suggests that conflict by church goers may have been restrained by moral internalization prior to institutionalization, but cognitive loss led to substantially increased conflict after institutionalization."
0,"This study uses logistic regression to analyze how strength of American identity influences Latino/a racial self identification with traditional and integration measures such as discrimination and skin color. These integration measures are not considered in Latino/a racial identity research using Census data that focuses on traditional measures such as socioeconomic status and education.  The primary hypothesis of the analysis is that those Latino/as who report seeing themselves strongly as American are more likely to choose “white” than “some other race” as their racial identity. The secondary hypothesis states that those Latino/as with darker skin tones and higher reports of discrimination will also be more likely to choose “some other race” than those Latino/as with lighter skin tones and no reports of discrimination. This is due to the concept that in America historically, only those considered white were allowed to be citizens of the United States and therefore American. Additionally, the concept of being American is still closely linked as someone with European decent and European features holding white values regardless of citizenship statues."
0,"This article explores the national factors that predict bishops' votes on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council. Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions' legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT."
0,"This research explores white-black differences in adolescent heterosexual romantic involvement and how these differences are shaped by social context. We find that, parallel to patterns of marriage in adulthood, non-Hispanic white girls are more likely to be in a romantic relationship than African American girls. This is particularly true when we focus on heterosexual romantic relationships formed with schoolmates. Among boys, African Americans are more likely to be romantically involved than non-Hispanic whites. We investigate the contribution of two broad types of social-demographic factors to these race-ethnic differences, population composition and normative climate. We develop theory about why being a numerical minority should lead to lower levels of relationship formation, especially when interracial relationships are rare. Results support the population composition hypotheses, but not the idea that race-ethnic differences arise because of differences in normative climate."
0,"South America is the locus of several recent national experiments in leftward politics proclaiming “Another World is Possible.” But the new directions chartered by a range of national governments in the region since the early 2000s represent quite divergent political trajectories. This article uses evidence from case studies of Caracas and Buenos Aires, in comparison to the better-documented case of São Paulo, to highlight the deeply “urban” nature of politics in a variety of left-turn contexts where political discourses attach to multiple other scales even as political practice locates specifically in the city’s volatile terrain. These situations represent recombinant geographies of citizenship in the wake of neoliberalism because the issues of rights and belonging are central in each case, yet all manner of scales are invoked – and produced – in these squabbles over the city. Both state actors and variously positioned groups of citizens recombine assumed correspondences between who belongs where, and with what justification from where. In “another world,” so much politics is urban in its empirical terrain but the pitch of struggles and imaginations of belonging – and thus the kinds of citizenships forged in practice – are multiscalar and recombinant. As a result, despite broad strokes of a populism redux in South America, and an ostensible ideological compatibility with the right to the city, there is little evidence of any continentwide form or location of urban citizenship emerging; nor is there substantive validation of the right to the city in line with its original, revolutionary formulation."
0,"After the demise of the economic boom during the bubble economy, Japanese employment has changed dramatically in workplaces and at the policy level.  One of such changes is the emergence and rapid growth of the temporary help industry, and the increasing number of young women working as dispatched temporary workers.  Based on data acquired from participant observation and in-depth interviews, this paper examines how those women come to be temporary workers.  Empirically, I found out that many women voluntarily choose to become temps after abandoning their permanent jobs, and that this choice is shaped by options available based on the discourse of gender and work in Japan.  This preference ironically seems to have coincided with the efforts of labor flexibilization on the part of the Japanese government and corporations.  I argue that it is theoretically necessary to examine micro-level dynamics and practices such as workers subjectivities even though they seem to be shaped by macro forces such as globalization."
0,"The autonomy perspective of housework time predicts that wives' housework time falls steadily as their earnings rise, because wives use additional financial resources to outsource or forego time in housework. We argue, however, that wives' ability to reduce their housework varies by household task. That is, we expect that increases in wives' earnings will allow them to forego or outsource some tasks, but not others. As a result, we hypothesize more rapid declines in wives' housework time for low-earning wives as their earnings increase than for high-earning wives who have already stopped performing household tasks that are the easiest and cheapest to outsource or forego. Using fixed-effects models and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find considerable support for our hypothesis. We further conclude that past evidence that wives who out-earn their husbands spend additional time in housework to compensate for their gender-deviant success in the labor market is due to the failure to account for the non-linear relationship between wives' absolute earnings and their housework time.

0,"Are partnerships that begin as ""hookups,"" ""friends with benefits,"" or casual dating relationships less satisfying and rewarding than serious sexual involvements? This research tests whether selection, experience, or mediation processes affect associations between types of sexual involvement and relationship quality. Drawing on a sample of 642 urban adults, we estimated ordinary least squares and treatment-effects regressions examining associations among types of sexual involvement, joint investments, and relationship quality. The results indicated that sexual involvements in nonromantic and casual dating contexts were associated with lower relationship quality in comparison to serious contexts, but these effects were completely accounted for by selectivity. Controlling for joint investments did not mediate these selection effects. The findings support the notion that screening processes associated with sexual involvement have important implications for later relationship quality. "
0,"Does money flow from the top and lead to the homogenization of local activities, or can it be incorporated at the level of daily interaction in ways that lead to its differentiation and multiplication? In this paper, I argue that these questions describe different ends of a continuum, which hinges on the definition we give to the term local. Local has a territorial and social dimension: something is local when it has a position in space. Physical proximity is the realm in which Goffmans Interaction Order operates. However, something can be local to somebody when it is in the social vicinity of the observer: local has also a relational component. A primary source of variation in the dynamics of money is the extent to which money reproduces socially closed and geographically limited networks, or whether it bridges social and/or geographical distance. This paper argues that some of the conceptual antinomies in the debates over money derive from the limitations of the liberal theory against which they react, because liberals tended to see money as a tool to break both geographic and social closure. Through an investigation of the monetary debates that emerged in liberal Italy at the turn of the 20th century I show that the problem of the local effects of money was conceptualized as a transformation of the interaction order. Geographic location was specifically interpreted in relation to the interactional setting in which a new, bourgeois status order was being constructed."
0,"Using a sample of 42,329 respondents nested within 4254 Canadian urban neighborhoods, this study demonstrates the conceptual and empirical importance of making a distinction between neighborhood racial diversity and minority concentration. and examines how each is uniquely associated with trust. Our analysis shows that at a given level of racial minority concentration, Whites are more trusting when their minority neighbors are more evenly distributed across racial minority groups. Meanwhile, Whites are less trusting as the neighborhood share of racial minorities increases. Overall, the effect of racial minority concentration tends to prevail over that of racial diversity. "
0,"Research has found that the bond between humans and animals is associated with positive human health, particularly higher levels of emotional well-being and reduced levels of stress.  Our analyses explore whether pet owners have better physical health outcomes, and if so, whether the positive physical health benefits are explained by better health behaviors that result from having to take care of the pets physical needs.  For example, the need to regularly walk a dog may make dog owners more physically active and thus reduce their risk for certain health outcomes such as obesity.  We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample, and limited our analyses to those people living alone (n=2474) in order to isolate the effect of pet ownership to only those people who are the primary caretakers of the pet.  Results showed that pet owners, no matter what kind of pet they own, had more positive physical health outcomes when compared to non pet owners.  The positive health effects were largely reduced once sociodemographic variables such as age, socioeconomic status, and residential location were considered, but the effect of pet ownership was NOT mediated by whether one regularly walked a mile without stopping.  Therefore, we argue that the positive health effects of pet ownership are primarily the result of selection.  That is, healthier and more active people are more likely to own a pet.  The need to take care of a pet does not improve ones physical health by increasing their levels of active behaviors."
0,"There is a growing recognition that frameworks of political agency premised on the position of wage-laborers in capitalist production are no longer adequate to capture many of the most significant political struggles against neoliberal capitalism. Labor struggles have been joined and, in some places, overshadowed by social movements fighting against what Harvey has called “accumulation by dispossession.” Rural land has, in many countries such as India and China, become a major locus of such dispossession, bringing the state and metropolitan capitalists into direct confrontation with rural agriculturalists. In India, the last five years has seen a proliferation of such so-called “land wars” across the countryside, which are collectively mounting a serious challenge to neoliberal capitalism. However, this paper argues that existing social-science theories of political agency are inadequate for understanding the specificity of this politics of dispossession. Based on two years of ethnographic research on anti-dispossession movements across rural India, I argue that accumulation by dispossession creates a distinctive type of politics and try to illuminate its generic features and main sources of variation. I then draw conclusions about the broader political directions and alternatives to neoliberal capitalism emerging from these movements."
0,"Underage drinking among American youth is a growing public concern. However, while extensive research has identified individual level predictors of this phenomenon, few studies have theorized and tested the effect of structural social forces on children's and youths' alcohol consumption. In an attempt to address this gap, we study the effects of residential environments on children's and youths' underage drinking (while accounting for personality and familial processes). Integrating informal social control and opportunity explanations of deviance, we first suggest that while neighborhood collective efficacy prevents adolescents' underage drinking, individuals' access to local alcohol retail shops encourages such behavior. Focusing on the interactive effects of communal opportunities and controls, we then suggest that high presence of alcohol outlets and sales in the neighborhood is likely to increase youths' probability of alcohol consumption in the absence of communal mechanisms of informal social control. We test our theoretical model using the unprecedented data design available in the PHDCN. Results from a series of multilevel logit models with robust standard errors reveal partial support for our hypotheses; specifically, we find that alcohol sales in a given neighborhood increase adolescents' alcohol use. In addition, while the direct effect of collective efficacy is insignificantly related to children's and youths' alcohol consumption, our models suggest that it significantly attenuates the effect of local alcohol retailers and sales on underage drinking.

0,"Although more than 20,000 Americans are dying of gun annually, the U.S. still remains the country where one can own firearms at home most freely. What kinds of people support the private ownership of firearms? How has the trend changed? To answer these questions, this research conducted a regression and a cohort analyses with a longitudinal (repeated cross-sectional design) data set (1981-1998) available from the DDB-Needham Life Style Studies. The regression analysis found that brave people with overconfidence in their ability in fist fight tend to support the cause of private ownership of firearms. However, although ones confidence in fist fight is significantly and positively related with support for private ownership of firearms at the individual level, the cohort analysis showed that trends in those two variables do not necessarily move in the same direction at the ecological (cohort) level. Further, the regression analysis also found that the property crime rate in each survey year was significantly and negatively associated with the respondents support for private ownership of firearms."
0,"In this paper, I explore the common assumption that income influences which students engage in formal preparation for college entrance exams (e.g., SAT tutoring). Though there is a widespread impression that richer students gain unfair advantages by engaging in test prep, or coaching, that poorer students cannot afford, there is little academic research that substantiates this claim. Using data from the National Household Education Survey (2003), I test whether there are income differences in test prep. Finding that there are, I then attempt to explain why those differences exist. I investigate student demographics, class/neighborhood indicators, family educational background, race, parent expectations, parent involvement, student qualifications, and student activities as possible explanations. Consistent with the findings of Lareau on concerted cultivation, I find that parent expectations and student activities are the most important explanations for income differences in test prep. I also call for more specificity in survey questions about test prep: broad survey questions might obscure important distinctions among students who do different types of prep."
0,"In this article, we test whether or not positive/negative sanctioning increases religious behavior. Using data from the 1998 congregational module of the General Social Survey we find that, net of other predictors, immediate positive sanctions (receiving help from the congregation) and immediate negative sanctions (receiving criticism from the congregation) significantly increase the amount of money given by respondents to religious organizations. Our results also indicate that sanctions promised in the future (belief in Heaven and belief in Hell) have little to no effect on religious giving. Furthermore, we find that immediate positive and negative sanctions as well as future negative sanctions predict greater participation in religious organizations, while future positive sanctions show no such effects. The results are discussed in the context of the emerging trend of waning religious involvement in the contemporary United States."
0,"The Human Genome Project (HGP) has sparked an increase in discussion of genetics by popular media, there has been little analysis of the gendered character of this discourse despite feminist traditions scrutinizing the masculine discourses of science and medicine.  Part of a larger project to fill this gap, this paper analyzes major newspaper articles, popular press and peer-reviewed journal accounts of the HGP from 1990 to 2005, with a particular focus on two of its chief proponents, Francis Collins and Craig Venter. Ostensibly gender-neutral popular discourse about the HGP, often framed as a rivalry between these two men, is deeply gendered and replete with gender-laden discourse.  Central to this gendered discourse are traditional notions of masculinity based on science as a field of honor, filled with risk-taking gambles and a quest for dominance over nature.  Simultaneously, this discourse renders women exclusively in terms of sexuality and reproduction.  Interwoven with these notions of gender and masculinity are ideas about race (specifically, whiteness) and class (the pursuit of wealth) and American hegemony. This popular scientific discourse reproduces biologically determined notions of race and gender, while it also meets demands of global capitalism and contributes to the historically specific shaping of gendered knowledge."
0,"This study explores time trends in public trust in science in the United States from 1974 to 2010. More precisely, I test Mooney's (2005) claim that conservatives in the United States have become increasingly distrustful of science. Using data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Survey, I examine group differences in trust in science and group-specific change in these attitudes over time. Results show that group differences in trust in science are largely stable over the period, except for respondents identifying as conservative. Conservatives began the period with the highest trust in science, relative to liberals and moderates, and ended the period with the lowest. The patterns for science are also unique when compared to public trust in other secular institutions. Results show enduring differences in trust in science by social class, ethnicity, gender, church attendance, and region. I explore the implications of these findings, specifically, the potential for political divisions to emerge over the cultural authority of science and the social role of experts in the formation of public policy."
0,"The ""interimperial"" field of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Pacific included Spain, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States, consisting not only of competition over land and trade claims but also of exchanges of imperialist technologies, centrally including violence. The United States was also involved in an ""intraimperial field"" of metropole and colony, in which imperialist violence was a key factor. In taking the Philippines as a colony, the United States developed an accompanying discourse of exceptionalism dubbed as ""benevolent assimilation,"" differentiating its empire from that of other empires. That the U.S. required an exceptionalist discourse to legitimate its imperialist endeavors was a result of its nationalist historical-narrative claiming democratic traditions as fundamental to its existence as a nation-state. Along with this statist narrative was an accompanying cultural narrative of an evangelical process of ""civilization"" and progress that white Americans would bring to racialized groups. In this paper, I lay out the interimperial and intraimperial fields of U.S. imperialism, following the transnational path of imperialist violence rendered on racialized bodies, those ""exceptionally"" included through their exclusions. Tracing imperialist violence through these fields, I look at the nationalist cultural conditions that made this violence and its corresponding opposition possible."
0,"Occupations with a greater share of females pay less than those with a lower share, controlling for education and skill. This association is explained by two dominant views: devaluation and queuing. The former views the pay offered in art occupation to affect its female proportion, due to employers' preference for men-a gendered labor queue. The latter argues that the proportion of females in an occupation affects pay, owing to devaluation of work done by women. Only a few past studies used longitudinal data, which is needed to test the theories. We use fixed-effects models, thus controlling for stable characteristics Of Occupations, and U.S. Census data from 1950 through 2000. We find substantial evidence for the devaluation view, but only scant evidence for the queuing view."
0,"While a growing body of research indicates the severe ecological and social costs of biofuel production worldwide, the U.S. government continues to promote the expansion of this fuel sector. This presents a significant puzzle and contradiction in light of claims by Ecological Modernization theorists that an ecological rationality (reflexive modernity) will come to supplement economic rationalities in the practices of state and economic actors in liberal democracies. Recent Congressional testimony regarding biofuels offers a strategic research site for sociological investigation into the extent (if any) of an ecological rationality penetrating the rhetoric, discourse and procedure of Congressional hearings on biofuels, as well as insight into the political process of energy policy-formation. Ecological Modernization theory is contrasted here to Treadmill of Production theory on the basis of an original empirical analysis of Congressional testimony during the formative legislative period with regards to biofuels. This original empirical research is intended to add to the debates over biofuels, contribute to our understanding of ‘alternative’ energy policy-formation, and further theoretical developments within environmental sociology relevant to these debates."

0,"Bourdieu's influential notion of habitus has been found to be a useful analytic construct by a wide variety of researchers across various disciplines and subfields in the social sciences.  However, the notion of habitus has been taken to task by several critics for being overly weighted toward stasis and reproduction.  In this chapter I argue that a constructive way to address these critiques is to recast the notion of habitus by abandoning the older Piagetian language of ""cognitive structures"" in favor of a new set of concepts and formal-representational tools that have recently emerged in artificial intelligence, cognitive science and developmental psychology. This new  ""dynamic embodiment"" framework, allow us to retain the most important features of the habitus concept (e.g. the preservation of modes of perception and appreciation and action that result from previous exposure to correlated experiences) while also accounting for the most obvious ways in which implicit skill is manifested in social settings: through the time-constrained, context-sensitive adaptation to a constantly changing situational landscape, in which both previous adaptive history and immediate adjustments to the perceive present play a role in generating action."
0,"The goal of my study was to investigate women’s tattooing in a phenomenological way, and to go in-depth into a ‘handful’ of cases with the purpose of discussing tattooed women’s daily lives and experiences.  The main purpose of this study was to contribute a work to the scholarly literature about women’s tattooing as well as tattooed women’s (possible) dislike for (certain) tattoos.  Open-ended conversational interviews and feminist phenomenological methods together shed light on how tattooed women define ‘tattoos’ as well as the reasons that tattooed women may and do acquire as well as remove tattoos.  Also discussed are the types or forms of tattoos that may be or are regretful and why."
0,"Following Rehers (1998) seminal paper on family ties in western Europe, the perspective that family solidarity patterns are divided along the lines of an individualistic north and a familialistic south has dominated the research literature. We challenge this view and address variability in intergenerational family solidarity within and across countries. Using multiple dimensions of intergenerational solidarity drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we develop a typology of late-life families which is robust across northern, central and southern regions. The four types are (a) descending familialism: living nearby, frequent contact, endorsement of family obligation norms, and primarily help in kind from parents to children, (b) ascending familialism: living nearby, frequent contact, endorsement of family obligation norms, and primarily help in kind from children to parents, (c) supportive at distance: not living nearby, frequent contact, refutation of family obligation norms, and primarily financial transfers from parents to adult children, (d) autonomous: not living nearby, little contact, refutation of family obligation norms, and few support exchanges. The four types are prevalent in each European country, though their distribution differs. Our findings suggest that scholars should move beyond the idea that a particular country is best characterized by a single dominant type of late-life family. Sociodemographic differentials in family type follow predictable patterns, underscoring the validity of the developed typology."
0,"Many studies on family solidarity emphasize the importance of norms for understanding why people help family members. The question of where kinship norms come from, however, is underanalyzed. This study examines the influence of the family of origin oil the development of kinship norms using models of sibling resemblance estimated on a large-scale multi-actor survey. Analyses show that a quarter of the variance in filial norms can be explained by the family of origin. The family of origin has a smaller influence on normative obligations toward children and other family. Part of the total family influence can be explained by the filial norms that parents have themselves and the emphasis parents put oil obedience. Family background characteristics are less important.

Here the authors argue that the distinction between home and work and between public and private sphere is currently undergoing a steady erosion as a result of a variety of economic, technological and social forces. Drawing upon a wide diversity of research materials, they suggest that the intrusion of the consumer market and the contradictory trends towards commodification and decommodification have important implications for rethinking the class, gender, and community dynamics of public/private life in the West and in the emerging economies."
0,"Through large political contributions, corporations possess disproportionate influence over political candidates- and therefore legislation- in the United States government.  Interlocking directorates, where one person sits on the board of two or more corporations, have been examined both for their network properties and to question the presence of an elite or inner circle of businessmen in the American corporate world.  What has been missing is an analysis of the corporate political donations made with reference to the interlock networks.  The correlation of donation practices with mutual board members would signify some degree of conscious collusion among these actors or an unconscious consensus to support those politicians who aid business.  My work examines the structure of the network of corporate interlocks in Fortune 1000 companies in 1990, 2000, and 2004, and compares them with campaign donations made by each company in that year.  The motivating question is whether proximity in the interlock network is correlated with similar in donation practices, defined here as donating similar portions of overall funds to the same politicians.  This comparison permits a test of the elitist and pluralist theories of the American party system currently debated in Political Sociology, and aptly uses network methodology to test the existence of an elite group of board members in control of a large percentage of corporate political donations."
0,"Marx's theory must be visualized as an attempt to provide a framework for tracking the relationship between ""quantitative"" (economic) and ""qualitative"" (political, social, and cultural) changes, as a field of tensions, or force-field, that never quite is the same at any two moments in time.  Grasping this nexus requires a theoretical and cognitive framework that departs from ingrained habits and underlying patterns of ""thinking""; we must presume that the most basic assumptions we inherit from earlier social scientists may be highly problematic, as they could function as unintended mechanisms to conceal the most conspicuous paradox of advanced capitalist societies--that increasing societal wealth does not translate, inevitably, into decreasing social inequality.  Departing from ingrained practices is eminently difficult, as our selves are bound up with these practices to a far greater degree than educational systems are equipped to convey to students, and Marx's critiques of alienation and commodity fetishism must be viewed as addressing precisely this issue.  His theory was not so much about the ""objective possibility of overcoming reification"" (to paraphrase Lukács), as about the growing difficulties to overcome the effects of the capitalist mode of production as reflected in politics, culture, and society, with each successive mediation--alienation, commodity fetishism, and reification--re-patterning the thoughts, desires, and actions of subsequent generations, making it ever more difficult to conceive of adequate means for analyzing this condition.  This take on Marx's theory, and its importance for analyzing today's world, has immediate implications for how to critique the thrust of sociological theory."
0,"This study compares the impact of multiple forms of crime- related media across white, Latino, and African American respondents on their perception of crime risk in their neighborhoods and fear of crime, using a state-wide survey of 3,712 Californians. The findings indicate some difference in the impact of crime-related media by different media forms and across race/ethnic groups. Consumption of local television news significantly elevated perceptions of risk and fear of crime for all groups. Crime-based reality programs produced equivalent fear, but the effects of newspaper and crime drama consumption were more variable. Realistic television content about crime was most influential on viewers' perceptions of and responses to crime than fictional accounts or newspapers."
0,"Sexism is a recurrent part of women's everyday lives. One understudied area within gender scholarship is the content and implications of sexist humor as a form of sexism. In this article, we explore the sexist content of 153 Internet jokes. Our analysis demonstrates that sexist jokes offer portrayals of misogyny that serve many functions, some of which include the sexual objectification of women, devaluation of their personal and professional abilities, and support of violence against women. Implications of such humor are discussed as well as future research possibilities in this area."
0,"This paper examines global patterns of trade in vaccines and the relationship between a countrys position within the hierarchical structure of the trade network and ability to provide adequate immunization services to its populace. I examine the configuration of international trade in vaccines in 1996 and 2004 to discern stable patterns as well as changes in the hierarchical structure of these networks of trade, and further focus on the relationship between structural position of the state within these networks and changes in vaccination rates. By employing network analysis techniques, I examine various patterns of relationships between a countrys position within the hierarchy of the world system and the changes in immunization rates between 1996 and 2004. Such an examination reveals tensions and fissures between the state as an actor in the geo-politics of trade in pharmaceutical products, and a provider of basic health services to its citizenry. I further focus on the disjunction between the market imperative driving growth or viability of the pharmaceutical industry and the quintessential role of the state as the provider of public goods and services."
0,"Seemingly in an instant, the red ribbon established itself within the global collective consciousness as the symbol of AIDS.  To truly understand the sociological implications of this cultural icon, I dissect the various ways in which the symbol is adapted and adopted from its origins in the New York art world, to its global prominence within the field of public health, to its redeployment in local communities outside of the U.S., where the ribbon comes to have distinct, even surprising, meanings for different audiences.  Despite its current position as the symbol of AIDS, I want to argue that the rise of the red ribbon was not inevitable, and that in certain contexts the red ribbon has little cultural power at all.  This variation, I argue, stems from tensions between resonance and institutionalizationtwo core dimensions of cultural power.  By tracing the origins of the red ribbon I identify those cultural mechanisms that enhanced or diminished the ribbons cultural power."
0,"A growing body of research investigates the possible relationships between religion and mental health. After developing a series of arguments linking various aspects of religion with anxiety and tranquility, we test relevant hypotheses using data from the 1996 General Social Survey. Results show that frequency of religious attendance and the belief in an afterlife are inversely associated with feelings of anxiety and positively associated with feelings of tranquility. However, frequency of prayer has no direct association with either outcome. Strong beliefs in the pervasiveness of sin are positively linked with anxiety but unrelated to tranquility. Finally, belief in an afterlife and frequency of prayer buffer the adverse effects of poor health and financial decline on anxiety. Implications of these findings are discussed along with study limitations and promising directions for future research. "
0,"This paper takes up Giorgio Agamben’s argument regarding the production of sovereign state power, and attempts to supplement it with insights from work done on practices of signification. Particular attention is paid to Agamben’s assertion that sovereignty is a power which neither stands fully inside the normal situation nor the exception, but is able to decide on the boundary between the two, and as such, perpetuates a zone of indistinction. My argument is that if, as Agamben suggests, it is true that in such a zone, equivocation about what is legitimate and what is law is infinitely possible, and this equivocation is central to the perpetuation of sovereign power, then it is crucially important to pay attention to representations deployed by the state. By this logic, representations, which communicate the normal situation and the exception, should be instrumental to sovereign power. Moreover, if through representational practice, certain social groups, in particular contexts, become implicated in spaces where the rule is said to be legitimately suspended, while others remain ostensibly within the normal situation, then one is afforded the insight that practices of sovereignty may in fact be behind practices of ‘othering.’"
0,"The Catholic Church has had a strong influence on the Chilean legal and social landscape in ways that have adversely affected victims of intimate partner violence; e.g., it succeeded until just five years ago in blocking efforts to legalize divorce. At the same time, quantitative studies based on survey data from the United States and other countries show a generally favorable influence of religion on health and many other domains of life, including intimate partner violence. The present study explores the puzzle posed by these seemingly opposing macro- and micro-level forces. Results based on data from the 2005 Survey of Student Well-Being, a questionnaire on gender-based violence administered to students at a large public university in Chile, show that moderate or low levels of religiosity are associated with reduced vulnerability to violence, but high levels are not. This non-linearity sheds light on the puzzle, because at the macro level the religious views shaping Chile's legal and social environment have been extreme. "
0,"We study effects of explicit and implicit interethnic attitudes on ethnic discrimination in hiring. Unlike explicit attitudes, implicit attitudes are characterised by reduced controllability, awareness or intention. Effects of implicit interethnic attitudes on ethnic discrimination in the labour market remain under-researched. Moreover, previous experiments on the effects of explicit interethnic attitudes on discrimination have important drawbacks. We use data from a laboratory experiment (n = 272) consisting of an Implicit Association Test, a questionnaire and a recruitment test in which participants reviewed resumes representing fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience. Participants graded applicants and selected applicants for an interview. Results show that only explicit interethnic attitudes affect discrimination in grades, but both explicit and implicit interethnic attitudes increase discrimination in selection. "

0,"Much research has found that more religious youth are less likely to engage in riskier health-related behaviors. However, very little research has examined the role that religion may play in shaping the health-related behaviors of secular youth. There is reason to think that more and less religious youth may gain some health-related benefits from involvement with religious organizations through activities such as basketball and volunteering. Using two waves of data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, this study finds that involvement in religion-supported secular activities is associated with less alcohol use for all involved teens. The number of friends who belong to a religious youth group, in part, explains the relationship. Conversely, network overlap between parents and teens, the number of friends who drink or use drugs, and having an adult confidant from a religious group are not mechanisms that mediate the relationship.

Yet firms differ in their selection practices because firms of different sizes and ages have different economic and cultural resources.  Using data from the California wine industry, I examine how firms’ size, age, and work experience requirements affect firms’ selection of credentialed workers.  I find that firms are less likely to select credentialed workers as they grow and more likely to select credentialed workers as they require more work experience.  Moreover, that the negative effect of firm size is attenuated by work experience requirements."
0,"By analyzing the dynamics of family policy over the past three decades we can clearly identify a revolution within the OECD world. For the time period 1980-2008 we demonstrate that the Conservative welfare states of continental Europe, for a long time perceived as the most unlikely countries to implement ‘a modernised’ family policy, have indeed revolutionised their family policy approach, embarking on a trajectory towards a clear Swedenisation. Swedenisation can be understood as a process towards family policies encompassing comprehensive childcare services and (long) leave entitlements with high replacement rates. This analysis is based on Comparative Family Policy Database (Gauthier, 2010). Furthermore, we will identify the casual drivers of this process; among others we hypothesise that this revolution is largely due to: (1) a shift of public opinion towards the support of modernised family norms, (2) the role played by the employers, (3) the change in the political discourse, and (4) the degree of statism."
0,"The ""new immigration"", including substantial Asian immigration to North America, has revived questions about racial and ethnic minority group integration in predominantly European-origin societies. This study offers a new comparison of US and Canadian Asian integration using intermarriage as the indicator of integration. Results reveal more similarities than differences. Intermarriage variations by age, gender, education, immigrant generation, Asian ethnic group, and other sociodemographic characteristics are generally similar and consistent with previous research using US data. Multivariate results highlight similarities and the significance of immigrant generation, gender, and Asian ethnicity on Asian intermarriage in both countries. The main difference is lower overall Asian exogamy in Canada, reflecting country differences in the demographic history, composition, and distribution of the Asian populations. We conclude that exogamy is likely to continue to increase in both Canada and the US, and represents a key measure of the social integration of Asians in both countries. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Most studies of rape-law reform outcomes focus on single cases. We advance this literature by studying outcomes more systematically-leveraging new cross-national and longitudinal reform data-and showing that reform outcomes have both global and national determinants. Our exploratory analyses show three main findings: (1) Rape-law reforms are strongly associated with elevated police reporting between 1945 and 2005. (2) The strength of the association depends on domestic contexts. The association is stronger in countries characterized by individualism, women mobilization, wealth, and education; it is weaker in countries with greater democracy and police strength. (3) The strength of the association also depends on global contexts. It is stronger in countries with dense linkages to world society and weaker under conditions of global institutionalization, as widespread diffusion gives rise to both ceremony without substance (i.e., domestic rape-law reforms without subsequent increases in reporting) and substance without ceremony (increased police reporting without antecedent reforms). In multivariate regression analyses, rape-law reforms, women mobilization, and links, to world society all have positive and significant effects on police reporting. It appears that both global and domestic contexts-together and independently-importantly shape policy and practice."
0,"This research demonstrates how affect control theory and its computer program, Interact, can be used to develop empirically-grounded hypotheses regarding the connection between cultural labels and behaviors. Our demonstration focuses on propositions in the modified labeling theory of mental illness. According to the M LT, negative societal conceptions of the mentally ill become personally relevant upon diagnosis and damage psychiatric patients' self-concept. This, in turn, increases patients' use of three coping behaviors: concealing treatment history, educating others about mental illness and withdrawing from social interaction. We evaluate these propositions by analyzing data generated from Interact simulations that incorporate self-meaning data gathered from psychiatric patients. We produce six general principles about the way patients' stigma sentiments (evaluation, potency and activity associated with the cultural category ""a mentally ill person"") and diagnostic category (adjustment, affective, schizophrenic) jointly shape patients' predicted use of these coping behaviors."
0,"This article analyzes varying, inconsistent, representations of mestizaje (generally construed as racial or cultural mixing in the Americas) deriving from different historical settings and ideological frameworks. It particularly focuses on what I here term old mestizaje, summarized in the writings of Latin American intellectuals of the first quarter of the twentieth century, such as Mexican philosopher Jose Vasconcelos (The Cosmic Race); and new mestizaje, articulated in the works of such contemporary thinkers as Chicana writer Gloria Anzaldua (Borderlands/La Frontera: The NewMestiza). The center piece of the article is the contradictions and fractures between old and new discourses in terms of their underlying views of race, identity, and destiny. It examines the links of old mestizaje with essentialist, Social Darwinist, concepts, and the foundations of new mestizaje on a critical cultural studies paradigm. I propose that various aspects of old mestizaje infused hegemonic racial ideologies throughout Latin America and engendered a form of color blindness that obscured pervasive racial inequalities in the region."

It employs logistics regression to analyze data collected in a national phone survey, whereby 548 respondents were asked to mention a national or world event from the past 70 years that they considered to be important.  The results of this study reveal that race and gender interact to influence whether a respondent will mention September 11th as an important world event.  The results contribute to our understanding of how national security threats are perceived and prioritized by different sectors of society.   The findings complicate the popular understanding of September 11th as a nationally unifying event and investigate how race and gender impact the perceived importance of September 11th."

Using similar reports from previous years, the study identifies areas of progress and stagnation in the push for better representation of women, racial minorities, disabled people, trans people, and lesbians, gays & bisexuals.  The paper also discusses the qualitative character of many of these representations and compares how reality television works along these lines to the other two major genres of primetime programming: dramas and comedies."
0,Since 1970 the percentage of women incarcerated in U.S. prisons has risen from nearly 3 percent to almost 7 percent-more than doubling in less than 40 years. This article examines explanations for this phenomenon-concentrating on two: changes in the relative rates of arrest for females and males and sentencing reforms that were instituted during this period. The authors examine trends in female to male imprisonment rates from 1970 to 2008 across all fifty states using panel analysis. The only robust relationship they find is between the ratio of female to male incarceration rates and the ratio of female to male arrest rates for drug crimes. Sentencing reforms designed to limit the discretion of judges and those designed to limit the discretion of parole boards (the elimination of parole boards or truth in sentencing) are not related to changes in the ratio of female to male incarceration rates.
0,"Women and minority faculty members are less likely to be tenured, and oftentimes gender and race discrimination is at work. Standards, meritocracy and collegiality are often subjectively interpreted and manipulated. We analyze political and economic constraints as well as sociological factors to explain the phenomenon. The method we use is more qualitative than quantitative, but statistics are cited to support interpretive data derived from individual cases. The major contribution of this paper is to bring together a number of research findings and theories so that we can further understand a tough issue that has been paid much lip service to but largely left unattended."
0,"Legal sociologists have identified a long list of variables that predict severity in the disposition of criminal cases or, in terms of Donald Blacks theory, the quantity of penal law.  Even so, much variance remains unexplained suggesting that other predictors await discovery. We propose one such new independent variable: the conventionality of deviance. Conventionality is the frequency of the deviant behavior and is, we propose, negatively related to the severity of sanctioning. Thus, all else the same, where a particular crime is frequent, its sanctions ought to be mild; conversely, where a crime is infrequent, its sanctions ought to be severe.  We illustrate the hypothesis with data from two sources: a case study of the increased severity of homicide sanction in Victorian Britain and a hierarchical linear model analysis of convictions and imprisonment decisions for homicide in 33 U.S. counties."
0,"This research explicates the influence of social capital, across three institutional domains, on adolescent girls acceptance of nonmarital childbearing.  Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I specifically examine how Black and white adolescent girls access to social capital, through their integration into the social institutions of the family, education, and religion, shapes their willingness to consider nonmarital childbearing as an option for their futures.  Although a considerable body of research explicates the role of social capital in young persons acquisition of human capital, there is little research on the role of social capital in young persons acquisition of normative capital, or the adoption of normative attitudes that have the potential to enhance their life chances.  These findings suggest that, for African American girls, educational integration (a form of social capital) is associated with a greater acceptance of nonmarital childbearing, compared to whites.  In the domain of the family, African American girls integration tends to be associated with a significantly lesser acceptance of nonmarital childbearing, compared to whites.  Social policies that address the capacity of socializing institutions to deter adolescents from nonmarital childbearing must address the ways that their normative dynamics benefit some social groups, yet disadvantage others."

After discussing the conceptual linkages between credit and labor markets, I use data from the 1992 to 2008 waves of the Health and Retirement Study to examine the temporal patterning of retirement and debt behaviors. I rely on the longitudinal structure of the data to estimate the effects of debt accumulation on retirement behaviors, using alternative specifications to identify treatment and control groups. The findings suggest that debt accumulation in later life has a significant effect on decisions to remain in the workforce in later years. "
0,"Theorists agree that the risk of folding changes as organizations age, but there is little consensus as to the general form or generative processes of age-dependent mortality. This article investigates four such processes (maturation, senescence, legitimation and obsolescence), which have been taken as competing accounts. Using two analytical levers-elaborating on the time shapes of these processes and distinguishing aging of organizations from aging of their templates (designs)-this paper differentiates these four processes and tests them jointly. Analysis of mortality rates for American communes from 1609 through 1965 strongly supports the proposed effects of maturation and senescence at the organization level and legitimation at the level of organizational templates. Results give weaker evidence that obsolescence of templates influenced mortality and that environmental drift exacerbated obsolescence."
0,"We predict effects of behavior patterns and status on performance expectations and group inequality using an integrated theory developed by Fisek, Berger and Norman (1991). We next test those predictions using new experimental techniques we developed to control behavior patterns as independent variables. In a 10-condition experiment, predictions accounted for about 72 percent of variance in the data, with closer fit for women than for men. The gender difference may be related to features of the experiment, especially to the experimental design that counters cultural gender prescriptions in some conditions. We suggest ways to improve the experiment by more precisely separating behavior from inferred performance competence in later research. Applications include using behavior to reduce undesirable effects of status generalization."
0,"This paper provides an exploration into the effect of social uncertainty on actor behavior in networks of social exchange relations.  A theory for exchange under uncertainty is developed, arguing that as social uncertainty increases, exchange behavior is motivated by loss aversion and status quo bias.  Hypotheses generated by this theory are tested using experimental methods.  Forty groups of four exchange partners were randomly assigned to one of two different levels of uncertainty (low vs. high) and one of two different network structures (equal-power vs. strong-power).  Results of the experiment show that: commitment to exchange partners is higher under high-uncertainty relative to low-uncertainty, in equal-power networks but not strong-power networks.  The asymmetrical distribution of rewards in strong-power networks is reduced somewhat under high-uncertainty.  The quantity of resources exchanged across all relations is less under high-uncertainty relative to low-uncertainty, regardless of network structure.  Under high-uncertainty, in exchanges across imbalanced relationships, power-disadvantaged actors are more likely to defect in their exchanges than are power-advantaged actors.  These results suggest that network structure and level of uncertainty interact to generate variations in exchange behaviors.  Moreover, the results provide empirical support for the claim that as social uncertainty increases, loss aversion and status quo bias motivate exchange behavior.  Finally, the results reveal a tension between what may be viewed as positive micro-level outcomes (i.e. increased commitment and decreased resource asymmetry across relations) and negative macro-level outcomes (i.e. decreased productivity and exchange efficiency across the network as a whole) as actors exchange in networks under social uncertainty."
0,"This project examines the construction and transgression of boundaries in medical research using data collected during an ethnographic study at a brain-imaging lab. More precisely, this paper will address two simultaneous yet conflicting processes in medical research, measurement and the assembly of heterogonous ties. I will ague that both of these processes are crucial in the formation of a clinical population. While measurement through different tools, scales, graphs, meters serves to purify the object of medical research, namely the clinical population and thus helps maintain and police its boundaries by defining the normal and the pathological, the formation of heterogeneous networks results in the transgression of existing boundaries (Latour). I argue that the medical research lab is one of the focal nodes within a larger heterogeneous network. The clinical population is an object that is employed as a means to enable coordination by stabilizing the relationship among multiple actors and across heterogeneous networks. This object takes form as a result of multiple practices of purification, most importantly through measurement. Closer examination of medical research practices reveals that these regimes of classification serve to simultaneously construct and blur the boundaries of medical knowledge as well as the boundaries of what is normal and what is pathological."
0,"Although occupational segregation by sex has declined in recent decades with the rising numbers of women entering traditionally male occupations (e.g., law and medicine), the achievement of women within male-dominated occupations continues to lag behind that of their male colleagues. In this article, we draw on theories of proportional rarity, expectations states, and social support as three dimensions that provide a structural understanding of tokenism. We examine tokenism in the legal profession through: (1) organizational context in tern is of gender composition and gender ratios at upper echelons of the organizational hierarchy; (2) status characteristics of the minority and dominant groups; and (3) the content of communications (emotional and informational support) that women receive from their colleagues. These communications may act to integrate, or conversely, through their absence, exclude women and heighten boundaries to women's career advancement within the traditionally male profession of law. We used questionnaire data collected from a sample of 740 married lawyers working in law firms to examine these aspects of tokenism. The results reveal that women's rising representation in law firms leads to enhanced communication through informational and emotional support, benefiting both men and women lawyers. Yet, a more gender balanced organizational context, in terms of gender composition, does little to shift the expectation states associated with women lawyers and the professional disadvantage women face when they have family responsibilities."
0,"This paper explores the differences among the four groups of bishops at who participated at the Second Vatican Council, with the goal of answering a simple, but key, sociological question about the Council: who wanted what, and why?  In brief, I argue that in order to understand, explain and ideally even predict, the perspectives, interests and goals, or what I call organizational strategies, of religious leaders, sociologists of religion must broaden their understandings of the factors that affect them.  Though supply-side theory recognizes that the presence of other religious institutions (i.e. religious pluralism) has powerful effects on religious leaders, I argue that in order to predict not only whether religious leaders will be open to reform, but also what reforms they will prioritize, we must consider not only the presence of other institutions in a society, but the relationship between those organizations, especially whether those relationships are stable."
0,"In the past decade, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of adolescent extracurricular participation in development.  Not only do adolescents have a significant amount of leisure time at their disposal, but there is considerable evidence to indicate that how adolescents spend their free time has important implications for both short-term and long-term development.  Drawing on ecological systems and social control theories, our paper focuses on the implications of high school participation in extracurricular activities on long term educational attainment and family related outcomes using nationally representative longitudinal data from the NELS: 88.  Although several other studies have also focused on the impact of participation in extracurricular activities, particularly on educational attainment and work and career related outcomes, or even on risky behavior, we also elaborate on the impact on family and child birth related outcomes, a topic relatively untouched in the literature.  Furthermore, we emphasize on long term effects, at least eight years beyond high school.  Preliminary results show that involvement in high school extracurricular activities leads to positive long term outcomes in individual lives.  There is a generally positive impact on long term educational attainment measures, either in the form of enrollment beyond high school or even up to the Bachelors degree level, even after controlling for family, school and student school achievement characteristics.  In contrast, such participation at the high school level discourages negative family outcomes such as the incidence of early births or the incidence of single parent families in the long term."
0,"Between 1960 and 2000 Congress passed nine bills aimed at altering some aspect of the pharmaceutical industry.  Analysis of their effects has focused on whether their merits outweighed the economic fears that additional regulations decrease the rate of innovation(Grabowski 1976; Grabowski and Vernon 1986; DiMasi, Hansen et al. 2003).  The object of this paper is to expand this inquiry beyond merely the rate of new introductions and to ask whether policy change altered either the quality or the type of medicines being produced(Comanor 1986).  This is in the tradition of past work on population-level changes and their effects on firm-level variables(Dobbin and Dowd 1997; Carroll and Swaminathan 2000; Perrow 2002).  The intent here is to examine whether different policy regimes resulted in the production of different kinds of new drugs.  To answer this question I rely on time series analysis on data collected on all approved new drugs between 1960-2000.  I find that while economic success begot greater innovation and policies intended to assist innovation succeeded in doing so, policies that produced additional regulations and policies intended to increase competition, contrary to past work on innovation rates, did not reduce the quality of new drugs.  This suggests that the access or innovation binary that dominates pharmaceutical policy discussions may be based on a false dichotomy."
0,"The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze the historical development of the Dominican Republic from 1492 to 1891, using the economy as the foundation of political dynamics.  The study uses a historical materialist theory and methodology to explore the economic and political development of the Dominican Republic from 1492 to 1891.  A historical materialist theoretical framework examines the changes in the productive system of society, its mode of production, which includes both the forces of production and the relations of production, and analyzes the role of the political superstructure  the state and political struggles  within the economic context.  Using a descriptive historical methodology the research draws economic and political data from existing historical studies on the Dominican Republic.  The study, beginning with a brief description of the pre-colonial conditions, before 1492, is divided into two eras: Colonialism, 1492 to 1821, and Neo-Colonialism, 1822 to 1891.  Each era is subsequently divided into periods.  Within each period the mode of production and political superstructure are analyzed and the data are presented in tables for each of the periods.  The findings of this research suggest that as the mode of production developed, corresponding shifts in the political superstructure occurred.  Over the entire period of study, 1492 to 1891, the Dominican Republic went from a ranking society  based in primitive agriculture, hunting and gathering techniques and relatively equal ownership, control and distribution of the forces of production  to early stages of global capitalist development based in primitive accumulation and large-scale production of agricultural commodities for sale in the growing world market.  The political superstructure also changed from a ranking society of Taino people to political struggles among the Spanish, French, Haitians, Mulattos and Mestizos for control of the Dominican state.  The Dominican Republic gained its political independence in 1844 and by 1891 the United States emerged as the primary neo-colonial power."
0,"Having delinquent friends is one of the strongest known correlates of delinquent behavior, yet sociologists have been curiously silent as to why some adolescents acquire delinquent friends and others do not.  Analysis of data from the national Survey of Parents and Children reveals a strong association between forms of direct and indirect parental supervision and the kinds of friends that adolescents acquire.  Parents who monitor their childrens affiliations exhibit a variety of traits typical of involved or conscientious parents.  Indirect parental supervision appears to mediate the effect of attachment to parents - one of the few established correlates of delinquent friendships - and both neighborhood and school conditions strongly influence the likelihood of having delinquent friends.  These and other findings underscore the crucial role that parent-child relations play in the process of acquiring delinquent friends."
0,"Child obesity is a public health priority with numerous and complex causes. This study focuses on factors within the family, namely stressful experiences, which may be associated with child obesity. We examine data from the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for children in two age groups: 5-11 and 12-17 years old. Results from an ordered probit regression model of child weight categorizations (healthy weight, overweight, obese) indicate positive associations between a range of family stressors (lack of cognitive stimulation and emotional support in the household among younger children, and mental and physical health problems and financial strain in the household among older children) and child overweight and obesity. We discuss how public policies that reduce family stressors may, in turn, help reduce child obesity. "
0,"In the last decade, the number of asylum claims based on sexual orientation persecution has grown across the globe.  Increasingly, individuals who fear violence or harassment based on their sexual orientation have sought refuge in countries with established asylum systems. Most of these established national asylum systems evolved from an international commitment to the protection of refugees as defined by the 1951 Convention Relating the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.  While the refugee standards set forth by these international documents do not specifically reference sexual orientation, many countries have interpreted these standards to include persecution based on sexual orientation.  Yet even though the asylum systems are derived from common international documents and have converged on a number of issues including sexual orientation persecution, the process of asylum remains at the level of the nation-state. In this paper, I examine asylum cases based on sexual orientation persecution in order to look at the ways in which the international definition of asylum has been incorporated into the asylum systems of three countries when dealing with sexual orientation asylum cases.  The ultimate goal is comparative: I examine and compare the asylum systems of the three countries  Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom- through an analysis of asylum cases based on sexual orientation in each country"
0,"Our research uses two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to analyze the stability of same- and cross-race friendships. We find the following: First, interracial friendships are less stable than same-race friendships, even after controlling for a variety of contextual and dyadic characteristics, such as school racial composition and friends' similarities in attitudes and behaviors. Second, measures of dyadic similarity (aside from race) are weak predictors of friendship stability. Third, measures of reciprocity and closeness are strong predictors of friendship stability and appear to dampen the effects of racial difference. These results indicate that race is of continuing significance in structuring the social lives of American adolescents. They call into question the assumption that the factors that drive friendship formation also drive friendship stability. And, they suggest that more attention should be paid to the quality of interracial friendships, as measured by degree of reciprocity and closeness."
0,"The intended purpose of this project is to examine the social construction of race for Black students attending predominantly Black and Predominantly White colleges.  Previous research has examined the experiences of Black students at the college level, but few have attempted to understand the meaning of Blackness within these settings.  In this project, in-depth interviews were conducted with twenty African American students attending two major universities located in the state of Texas.  In this study, several emerging similarities and difference were discovered and discussed concerning what being Black means to students in these contexts.  The data takes us through the process of understanding the experiences of these students in the university setting, through the ways in which these experiences are internalized, and finally how race is ultimately constructed.  Finally, we are provided an opportunity to   examine the similarities and differences in environmental factors contributing to how race is socially constructed."
0,"Is the trend towards rising earnings inequality associated with increased exploitation? The authors investigate exploitation among workers using data for manufacturing industries. Defined as the underpayment of earnings relative to productivity as evaluated in the market, exploitation is measured for various groups of employees. The results indicate significant levels of exploitation among women, Hispanics, African Americans, and blue-collar workers. By contrast, employees who are overpaid relative to their productivities include middle-aged workers, older workers, and managers. Additional findings suggest that the increase in inequality in recent years has been associated with heightened exploitation due to the underpayment of workers in the lowest two quintiles of the earnings distribution, while workers in the upper two quintiles have become increasingly overpaid. Rising earnings inequality in the manufacturing sector thus appears to be associated with increased exploitation when the latter is measured as the underpayment of market value to workers. A related analysis by Liu, Sakamoto, and Su also investigates patterns of economic underpayment and overpayment but does not link them explicitly to inequality in the distribution of earnings and how the level of inequality has been increasing in recent years."
0,"Interactions within institutional setting regularly involve participants with asymmetrical claims to internationally relevant knowledge. These claims are legitimated through the institution of social hierarchies that determine the privileges of members to certain situated knowledges. Contrary to many perspectives that presume these hierarchies to exist a priori to the interactional context, this study demonstrates the achievement of hierarchies within the interactions on the popular television series Antiques Roadshow. I first show that appraisers use strategically designed questions to situate their knowledge of objects and the general market beyond that of lay audiences. Secondly it is shown how participants engage in modified perspective display series within the interaction whereby the owners ideas of the objects are brought into alignment with the knowledge appraisers. This occurs through a negotiation of the knowledge relevant to assessing an adequate valuation of the object. These interactional processes work to reify the roles of appraiser/expert and owner/lay-person. Findings from this study point to further research opportunities concerning the development of markets from everyday interaction."
0,"Using data from 49 in-depth interviews conducted in three Midwestern cities, I investigate religious identity and identification as a traditional, moderate, and liberal Catholic.  Following the lead of other scholars, I examine whether Catholics religious identities are products of religious movements. After highlighting an array of traditional and liberal Catholic movement organizations, I examine whether (or how) Catholics are connected to these organizations. I find that most ordinary Catholics are not familiar with these traditional and liberal movement organizations or periodicals. So, while religious movements may be important in institutionalizing identities and garnering media attention for religious disagreements, the origins of religious identity for the majority of individual Catholics must be found in their daily interpretations and interactions."
0,"This research adopts a structural identity theory framework to examine post-recruitment activism in the Irish Republican Movement. The data are from members of Provisional Sinn Fein who were first interviewed in the mid-1980s and subsequently reinterviewed in the mid-1990s and the late 2000s. Ten and 20 years after their initial interviews, some respondents were still involved in Provisional Sinn Fein while others had: helped create a rival organization, Republican Sinn Fein, in 1986; helped create another rival organization, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, in 1997; withdrawn from activism; and withdrawn from and then reentered activism. The interviews show that the decision to exit from activism was primarily motivated by changes in the respondents' personal lives and not for political reasons. For some respondents, life changes brought with them new relationships and new identities that limited their availability for activism and also forced respondents to choose between competing identities. The decision to remain an activist but to create a rival organization was influenced by interaction among subgroups of activists in Provisional Sinn Fein and by the respondents' perception of what is important for Irish Republicanism."
0,"The pro-anorexia and bulimia movement has arisen in concert with the growing rate of eating disorders in young men and women.  Adherents believe that anorexia (sometimes personified as Ana or Anamadim) and bulimia (Mia) are ways of life, rather than a disease to overcome.  The relative youth of members also signals a comfort with technology, which, in turn, allows for their use of personal websites as a means of communication and thinspiration for other pro-ana persons.  This paper examines the current pro-ana websites for commonalities of theme and symbolism, then relates it to current theories of religion and psychological disease. The socio-religious aspects of certain elements of the pro-ana lifestyle (such as the Ana Creed, and Ten Ana Commandments, and the Summoning of Anamadim) and the images of flight, angels, and thinspiration are particularly highlighted."
0,"Therapeutic religion may create and reinforce many excesses, including excess freedom.  This is a case study of a therapeutic religious community that serves GLBT African Americans, many of whom have traumatized histories.  The congregation at the center of this study permits and encourages self-expressions, typical of therapeutic societies, but these freedoms have contributed to a sexually charged church environment, where sexual displays and sexual behaviors are highly visible, and graphic sexual language is common in sermons.  But this is not to say that this congregation disregards conventional norms altogether, or that therapy is used simply as an excuse for behavioral excesses.  Rather, this study suggests that, in spite of the occasional messiness that may arise, therapeutic societies that serve marginalized and traumatized populations necessarily need to expand their functions.  For religious organizations, this requires that the congregation integrate diverse functions (i.e., the therapeutic functions) into its religious repertoire.  This is particularly the case if the immediate goal of the congregation is to eliminate human suffering, in which case a distinctly therapeutic and highly experimental form of religion may be pivotal in helping to reintegrate the wounded back into the community folds."
0,"Increasing constraints placed on race-based school diversification have shifted attention to socioeconomic desegregation. Although past research suggests that socioeconomic desegregation can produce heightened achievement, the ""frog pond"" perspective points to potential problems with socioeconomic desegregation in nonachievement domains. Such problems are important in their own right, and they may also chip away at the magnitude of potential achievement benefits. In this article, I report conducted propensity score analyses and robustness calculations on a sample of public high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As the proportion of the student body with middle- or high-income parents increased, low-income students progressed less far in math and science. Moreover, as the proportion of the student body with middle- or high-income or college-educated parents increased, low-income students experienced more psychosocial problems. Such patterns were often more pronounced among African American and Latina students. These findings suggest curricular and social psychological mechanisms of oft-noted frog pond effects in schools and extend the frog pond framework beyond achievement itself to demographic statuses (e.g., race/ethniciry and SES) perceptually linked to achievement. In terms of policy, these findings indicate that socioeconomic desegregation plans should also attend to equity in course enrollments and the social integration of students more generally."
0,"This study documents and explains historical variation in U. S. criminal deportations. Results from time-series analyses suggest that criminal deportations increase during times of rising unemployment, and this effect is partly mediated by an elevated discourse about immigration and labor. An especially strong association between deportations and unemployment emerges from 1941 through 1986, a period in which the federal law enforcement bureaucracy and deportation laws were well established and judges retained substantial discretion. After 1986, changes in criminal deportation rates mirror the trend in incarceration rates. The study connects the burgeoning sociological literatures on immigration and punishment, revealing a historically contingent effect of labor markets on the criminal deportation of non-citizen offenders."
0,"While social movement scholars have added immeasurably to our knowledge of activist framing, few researchers analyze the circumstances leading to variation in the frames articulated by movement actors. In this study, 1 explore an important and understudied form of frame variation, whether activists use more moderate or more radical frames. Using framing data from the early twentieth-century U.S. women's jury movements, I first show that activists offered both a more traditional and moderate difference frame, arguing that women should be permitted on juries because they would provide a unique female perspective in jury deliberations, and a more radical equality frame, stating that women had an equal right to sit on juries and they were as intellectually capable as men to do so. Second, I demonstrate that a combination of circumstances explains whether the jury activists were likely to articulate more moderate or more radical arguments. I find that frame variation is driven by activist organizational identities, a cultural and political resonance process, and a counterframing process. Findings from multinomial and binary logistic regression analyses reveal that all three processes influenced jury activist framing."
0,"Sentiment has been shown to affect status processes, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown. This paper presents an experiment with evidence in support of one of two alternative approaches -- sentiments as constituent elements of expectations or sentiments as mediators of expectations -- to conceptualizing the effect of positive sentiments on the status organizing process, as studied within the framework of Expectations States Theory (Fisek and Berger 1998).  Subjects levels of responsibility for team outcome and sentiment vary between experimental conditions, in accordance with the Camilleri and Berger Model for Decision-Making (1967).  Experimental outcomes include subjects proportion of stay responses and post-experiment questionnaire items pertaining to affect."
0,"Barack Obama has developed the reputation of a very compelling and effective orator; his speech-making abilities have been cited as a key component of his successful campaign for President of the United States. But what exactly makes him such a compelling speaker? This paper uses methods of conversation analysis to explore the way Obamas complex combination of rhetorical devices in sequence and both vocal and non-vocal aspects of delivery systematically achieve positive, coordinated audience response. This single-case analysis of a segment of speech-making illuminates the mechanisms by which successful audience response is achieved, and provides empirical evidence for what creates a potently successful political speech."
0,"New Zealand has experienced a marked increase in immigration since the early 1990s, which has fostered greater ethnic diversity. However, little is known about the changing patterns of spatial differentiation among ethnic groups. Using the New Zealand Census data from 1991 to 2006, we examine the patterns of Asian, Maori, and Pacific people residential segregation from the majority European population. We then assess the effects of ethnic group and geographic level characteristics on the levels of segregation. The results reveal that Pacific people are the most segregated group from Europeans. The levels of segregation have declined only slightly for Maori and Pacific people over time. but increased gradually for Asians. While results show general support for spatial assimilation theory, different sets of factors were found to be associated with levels of segregation for each ethnic minority group. "
0,"The game of poker has dramatically increased in popularity in America over the past decade, and includes a new trend in poker in which tournaments are played with no monetary wagering. These free poker tournaments are the primary focus of this project. Our interest in these free poker tournaments was twofold: first, we wished to identify what would motivate a person to play poker when there is no profit motive; second, we wanted to learn how the social dynamics of the game itself may or may not change when monetary risk is not present. Through covert participant observation of free poker tournaments at four different locations we were able to discover three main motivations among the players: sharpening skills for later cash games, sociability, and gaining the status of a regular player. We also discovered that the tenor and tempo of the game tended to vary not as a function of the location, but rather because of the social class of the players. We offer several hypotheses to guide future research endeavors in this area."
0,"The purpose of this research was to investigate whether sociologists in particular and institutions in general are perceived to make life easier for people who are different in terms of sexual orientation, race/ethnic identity, or religious affiliations by being more accepting and supportive. A sample of 74 heads of sociology departments was surveyed. T-tests were used to determine the level of support among departments and institutions. Results indicate that sociology department chairs in public colleges, those in nonreligious programs, and those in larger institutions were generally more supportive of minorities than those in private, religious, and/or smaller institutions."
0,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts significant influence on firm outcomes and strategies through the regulatory approval process. Prior research suggests that the agencys desire to protect its bureaucratic reputation from audiences such as consumers, the media, and politicians determine the duration of a drug review. I argue that the FDAs historical evolution as an arbiter of science has infused the agency with values that focus the agencys attention on specific types of signals. In particular, I contend that firm status in the knowledge domain becomes salient as the FDA attempts to resolve the uncertainty in determining drug quality. Furthermore, I propose that innovation strategies and external shocks generating uncertainty enact the FDAs scientific identity to a greater degree, rendering a firms status in the knowledge domain even more valuable. Using the review times for 1,303 New Drug Applications (NDAs) approved by the FDA between 1990 and 2004, I find that firms with higher knowledge status receive faster approval of their drugs, with roughly a one month advantage for a top 13% firm over an average firm. The benefits of being a high status actor were further enhanced when firms attempted to do radical innovation, but status had limited effects when the regulator suffered from a legitimacy crisis. The paper concludes with a discussion of the contributions to organizational theory and the practical implications for innovative strategies of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms."
0,"Cultural theory posits that social groups possess a cultural repertoire or tool kit that reflects beliefs, ritual practices, stories, and symbols that provide meaning and impetus for resource mobilization.  The theory has recently been used in an ethnographic study to explore the relationship between Black Church culture and community action among Black residents. However, little empirical research has been forwarded relative to the relationship between longstanding Black Church cultural components  specifically, scripture, song, prayers, and sermons  and activism among Black churches. Most research has been theoretical, anecdotal, or based on qualitative findings. Using a large national sample of Black congregations across seven denominations, I test aspects of cultural theory. Findings support the consistent, direct relationship between prayer groups and gospel music and various forms of community action and less influence by spirituals and the general usage of sacred scripture."
0,"Prior work on equal employment opportunity tends to focus on a limited set of factors that influence change in organizational structures and policies. This article considers a broader set of potentially influential legal and political coercive pressures-namely, discrimination lawsuits, federal court dynamics, and state political ideology-and analyzes their implications for concrete changes in organizational behavior Using national establishment-level data on the supermarket industry from 1983 to 1998, 1 estimate African American managerial representation using a series of auto-distributed lag (ADL) models with fixed-effects. The results show that in the year following a lawsuit filing against a particular supermarket establishment, African Americans are more likely to enter management. Furthermore, over the long run, coercive isomorphism (whereby establishments subject to a lawsuit come to adopt industry averages for African American managerial representation) seems to prevail. Finally, legal pressures associated with federal court judges 'gender and racial/ethnic diversity and state-level government ideology are also influential. I conclude by discussing these results and the importance of systematically incorporating political process into sociological theorizing and analyses of workplace diversity"
0,"Living in diaspora, Jewish Americans construct their ethno-religious identity out of the myths of imagined homelands, connections to ancient ancestors, and through the lens of the Holocaust. The concept of home, both in terms of homeland and in terms of the physical homes that people live in, provides the framing notion. In this paper, I explore how American Jews use objects in their homes to evoke ancient Israel and bypass the contemporary political issues in the Middle East, to mediate the memory of European persecution which culminated in Holocaust horrors, and to support a specifically American Jewish identity. Personal and group histories combine in the home, often in the form of objects, and these objects help to create a sensory, emotional space.  The data for this paper comes from in-depth interviews, four to seven hours long, that were accompanied by house tours in twelve American Ashkenazi Jewish homes in the city of Chicago. Interviewees were American-born adult women and men whose religious observance ranged from modern Orthodox to completely secular. The interviews took place in homes across the city of Chicago and surrounding suburbs."
0,"This study assesses the effects of Hurricane Katrina by applying the environmental racism-classism and residential segregation literatures. Disasters offer a new perspective for these literatures in that they provide insight into how individuals are concentrated into areas with pre-existing risk. Nearly all environmental racism-classism and residential segregation research investigates how environmental problems occur in areas already inhabited by vulnerable populations. This study concludes that elevation and the concentration of minorities are significantly associated with hurricane damage, whereas other variables highlighted by the literature are not."
0,"We assess the intergenerational educational mobility of recent cohorts of high school graduates to consider whether Hispanics' lagging post-secondary attainment reflects a temporary lull due to immigration of low education parents or a more enduring pattern of unequal transmission of social status relative to whites. Using data from three national longitudinal studies, a recent longitudinal study of Texas high school seniors and a sample of students attending elite institutions, we track post-secondary enrollment and degree attainment patterns at institutions of-differing selectivity. We find that group differences in parental education and nativity only partly explain the Hispanic-white gap in college enrollment, and not evenly over time. Both foreign- and native-born college-educated Hispanic parents are handicapped in their abilities to transmit their educational advantages to their children compared with white parents. We conclude that both changing population composition and unequal ability to confer status advantages to offspring are responsible for the growing Hispanic-white degree attainment gap."
0,"Modern sociological identity analysis argues that people perform a preferred identity, rather than revealing an essential self. But what if a given situation necessitates performance of apparently incompatible identities? Earlier research seems to suggest that people will resist one identity and foreground another. Here, the authors present another strategy of delicately balancing the performance of conflicting identities. Their interviews of Swedish young men who were victims of violence reveal that this identity balance occurs through emphasizing and defending the threatened but seemingly preferred identity, with reference to the other identity in more subtle terms. As they elaborated on their experiences, these men did not reject a victim identity altogether but subtly or implicitly modified it. They discursively positioned themselves as both ""masculine men"" and ""victims,"" combining seemingly mismatched identities. They achieve the identity work by describing initiative and defense, accounting for non-resistance, and describing injuries, fear, and sympathy from others."
0,"Social movements' capacity to mount effective challenges often hinges on the availability of scare resources. Yet despite considerable scholarly interest in the ways that resources are mobilized, we know surprisingly little about the conclusion of this process, how movement actors strategically disburse resources to achieve specific goals. Recent attempts to revitalize the American labor movement, particularly efforts to reverse fifty years of membership decline, provide a substantive backdrop for examining resources and success. Data from a sample of local unions and their organizing activities from 1990 through 2001 indicate that tactical resource disbursements do increase the union's ability to recruit new members, but their effect is contingent upon other dimensions of organizing, such as firm and state hostility. The findings extend our understanding of movement agency and offer insight into the growth of social movement unionism today. Keywords: social movements, resource mobilization, labor unions, union organizing, resistance to unions."
0,"Perceptions of control over one's life represent a vital topic in social research: they capture the interaction between the individual and society and reflect the structures and adversities in people's lives. This study uses longitudinal data to examine how victimization, an event with established consequences for social functioning, interacts with fear of crime and perceived risk to influence sense of personal control (SPC). It posits a vulnerability model, wherein victimization affects SPC directly and amplifies the effects of fear and perceived risk. Linear regression models predicting baseline SPC, and longitudinal change in SPC, reveal mixed results. Victimization intensifies fear's effects at baseline, but actually increases SPC and desensitizes against perceived risk; subsample analyses suggest resilience as one explanation. Fear and perceived risk both attack SPC, with perceived risk having particularly consistent effects. Findings suggest that resilience may operate alongside cumulative adversity and that related social experiences can have divergent impacts."
0,"Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and three decennial US censuses are used to examine the influence of metropolitan-area characteristics on black and white households' propensity to move into poor versus nonpoor neighborhoods. We find that a nontrivial portion of the variance in the odds of moving to a poor rather to a nonpoor neighborhood exists between metropolitan areas. Net of established individual-level predictors of inter-neighborhood migration, black and white households are more likely to move to a poor or extremely poor tract rather than to a nonpoor tract in metropolitan areas containing many poor neighborhoods and a paucity of recently-built housing in nonpoor areas. Blacks are especially likely to move to a poor tract in metropolitan areas characterized by high levels of racial residential segregation and in which poor tracts have a sizeable concentration of blacks. White households are more likely to move to a poor than to a nonpoor tract in metropolitan areas that have comparatively few African Americans. "
0,"Using the Interpersonal Exchange Model of Sexual Satisfaction, we consider how infidelity, pornography consumption, marital satisfaction, sexual frequency, premarital sex, and cohabitation are associated with married couples' sexual satisfaction. Data from 433 couples are analyzed with structural equation models to determine the contributions of (a) each respondent's predictors (actor effects) and (b) his/her spouse's predictors (partner effects). No gender differences in actor and partner effects emerge. Marital satisfaction and sexual frequency act as rewards and increase sexual satisfaction. A partner effect emerges for marital infidelity, suggesting that a spouse's infidelity is costly for sexual satisfaction. Finally, some evidence suggests that pornography consumption is costly for own and spouse's sexual satisfaction, especially when pornography is used by only one spouse. "
0,"The issue of racism is at the forefront of the debate over the legitimacy of the anti-immigrant movement.  Contemporary racism survives on strategies put in place post-WWII and post-Civil Rights that make it more covert.  Moreover, Latinos, who are the primary target of the anti-immigrant movement, are often overlooked as racialized subjects.  This effectively disguises racism and often leaves explanations for what makes the anti-immigrant movement racist at bay.  Based on a literature review and interviews with the anti-immigrant movement (1999-2008), this paper reveals how the anti-immigrant movement is embedded on a global scale, how racism is embedded in the anti-immigrant movement, and highlights how this racism has manifested in the post-9/11/01 world."
0,"Migration and stratification are increasingly intertwined. One day soon it will be impossible to understand one without the other. Both focus on life chances. Stratification is about differential life chances - who gets what and why - and migration is about improving life chances - getting more of the good things of life. To examine the interconnections of migration and stratification, we address a mix of old and new questions, carrying out analyses newly enabled by a unique new data set on recent legal immigrants to the United States (the New Immigrant Survey). We look at immigrant processing and lost documents, depression due to the visa process, presentation of self, the race-ethnic composition of an immigrant cohort (made possible by the data for the first time since 1961), black immigration from Africa and the Americas, skin color diversity among couples formed by US citizen sponsors and immigrant spouses, and English fluency among children age 8-12 and their immigrant parents. We find, inter alia, that children of previously illegal parents are especially more likely to be fluent in English, that native-born US citizen women tend to marry darker, that immigrant applicants who go through the visa process while already in the United States are more likely to have their documents lost and to suffer visa depression, and that immigration, by introducing accomplished black immigrants from Africa (notably via the visa lottery), threatens to overturn racial and skin color associations with skill. Our analyses show the mutual embeddedness of migration and stratification in the unfolding of the immigrants' and their children's life chances and the impacts on the stratification structure of the United States.

0,"Scholarly inquiry into collective memory has fostered a host of innovative questions, perspectives, and interpretations about how individuals and communities are both constituted by the past and mobilize it for present-day projects. Race is one of the more important current issues demonstrating how the presence of the past is both potent and sorrowful in the United States. It is therefore critical to examine how memories of racial oppression, conflict, and reconstruction shape race relations. Studies of race relations, however generally ignore collective memory role in shaping racial norms and attitudes. This article uses the 1993 General Social Survey to address the silences in the collective memory and race relations literatures by examining how Americans' recollections of the civil rights movement influence their racial attitudes and racial policy preferences. Although we find that Americans' opinions about government programs targeting African Americans are unrelated to civil rights memory, respondents who spontaneously recalled the civil rights struggle and its victories as an especially important historical event generally expressed more racially liberal opinions than did those with different memories. Our findings both support the basic presupposition of collective memory studies-memory matters-and point to a fruitful innovation in the study of racial attitudes."
0,"Within the United States, there are more people behind bars then ever before in history. The county jail is a fundamental part of this prison industrial complex, and this institution serves many more outsiders than inmates: millions work and visit jails each year. This combination of institutional purpose and interpersonal interaction is most effervescent in the waiting room of the space, a place that brings the public and the incarcerated as close to one another as possible. This study explores the waiting room of a jail: the physical barrier between the public, the incarcerated, and those tasked with their supervision. Utilizing participant observation conducted within the waiting room of a county jail in the Western United States, issues of institutional authority, interpersonal communication, and impression management are illuminated as they emerge from the space just in front of the steel bars. A consistent level of miscommunication and confusion between visitors and staff was observed, while the interpersonal communication between the jail staff, visitors and social agents remained polite. In addition, the intense stigma management occurring within the jail waiting room caused staff and inmates alike to use of humor as a simple method of alleviating some of this tension."
0,"The article takes a position against recent theories of globalization and mobility by arguing that there are important trends toward increased immobility. Whereas goods travel relatively freely in a global market, the same cannot be said for people. Various forms of immobility are explored through the key notion of enclaves. While ghettoes and wall building have been traditional aspects of the enclosure of people, the article argues that new biological technologies offer enhanced methods of tracking and containing people. The principal cause behind these developments is a greater emphasis on securitization by the state and hence globalization theories are criticized insofar as they propose that state borders have become more porous."
0,"This study examines whether long work hours exacerbate gender inequality. As working long hours becomes increasingly common, a normative conception of gender that prioritizes men's careers over women's careers in dual-earner households may pressure women to quit their jobs. I apply multilevel models to longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to show that having a husband who works long hours significantly increases a woman's likelihood of quitting, whereas having a wife who works long hours does not appear to increase a man's likelihood of quitting. This gendered pattern is more prominent among workers in professional and managerial occupations, where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting are strong. Furthermore, the effect is stronger among workers who have children. Findings suggest that overwork can reintroduce the separate spheres arrangement, consisting of breadwinning men and homemaking women, to many formerly dual-earner households."
0,"Research on how individuals leave sex work examines this transition by focusing on either structural/economic conditions that keep them in the trade or internal changes that prompt exiting. Leaving certain roles, such as those deemed criminal and deviant, may be more challenging due to labeling, stigma, and a lack of resources. In this study, the author analyzes the particular factors that lead women to exit street prostitution via enrollment in ""helping"" organizations. The author finds extant theories do not fully capture how multiple factors combine to pull women off the streets. Rather, the author contends it is both internal and external factors that lead women to initially exit prostitution. This study draws on interviews with thirty-six street prostitutes from four different U. S. cities to address these concerns."
0,"The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of increased parent time demands on depression in children and adolescents. With escalating time pressure in American families with children, and the documented effects of this increase on marriages and adult well being, we anticipated a concomitant impact on child mental health.  The findings largely supported the carry-over hypothesis that increasing parent time demands negatively affected the psychological well being of children.  Children in families with increased time demands were at greater risk for both depressive symptoms and depression diagnosis.  There was evidence that this effect was mediated by parental psychological well-being and the quality of activities together. Additionally, time demands were associated with a deviation from developmental trajectories of depression, such that increased time demands were associated with increased depression."
0,"More than four decades ago, the Kerner Report chronicled the violent disturbances of the 1960s and predicted that the United States was rapidly moving toward two racially separate and unequal societies. Resulting concerns about black and white inequality form a critical chapter in the history of sociological research. Few studies, however, explore trends in racial inequality in rates of violence. Has the gap between black and white violence rates significantly narrowed since 1960 and, if so, why? Drawing on recent work on assimilation and the literature on race inequality, we develop a set of hypotheses about black-white differences in violence rates and how these rates may have changed during the past four decades. We emphasize race differences in family structure, economic and educational inequality, residential integration, illicit drug involvement, and population composition. Using race-specific homicide arrest and census data on social, economic, and demographic conditions for 80 large U. S. cities from 1960 to 2000, we find substantial convergence in black-white homicide arrest rates over time, although this convergence stalled from the 1980s to the 1990s. Consistent with theoretical expectations, we find that, since the 1960s, the racial gap in homicide arrests declined more substantially in cities that had greater reductions in the ratio of black to white single-parent families, as well as in cities that experienced greater population growth and increases in the proportion of the population that is black. Also, as expected, the race gap in homicide arrests widened in cities that had an increasing ratio of black to white rates of drug arrests. Measures of racial integration, however, have no discernible impact on the black to white homicide arrest ratio."

0,"This study examines how the overlap between informal and formal networks in the workplace is related to the degree of attachment for individuals in work organizations. Two types of informal networks, identified by their content and structure, are commonly found in work organizations: friendship networks and trust networks. Both the content of networks and the coupling (or overlap) of individual member networks with formal authority networks are important for two kinds of attachment, organizational identification and organizational internalization. Data from a survey of employees in five, small, start-up organizations were collected during 1997 and early 1998. Tight coupling between friendship networks and formal authority networks is found to have a strong positive relationship to organizational identification. Tight coupling between trust and formal authority networks is also found to be strongly and positively related to both organizational identification and internalization. Additionally, tight coupling between trust networks and formal authority networks is more influential in predicting identification than coupling between friendship networks and formal authority networks."
0,"Work-family conflicts are common and consequential for employees, their families, and work organizations. Can workplaces be changed to reduce work-family conflict? Previous research has not been able to assess whether workplace policies or initiatives succeed in reducing work-family conflict or increasing work-family fit. Using longitudinal data collected from 608 employees of a white-collar organization before and after a workplace initiative was implemented, we investigate whether the initiative affects work-family conflict and fit, whether schedule control mediates these effects, and whether work demands, including long hours, moderate the initiative's effects on work-family outcomes. Analyses clearly demonstrate that the workplace initiative positively affects the work-family interface, primarily by increasing employees' schedule control. This study points to the importance of schedule control for our understanding of job quality and for management policies and practices."
0,"Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood (GID-C), a psychiatric diagnostic category described as a strong and persistent cross-gender identification accompanied by persistent discomfort about ones assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex (APA 1994: 532-533), has been criticized both by mental health professionals and by nonprofessional commentators since its inclusion in the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1980. The most often levied critique is that GID-C pathologizes pre-homosexual children. Further, critics of GID-C draw on the APAs own decision to declassify homosexuality (1973) to bolster their assessment of GID-C. In this paper, I examine the often-ignored early psychiatric and psychological literatures on gender variant children to show that professionals were interested in a variety of possible adult outcomes (notably, homosexuality, transvestism, and transsexuality). I then review both the intraprofessional and extraprofessional critiques of GID-C, and discuss some of the ways that they are limited in their ability to effect diagnostic revision. Finally, I propose suggestions about how to better conceptualize the problems with GID-C."
0,"The United States military has a “zero tolerance” policy toward sexual harassment and sexual violence.  Despite the existence of these policies, the military continues to produce high rates of both sexual harassment and sexual violence.  We argue that this paradox exists because the military is a masculinized institution that has been organized to promote specific ideals of masculinity. We also argue that although the entire U.S. Military participates in the construction of a masculine identity, it is not monolithic; there are variations across military contexts, producing significant differences in rates of sexual violence.  This paper will explore the varying rates of sexual violence against women in the military, explaining the different rates of violence through an analysis of the shifting significance of the military’s combat masculine warrior ideal across varying contextual and individual factors."
0,"For decades sociologists, criminologists, political scientists and socio-legal scholars alike have focused on the symbolic and instrumental dimensions of law in examinations of the effects Of social reform and policy implementation. Following in this tradition, we focus on the relationship between hate crime policy and hate crime reporting to identify the conditions under which a symbolic law is accompanied by instrumental effects at the initial phase of the law enforcement process - the official recording of a hate crime event. Using data on California police and sheriff's agencies we estimate hierarchical Poisson models to determine how agency-level enforcement efforts, chiefly the creation of a formal policy on hate crime, affect official hate crime reporting. We also examine how community and agency attributes influence the effects of policy on the reporting of hate crime. We find that agency characteristics, in this case measures of the integration of the local agency within the community, shape the degree to which agency policies affect the official reporting of hate crime. Our findings reveal that while symbolic law is not intrinsically incapable of producing changes in enforcement patterns, such effects are contingent upon agency and community processes. Thus, we conclude by conceptualizing the varied enforcement contexts within which a body of symbolic law is rendered instrumental."
0,"The 2008 Democratic presidential primary provides a unique opportunity to examine how community structure is related to intra-party electoral outcomes. Because the contest between Barak Obama and Hilary Clinton remained competitive until the very end, we are able to analyze voting outcomes for more than 2,300 U.S. counties where votes were cast before the ultimate winner had been determined. The primary was also noteworthy because Obama was seeking to become the nation's first African American President, while Clinton hoped to be the first woman president. The competition, and the response that the candidates received from voters as they campaigned across the country, revealed interesting dynamics pertaining to race, class, and gender. We argue that Obama and Clinton appealed to constituencies on different sides of a cultural divide among Democratic voters, and that divide is rooted in occupational segregation. Our results show that occupational segregation by race, and especially by sex, are related to the voting outcomes, with Obama gaining his strongest support in the most integrated contexts and his weakest support in segregated contexts."
0,"This article examines the issue of state compliance with universal human rights norms, focusing on a social constructivist model suggested by Thomas Risse, Stephen Ropp, and Kathryn Sikkink (1999). This spiral model outlines five stages of socialization in which different forces work together to bring a change in the policies of repressive governments. I argue that the model suffers from three major theoretical shortcomings. It (1) is over-deterministic and idealistic in its proposition that once progress toward human rights compliance has started there is no turning back; (2) treats a country's human rights practices as a homogenous block and does not leave room for disaggregation of different practices; and (3) fails to sufficiently account for the role of serious conflicts and security threats in shaping state's repressive policies. Nevertheless, drawing largely on the Israeli case I show that the spiral model should not be discarded. When substantially modified and complemented with other sociological and international relations approaches, the model remains useful for understanding the processes of change in specific violations."

I draw as a shadow comparison the research findings of other scholars on Jewish experiences in camps and ghettos."
0,"Most accounts of neighborhood racial transition have told the story of blockbusting, with a greater focus on white residents than on arriving African American residents. This study challenges existing accounts of blockbusting by using the sociospatial perspective to examine racial transition in terms of the experience of African Americans, and in the context of the suburbs. Focusing on the Black experience rather than the white one, and on changes to suburban space rather than urban space produces a very different assessment of blockbusting. Overall the outcome of blockbusting is positive in three respects: (1) It achieves the primary goals of African American residents. (2) Many of the negative actions associated with urban blockbusting appear to be less pronounced in the suburban case for reasons having to do with the historical and spatial particularities of suburbs, or turn out not to be related to blockbusting per se. (3) The rapidity of whites flight from the community is slowed because of characteristics of the suburbs and community organizing tools employed there."
0,"The Hispanic population is now the largest and fastest growing minority in the United States, so it is not surprising that ethnic threat linked to Hispanics has been associated with harsher crime control. While minority threat research has found that individuals who associate blacks with crime are more likely to support harsh criminal policies, the possibility that this relationship exists for those who typify Hispanics as criminal has yet to be examined. Using a national random sample, this study is the first to use HLM to find that perceptions of Hispanics as criminals do increase support for punitive crime control measures, controlling for various individual and state influences. Moderated and contextual analyses indicate this relationship is most applicable for individuals who are less apt to typify criminals as black, less prejudiced, less fearful of victimization, politically liberal or moderate, not parents, and living in states with relatively fewer Latin American immigrants.

0,"This study explores how a group of women recently released from prison as parolees attempt to sustain their exit from deviant careers by constructing replacement selves. To examine this process, I analyze semi-structured interviews with female ex-offenders and show how they draw on work as a hook for change (Giordano et al. 2002) in their unfolding identity work. Contrary to traditional gendered scripts, these women view themselves as active participants in the world of work. Upon release not only do they desire to work to meet financial needs, but they also use employment as an avenue through which they begin to construct pro-social replacement selves. Drawing on longitudinal qualitative data, I point out that as time on the outside passed, many of the women continued to use work as a way to fashion new conventional selves despite their experiences with low-quality working conditions. I also provide evidence, however, that when women experience significant employment instability, they are unable to sustain their hopeful identity project and, instead, reengage their past deviant selves."
0,"Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However, a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify their identities. An individual's moral identity-wherever it falls on the moral-immoral continuum-guides behavior, and people experience negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue. Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations that have cultural expectations-that is, framing rules and feeling rules-regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally. We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt and shame."
0,"While the intersection of religion, morality, and work captured the attention of several of sociology’s classical theorists, contemporary scholars tend to neglect the potential role of religion and morality in the workplace.  In this paper, I document the complex ways that religious orthodoxy and moral absolutism shape the work behaviors, values, and decision-making of American workers.  Analyzing data from the Economic Values Survey, this paper contributes to the sociologies of religion, morality, and work in several ways.  First, contrary to those who argue that religion serves a more therapeutic than directive role in the workplace, I show that religion shapes both workplace behaviors and work values.  Specifically, the religiously orthodox exhibit stricter compliance with workplace rules than others and tend to value the extrinsic dimensions of work.  Second, unlike most research on religion and morality, I distinguish between religious orthodoxy and moral absolutism.  I show that while these concepts are conceptually related—in that religious orthodoxy is one specific type of moral absolutism—their implications for the workplace are quite distinct.  Unlike religious orthodoxy, moral absolutism is associated with valuing the intrinsic dimensions of work and thinking about the well-being of others when making tough workplace decisions."
0,"This paper hypothesizes and tests for differences in the levels and predictors of sexual harassment of young working women in the United States and Japan. We examine the effects of age and life course transitions and the distribution of sexual harassment experiences across industries, occupations, and individual characteristics. Analyses of the General Social Survey (1994 and 1996) and the Japanese Survey on Working Womens Consciousness (1992) suggest that age cohorts entering the labor force following the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Japanese Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1985 report more sexual harassment than other age groups. Working in the manufacturing industry also increases the likelihood of sexual harassment experience in both countries. We pool the data sets and test for national differences with cross-product interaction terms, finding that the effects of age, income, and job satisfaction all differ significantly between Japan and the United States. We interpret these results based on the extant literature on sexual harassment, legal consciousness over the life course, and comparative research on workplace behaviors."
0,"This study shows that hedge fund managers (“managers”) engage in social behaviors affecting their investment performance. An emerging “new financial sociology” has shown that the social interactions of finance professionals are critical to the functioning of financial markets. This study provides a quantitative dimension to this emerging literature, using hierarchical linear models to demonstrate that “clannishness”, “gossip” and “paradoxical imitation” each impact hedge fund investment returns. Elite managers belong highly-cohesive mentorship-based lineages (i.e. “clans). As a few individuals belong to multiple lineages, these clans are loosely linked. This study finds finds that highly-central managers within this elite gain a small but significant investment advantage, perhaps because they know what the various clans are doing. “Gossip” is also important as managers trade information with their former co-workers. This study finds that managers who have high closeness centrality within these “gossip” networks manage risks better. “Imitation” paradoxically harms the imitators. Many hedge fund managers copy elite managers’ investment patterns. A large academic literature suggests that imitation is rational and beneficial. However, this study finds that imitators harm themselves, possibly because they follow trends instead of leading them. By investing into a bubble, they risk exiting these investments too late. Most interestingly, this study finds that hedge fund managers behave differently during economic crises than they do under normal conditions. Facing high uncertainty, they fall back upon their social networks, and engage in greater imitation. This insight opens a wedge for the sociological study of financial crises--and the manias and panics involved."
0,"In order to further develop an understanding of the Southern subculture of violence and its association with female-perpetrated homicide, new techniques must be developed that sufficiently operationalize Southern cultural influence. For this study, we created the Southern Subculture Index, a factor combining a county's population born in the South, Evangelical Christian, and of Scots-Irish ancestry. Specifically, we hypothesize that by using this index, the relationship between female-perpetrated homicide and Southern culture will be visible. Results from a negative binomial regression model confirm the veracity of a positive and significant effect of the Southern Subculture Index on female-perpetrated homicide."
0,"We use Wisconsin Longitudinal Study data (n = 2,678) to assess the effects of religious denomination and ideology on end-of-life treatment preferences in two hypothetical terminal illness scenarios: physical pain and severe cognitive impairment. We found no statistically significant differences when comparing traditionally defined religious denominational groups (i.e., conservative, moderate and liberal Protestants; Catholics; other religions; no religion). However, when we considered the intersection of broad denominational group and adherence to Christian fundamentalist beliefs, we found that fundamentalist Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants were significantly more likely than their nonfundamentalist counterparts to desire life-extending treatments in both scenarios. These effects were fully explained by beliefs about quality of life and religious control over medical decisions. We end with a discussion of the study's theoretical and policy implications."
0,"Why and how do some homeless people manage to overcome homelessness while others dont?  While we do know a lot about why and how people become homeless, we know surprisingly little about exit from homelessness. Building on comparative research on the impact of social policy on homeless peoples exit chances in Germany and the United States, I demonstrate that homeless peoples exit chances are largely determined by homeless peoples distinct life course experiences. In using ethnographic research methods, I was able to delineate distinct life course types which imply substantial differences in the extent to which people are prepared to exit and the ways in which they utilize strategies toward facilitating lasting exit from homelessness as well as the outcome of such efforts.  An understanding of the life course specific differences in the utilization of exit strategies and the likelihood of success has important implications for welfare state intervention and thus the ability of administrators, case workers, and social workers to provide adequate assistance in helping homeless people to overcome homelessness for good."
0,"Sociologists long have observed that the urban poor rely on kinship networks to survive economic destitution. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among evicted tenants in high-poverty neighborhoods, this article presents a new explanation for urban survival, one that emphasizes the importance of disposable ties formed between strangers. To meet their most pressing needs, evicted families often relied more on new acquaintances than on kin. Disposable ties facilitated the flow of various resources, but often bonds were brittle and fleeting. The strategy of forming, using, and burning disposable ties allowed families caught in desperate situations to make it from one day to the next, but it also bred instability and fostered misgivings among peers."
0,"This paper investigates the intergenerational inheritance of life-chances by asking how education-mediated opportunities are allocated across generations. Inheritance involves here transferring of cultural capital (family background), educational opportunities and employment opportunities left from previous generations. The framework is anchored in the baby-boom generation, the expansion of university education, and the allegedly normal transition from home via educational system to labor market. Martin Trows classification of elite, mass and universal higher education is also utilized. In the European context we analyze the education-mediated life-chances of three subsequent generations (baby-boomers born in 1945-1950; their offspring born in the 1960s and 1970s and the coming grandchildren) by asking 1) how will parents education be reproduced by their offspring and 2) how does the employment of subsequent generations correspond to the expectations of appropriate employment? Focusing on the baby-boomers offspring generation we demonstrate by simulations how changes in educational opportunities (1st redistribution of life-chances) produce changes in educational outcome (2nd redistribution of life-chances). There is a kind of intergenerational deception in the air. Graduates dreams of high occupational status corresponding to educational level inherited from the era of the elite university can hardly be fulfilled in an era of mass or universal higher education."
0,"An ongoing debate amongst social scientists is whether class matters for African Americans in determining their residential proximity to whites.  Some argue that class does not matter, that African Americans of all classes are highly segregated.  On the other hand, other research suggests that blacks of higher socioeconomic status do have more contact with whites. What previous research is unclear on is whether these patterns have changed over time.  This paper examines how blacks ability to translate individual characteristics into proximity to whites changed over the 1970-2000 period.  The results presented here suggest that between 1970 and 1990 it became more difficult for blacks to translate their individual endowments into proximity to whites.  After 1990, however, it became easier for blacks to blacks to translate their individual endowments into proximity to whites."
0,"This article asks whether the relationship between neighborhood and household income levels and neighborhood hazard levels varies according to neighborhood and household racial composition. Using a national, census tract-level data set, the authors find that black, white, and Hispanic households with similar incomes live in neighborhoods of dissimilar environmental quality, that the association between neighborhood and household income levels and neighborhood hazard levels varies according to neighborhood and household racial composition, and that increases in neighborhood and household income levels are more strongly associated with declining hazard levels in black neighborhoods and households than in white neighborhoods and households. These findings contradict Wilson's claim that the significance of race has declined in the modern industrial period and demonstrate that environmental racial inequality is not the product of racial income inequality. In addition, these findings suggest that the impact of higher incomes on black/white proximity to environmental hazards has less to do with increases in white geographic mobility ( relative to black geographic mobility) than with the ability of higher income blacks to escape the highly polluted, disorganized, and deteriorated neighborhoods to which so many low-income blacks are confined."
0,"The widespread adoption of computer-mediated communication (CMC) has facilitated the increase of team-based collaboration.  The previous studies of organization theory indicated that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) would have a positive relationship with individuals collaboration intension and the group performance.  Holding a different framework, scholars like Cohen (1995), Walsh and Roselle (1999) and Russell (2001) suggested the use of CMC facilitates information and knowledge exchanges, increases scientific collaboration, and thus might enhance academic productivity.  However, both perspectives show a limited discussion on how OCB or email use would alter the collaboration network and consequently increase collaborative productivity. This paper addresses the productivity debates by examining relationships among OCB, the use of email, collaboration structures, and academic productivity.  This study examines scientific productivity via email in the collaboration group of scientific community across four disciplines (sociology, physics, environmental engineering and agriculture).  A survey of 304 scholars in Taiwan was conducted during a four months period.  The findings suggested scholars who shared more knowledge-oriented information by email were more likely to join a collaborative team.  Once the collaboration is established and connected, simple message shared by email is enough to maintain the co-authored relationships.  Those who collaborate more with others enjoy higher productivity of co-authored and internaitonal publication.  The OCB does show a positive relation with collaboration, however, it doesnt have a significantly direct relationship to scholars co-authored publication and international collaboration."
0,"Existing explanations of tokenism predict similar experiences for all numerically small, low-status groups. These explanations, however, cannot account for variation in the experiences of different low-status minority groups within the same setting. This article develops a theory of tokenism that explains such variation. Drawing on 117 interviews in the leveraged buyout industry (LBO) and a comparison of the differing experiences of female and African American male tokens in that setting, I argue that tokenism is contingent on the local cultural context in which it is embedded. Specifically, I identify two elements of an occupation's culture-its hierarchy of cultural resources and its image of the ideal worker-that can specify some status characteristics as more relevant to and incompatible with the occupation's work than others. In LBO, the industry values cultural resources that, on average, women lack but men possess, and the ideal worker is defined such that it directly conflicts with cultural beliefs about motherhood. Consequently, in this context, gender is a more relevant status characteristic for exclusion than is race, and female tokens are differentially disadvantaged. In addition to revising received wisdom about tokenism, this study integrates and advances social psychological and cultural theories of exclusion by deepening our understanding of the role of cultural resources and schemas in occupational inequality."
0,"Identity commitment (Kerpelman and Mosher 2004), role expectations (Kerpelman and Schvaneveldt 1999), and self-concept (Adamson, Ferrer-Wreder and Kerpelman 2007) are linked to an individuals future outlook.  In addition, mastery and future orientation are important factors in ones mental well-being.  However, identity salience is missing from the mastery and future outlook literature, particularly absent is the future orientation of adults.  Using a sample of adults from southern California, this study examines the relationship between identity salience and future outlook while investigating the influence mastery has in this relationship.  This study aims to address this gap in the literature and expand the identity research program by examining family and work roles in the context of future orientation.  Using two regression models, we found that family identity salience and mastery are both statistically significant predictors of future family outlook (p<.01), and work identity salience (p<.05) and mastery (p<.01) are also both statistically significant predictors of future occupational outlook.  Thus, a high level of family identity salience and mastery predicts having more hope for change in family life, being able to do more in ones family life, have greater choices in ones family life and have a general positive life outlook in 5 years.  In addition, the greater level of work identity salience and mastery a person has, the greater hope for change in the work realm, the ability to do more in ones work, and having more choices one has in five years."
0,"Taking women born 1971 in East and West Germany as a comparison case, this paper investigates how institutions shape family formation processes and the onset of first birth. To examine family formation as a holistic process we use longitudinal data and recent methodological innovations in sequence analysis (Lesnard 2006, 2008). We hypothesize that distinct institutional configurations in terms of family, gender and housing policies in East and West Germany let certain partnership states, such as cohabitation and marriage functioning as ‘sequence constraints’, i.e. preconditions for fertility. In line with our hypotheses, our findings indicate a stronger polarization of West German women into two groups: motherhood proceeded by a double sequence constraint of first cohabitation then marriage before giving birth on one hand, and childless women in non-committed relationships on the other hand. While each of these patterns is prevalent among East German women as well, we found a distinctly East German pattern of motherhood in cohabiting relationships, which is non-existent among West German women. This supports a stronger sequence constraint of marriage on motherhood among West German women. Our findings indicate that these distinct East and West German patterns of family formation are at least partly driven by more traditional marriage attitudes and a more gendered household division of labor among West German women."
0,"This paper examines the outcomes of individual abuse claims filed against states under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as decided by the Human Rights Committee (HRC). Results from selection models that account for a country's initial decision to join the Optional Protocol and an individual's subsequent decision to file a complaint under it show that the substantive nature of complaints were more determinative of HRC outcomes than were country-level characteristics. Claims relating to due process rights, civil liberties, and political freedoms most often resulted in violations, whereas claims pertaining to discrimination, suffrage rights, and the rights of women and children were much less successful. Only two country-level characteristics robustly affected HRC outcomes, net of rights claims: democratizing countries were found in violation at higher rates than were other countries, while violation rates declined as a function of aggregate wealth.

0,"In this paper, we address two critical gaps in prior research regarding the association of childrens mental health problems with educational attainment: the lack of attention to the temporal form of the association and the failure to consider diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, we identify latent classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems from ages 6-8 through ages 16-18. Youth in the classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school completion and college entry. Youth who experienced internalizing or externalizing problems in childhood or adolescence were less likely than youth with stably low levels of problems to complete high school; youth who experienced externalizing problems at either age were less likely to enter college but college entry was only significantly associated with internalizing problems that began in childhood. We evaluated the ability of three sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude, disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational expectations were important mediators even in the presence of controls for academic aptitude and disruptive behaviors. We conclude that social responses to youths mental health problems contribute to their disrupted educational trajectories."
0,"Like the pirate and the slaver before him, contemporary humanitarian law judges the war criminal as hostis humani generis, an enemy of all mankind subject to universal punishment.  However, current accounts of the grounds of that judgment are unclear as to whether the criminal responsibility of perpetrators derives from their breach of law or moral values.  Using the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan together with an analysis of contemporary humanitarian law, I argue that Lacans model of war crimes permits the development of a more persuasive conception of humanitarian crimes.  Drawing on this model, I argue that it is necessary to shift from a focus upon the person of the war criminal to the criminality of their actions.  This shift involves understanding the perpetrators actions in terms of a breach of the social relation owed to an other.  Following Lacans analysis of crimes as symbolic acts, I argue that the war crime is an act which refuses to recognize social ties to others.  This conception of war crimes in turn leads to a new model of humanitarian law which conceives justice as the re-institution of a socio-symbolic relation to another."
0,"In the 1990s, many immigrants bypassed established gateways like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Miami to create new immigrant destinations across the US. In this paper, we examine how segregation and spatial assimilation might differ between established gateways and new destinations among the 150 largest metropolitan areas. Using data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, we calculate levels of dissimilarity for Hispanics and Asians by nativity for these two gateway types. Our findings show that segregation levels are consistently lower in new destinations. However, Hispanics in new destinations experienced significant increases segregation during the 1990s, suggesting a convergence in residential patterns by destination type. Nevertheless, in both destinations the native-born are less segregated than the foreign born-consistent with immigrant spatial incorporation. Finally, socioeconomic indicators are generally consistent with predictions of spatial assimilation. "
0,"Most studies that attempt to understand immigrant political incorporation focus on patterns of electoral participation and citizenship acquisition. Given that nearly 60 percent of the foreign-born population in the United States is comprised of noncitizens, we argue that past studies miss an important dimension of the immigrant political incorporation process. In this article, we move beyond the ballot by documenting patterns of immigrant protest and conducting an analysis of the conditions under which immigrant organizing occurs in traditional gateways and new destinations. In addition to political opportunities and resources, we argue that conditions heightening group boundaries between immigrants and natives-what we call boundary markers-should play an important role in encouraging immigrants to develop a shared minority status and make collective claims on behalf of the larger group. Using hurdle models, we test our theoretical ideas with a new data set comprised of over 200 immigrant protest events in 52 metropolitan areas across the United States. Our results challenge past studies of immigrant mobilization because we find that inclusionary contexts characterized by greater access to formal political and economic incorporation both hinder and facilitate immigrant organizing, while boundary markers-measured here as threats and segregation-tend to encourage immigrant protest. Keywords: immigrant political incorporation, protest, collective action, new destinations."
0,"Male and female undergraduates (N = 240) participated in opposite-sex dyads and worked on a computerized visual task presented as ""masculine."" Participants in the eight experimental conditions received either higher or lower scores than their partner; this phase was omitted in the two control conditions. In turn, half of the experimental groups received universal competence-standards from the experimenter, while the other half set standards by themselves. In the second phase, the two persons worked on the task as a team. The central hypothesis is that subject-generated standards will favor the men, and that this will result in the women being perceived as having less competence even if achieving the same performance-level as men: this inequality is predicted to no longer be maintained in the groups with experimenter-set standards. Measures include rejection of influence, perceived ability in self and partner, and level of acceptance of both the stated sex-linkage of the task and the experimenter-set standard. Results and their interpretation are presented and discussed in detail. "
0,"Entrepreneurship research has increasingly been attentive to new business formation and economic activity in diverse environments, including but not limited to entrepreneurship in urban environments.   We argue that while this attention has been productive, confusion about the meaning of “urban” in the phrase urban entrepreneurship could well lead to conflicting predictions.  Specifically, we argue that the conceptualization of an urban area as a ""diverse metropolis"" leads to different predictions about entrepreneurial activity than the conceptualization of an urban area as an ""iconic ghetto"".  We develop and test hypotheses based on this distinction on a sample of business foundings in 2009 across 217 Census Block Groups in the City of Newark, New Jersey.  We find that the two conceptualizations of urbanity do in fact produce conflicting results, and that in particular, the benefits of diversity associated with the ""diverse metropolis"" conceptualization of urbanity are reinforced in neighborhoods conceptualized as ""iconic ghettos""."
0,"Although some point to the large effects of schooling on civic engagement (usually measured in terms of volunteering and participation in civic organizations) and social cohesion (usually measured in terms of social networks and relationship quality), the effects of schooling on social outcomes have not been estimated with the same rigor as the effects of schooling on labor-market outcomes, such as earnings. In particular, previous research has failed to consider (i) the many potential and often unobserved confounding factors (""endowments"") influencing both schooling and social outcomes, including family upbringing, innate characteristics, and personality, and (ii) the ways in which schooling pushes individuals in multiple directions simultaneously, including toward greater social engagement, but also toward more independent and market-driven pursuits. Using samples of unrelated persons, ordinary siblings, and identical twins, this study explores the effects of schooling on measures of civic engagement and social relationships, as well as labor-force earnings and labor-force participation. The siblings models reveal a more complex picture than typically suggested by standard individual estimates. On one hand, the results reveal a robust positive effect of schooling on earnings: well-schooled persons work more and earn more, albeit not as much as associations without control for endowments suggest. On the other hand, the results reveal more tenuous and occasionally negative effects of schooling on social outcomes. The effects of schooling on volunteering and membership in civic organizations, for example, disappear almost entirely with control for endowments. Also, within-identical-twins models reverse the positive effects of schooling on reports of support from friends, family, and coworkers. These results may reflect the tension schooling creates between market and non-market commitments, as well as between independence and interpersonal reliability. Schooling may, indeed, induce some pro-social behaviors, but schooling allows individuals choices of whether to pursue more personal interests as well. "
0,"In this paper we examine the protest activities of the online group Chanology against the Church of Scientology beginning last January.  Of particular interest to scholars is the intersections between social movements, online culture, and technological innovation in bridging the two.  We are particularly interested in the ability of Chanology to successfully and rapidly move their protest activity from a distributed online-only forum to actual physical protest at over a hundred sites.  Additionally we focus on the way this type of protest is divergent from most contemporary social movement theories for mobilization."
0,"This article examines the links between the petroleum and tourism industries by analyzing how an oil disaster, whether actual or perceived, may attract nature-based tourism interests. To better understand the role of communities, local governments and/or the media in establishing links between the petroleum and tourism industries, this article explores how the construction of an oil pipeline in Ecuador and an oil spill in the Philippines created opportunities for tourism. Each case contributes to our understanding of how an oil disaster supports nature-based tourism and how both industries supply a resource or an experience to nonlocal consumers, while converging to alter local communities, economies, and ecosystems. Indeed, tourism investments following a disaster may become a sideshow to the disaster that shifts attention from the disaster to participation in new economic opportunities. In addition, tourism may represent ecological alterations, which are more subtle, yet as damaging, as an oil disaster. The proposed model is then applied to two additional cases, the Exxon Valdez oil spill and Hurricane Katrina, to test its use in understanding other postdisaster developments."

The themes of adjustment in this paper are the following: Social integration, gender and shame, veterans’ networks, and social withdraw."
0,"Although educators are not in agreement about how best to facilitate civic engagement across diverse curricula, considerable attention in the past decade has focused on multiple aspects of service and service learning. Unlike internships that are similarly experiential, service and service learning emphasizes both course learning objectives and addressing community needs that are otherwise unmet.  Typically, service as civic engagement makes claims to “give back” to underserved communities and enhance student learning with applied work.  Initial research suggest there are conflicting intentions and aspirations at work through service learning in higher education and its implementation calls into question: (1)  who or what is served; (2) if it enhances student learning and retention; and (3) faculty assessment in the eyes of the university evaluation system.  Although in the preliminary stages, our research on service and service learning at colleges and universities is investigating these questions and multiple sociological correlations among race, gender, social class, institutional status, and student learning/retention.  This session invites educators to share their perspectives on service learning and outcomes of their applications of service in courses - offering examples of best practices and obstacles to effective teaching and learning."
0,"For Durkheim, the sacred was that which was separate from the everyday experiences of the mundane world.  Neo-Durkheimian scholarship has drawn on this insight to understand the narratives and codes that make up the civil sphere.  In this version of events, sacred meanings are ritualized in a civil religion that drives the practices of citizens.  Here I return to some of Durkheim’s positions to argue that a better understanding would be one that posited a less than complete separation between the sacred and mundane.  Drawing on Foucault and contemporary anthropology, I argue that everyday encounters with the sacred are constitutive of the sacred itself.  In the mundane or everyday realms of our lives we are exposed to and come to accept or reject discourses and practices regarding the sacred. Everyday sites are not just spaces of (self-) management, but also spaces integral for the creation and reproduction of sacred codes.  I explore this dynamic in the context of citizenship.   I argue that the sacred of a society, including citizenship, is not solely something learned through top-down forms of power.  Rather, societies reproduce their sacred values by intertwining them into the daily lives of individuals."
0,"Women's workforce participation increased strongly over the 1980s and 1990s, especially among middle aged wives. Multivariate analysis of IsssA data (N = 9412) reveals large compositional changes and a trend for succeeding cohorts of women to work more than their predecessors, but few if any period effects. Among the compositional changes, rising women's education and falling fertility substantially elevate women's workforce participation and hours worked. No clear time effects were associated with particular policy initiatives. Importantly, interaction tests suggest that the effects of education and of family situation have not changed over time. Finally, family of origin and religiosity have both direct and indirect effects. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

0,"This study takes a life-course approach to examine whether family, and religious characteristics influence individual-level delinquency, trajectories from early adolescence through young adulthood. Based oil data from the NLSY79, results suggest that residing with two parents deters youths from becoming delinquent and that supportive parenting practices reduce their likelihood of becoming involved in delinquent behavior early in adolescence. There is also evidence that family, and religion interact to predict delinquency trajectories. Religion enhances the effect of parental affection in deterring delinquent behavior and mitigates the increased risk of high levels of delinquent behavior among youths in single-parent families. Moreover the findings indicate that delinquency trajectories are not immutable; family transitions are associated with increases in delinquency, bill religious participation throughout adolescence and marriage are associated with declines in delinquent behavior Overall, results suggest that family and religious characteristics continually influence the event to which youths commit delinquent acts."
0,"How and why does religious socialization contribute to the reproduction of social inequality? An in-depth case study of religious youth programming provides an empirical investigation of the way that a primary institution that many youth encounter may serve to legitimate the broader field of social stratification. Despite the apparent lack of direct interest of religious congregations in maintaining a system of religious youth group from which some participating youth can benefit more than others, a neo-institutional analysis reveals systematic tendencies toward reproducing stratification. Mimetic isomorphism to schools is one explanation for the socially stratified patterns in religious youth programming."

We add a qualitative component to our collaborative Proximity to Risk Survey Project (n=620) to investigate how residents living near the Ascon Landfill site trust their neighbors, and local, state, and federal officials and agencies to take care of environmental situations, close to home. Much of the literature on environmental hazards has been centered on the less affluent and more politically disadvantaged populations because they are the most likely to be proximate to industrial and commercial environmental hazards. While this focus on inequity is important, what is less known is how more affluent individuals perceive and react to these threats when the threat is located in their community."
0,"We use an expanded definition of family work and test its association with marital well-being. Using a gender perspective, we examine the role of the respondent's and partner's performance of family work for both husbands and wives. Data are taken from a sample of couples with dependent children under age 18 (N=96), and separate regression equations are estimated by gender. Though housework is cited as one of the most contentious issues reported by couples, it is not significant in our analysis of marital well-being. In our analysis, other forms of family work are considered, and childcare, emotion work, and formal volunteering are significantly associated with marital well-being. The role of partner's provision of emotion work is particularly salient. Discussion of the gendered nature of our findings follows."
0,"Scientists have produced a modest literature documenting the associations between individual religious behaviors and educational outcomes. Most scholars hypothesize that religion provides a context of social capital in which students reap educational benefit (or detriment) from the adults in the religious community. Despite the intergenerational influence inherent in the various social capital explanations, few studies have directly examined the role of parental religiosity in the educational outcomes of adolescents. In this study, I begin to address this gap by investigating whether and how parental religiosity is associated with a student's chances of graduating from high school. I seek to answer three questions related to parental religiosity and students' high school graduation. First, does parental religiosity affect a student's chances of graduating from high school? Second, if parental religiosity is associated with high school graduation, does it operate primarily through the student's own religiosity or is there an independent effect? Third, if parental religiosity is independently associated with a student's high school graduation, what are the mechanisms by which it is associated? Using data from the first and third waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I find that students whose parents attend religious services more often have greater odds of completing high school, and students who attend religious services with parents are almost 40% more likely to finish high school, net of a number of other religious and sociodemographic factors."
0,"Despite a plethora of studies, we do not know why autism incidence has increased rapidly over the past two decades. Using California data, this study shows that children living very close to a child previously diagnosed with autism are more likely to be diagnosed with autism. An underlying social influence mechanism involving information diffusion drives this result, contributing to 16% of the increase in prevalence over 2000-2005. We eliminate competing explanations (i.e., residential sorting, environmental toxicants, and viral transmission) through seven tests and show that information diffusion simultaneously contributed to the increased prevalence, spatial clustering, and decreasing age of diagnosis."
0,"The potential for improving response rates by changing from one mode of data collection to another mode and the consequences for measurement and nonresponse errors are examined. Data collection from 8999 households was done in two phases. Phase I data collection was conducted by telephone interview, mail, interactive voice response, or the Internet, while Phase 2 focused on nonrespondents to Phase 1, and was conducted by a different mode, either telephone or mail. Results from our study suggest that switching to a second mode is an effective means of improving response. We also find that for the satisfaction-dissatisfaction questions asked in this survey, respondents to the aural modes (telephone and IVR) are significantly more likely than are respondents to the visual modes (mail and web) to give extreme positive responses, a difference that cannot be accounted for by a tendency towards recency effects with telephone. In general, switching to a second mode of data collection was not an effective means of reducing nonresponse error based on demographics. "
0,"This paper focuses on the development of the concept of megaphone leadership as a new analytical term used to describe leaders who, from a position of popularity through being salient entertainers, are able to turn their fan base into grassroots activist support. This is demonstrated through the compelling case of  the Grillini. This movement's quick ascendancy into Italy's political arena has much to owe to its leader, Italian comedian Beppe Grillo, especially his blog's success through its use as tool of communication, aggregation and mobilization. The first part of this paper explains the concept of megaphone leadership by placing it within the literature on social movement leadership. In the section that follows, the main characteristics and achievements of the Grillini are outlined. In the last part, the case of the Grillini is used to show the causes for the emergence of this leadership model, the extent of its success, and its main advantages and disadvantages. The final objective is to show how the unique communicative and organizational opportunities provided by celebrity leadership, as exemplified by this case, can have a deep impact on social movement leadership and its capacity for aggregation, organization and communication."
0,"How does collaboration between academic research and industry shape science? This article argues that companies' relative indifference to theory nudges their academic partners toward novel, theoretically unanticipated experiments. The article then evaluates this proposition using fieldwork, archival materials, and panel models of all academic research using the popular plant model Arabidopsis thaliana and the companies that support that research. Findings suggest that industry partnerships draw high-status academics away from confirming theories and toward speculation. For the network of scientific ideas surrounding Arabidopsis, industry sponsorship weaves discoveries around the periphery into looser, more expansive knowledge. Government funding plays a complementary role, sponsoring focused scientific activity in dense hubs that facilitate scientific community and understanding."
0,"This study advances a conceptual framework for understanding the transformation of places into recovery machines after major hurricanes. This framework contends that in the years following such disasters, pro-growth coalitions take advantage Of new sources of material and symbolic capital to promote further demographic growth. It also contends that the spatial nature of this growth varies significantly as a result of social inequalities among residential subpopulations, contributing to uneven transformation of local neighborhoods across affected regions. To test hypotheses derived from this framework, we combine innovative Geographic Information Systems data from ""billion dollar"" storms of the early 1990s with demographic data from local census tracts. Results support the recovery machine framework and imply that post-disaster resilience may contribute to the creation of larger, more segregated versions of affected regions that await exposure with the next major disaster."
0,"The literature on emerging credit card markets suggests that without requisite institutions such as credit bureaus, credit rating agencies, laws, etc., credit card issuing decisions are likely to be based upon trust  trust in ones network of friends and/or the networks of trusted others  rather than rational calculation (credit scoring). This does not seem to be the case in China (or other Asian countries for that matter), and the existing literature does not provide compelling explanations for how banks are incorporating calculative methods in their practice of issuing cards. The goals of this paper are therefore twofold: The first is to describe the current state of the credit card market in China, including the types of cards available, scope of usage, institutional support, as well as the social, economic and political environment influencing the credit card market in attempt to understand how credit-issuing decisions are made. The second goal of the paper is to outline a framework for understanding the actual practices of credit card decision making."
0,"Why do beliefs that attach different amounts of status to different categories of people become consensually held by the members of a society? We show that two microlevel mechanisms, in combination, imply a system-level tendency toward consensual status beliefs about a nominal characteristic. (1) Status belief diffusion: a person who has no status belief about a characteristic can acquire a status belief about that characteristic from interacting with one or more people who have that status belief. (2) Status belief loss: a person who has a status belief about a characteristic can lose that belief from interacting with one or more people who have the opposite status belief. These mechanisms imply that opposite status beliefs will tend to be lost at equal rates and will tend to be acquired at rates proportional to their prevalence. Therefore, if a status belief ever becomes more prevalent than its opposite, it will increase in prevalence until every person holds it."
0,"Studies imply that family and school resources independently affect delinquency. Yet research has not developed a conceptual or analytic framework for exploring how these variables may interact to affect delinquent behavior. The authors propose that certain family and school variables may serve as substitute or complementary forms of capital in equations designed to predict delinquency. In particular, school capital may substitute for low family capital to decrease involvement in delinquent behavior. Using data from the 1990 National Educational Longitudinal Study and the 1994 - 1995 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ( Add Health), the authors find that high-quality school environments serve as substitutes for poor parental attachment and a lack of parental involvement in children's schooling, especially among adolescents who experience low academic achievement or report a lack of academic values. Hence, school-based social capital attenuates involvement in delinquency partly by compensating for high-risk family environments."
0,"The experience of work and retirement in later life has become increasingly varied over the past forty years. However, little is known about how public- and private- retirement provisions impact the transactions between labor force statues in the emergent retirement landscape. This problem is analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling and data from the Health and Retirement Study. Results suggest that both public- and private- benefits generally increase transitions to retirement and decrease transitions to unemployment or to increased work. However, because private benefits are not equally distributed throughout the population, the results is a two tiered system of retirement provisions: a disadvantaged group that relies solely on public provisions, and an advantaged group that supplements their public benefits with private pensions and employer provided insurance."
0,"It is well known that women are more religious than men. Miller and Stark (2002) explained this gender gap in religiosity as a consequence of mens greater biological propensity to take risks, or their risk preference. Accordingly, they viewed a lack of religious participation as an other-worldly risk. In this paper, we analyze some of the assumptions of risk-preference theory and measure belief in an afterlife to better operationalize other-worldly risk. Using General Social Survey data, we find that risk preference theory cannot adequately explain the gender gap in religiosity because the gender gap is actually larger for those who do not believe in an afterlife than for those who do. We conclude by proposing alternative explanations for findings that contradict Miller and Starks theory, with greater attention to sociological understandings of gender."
0,"Revolutionary advances in telecommunications technology have created a ovirtual world.o There are a variety of new social phenomena associated with this novel milieu. This represents an excellent opportunity for the discipline of sociology to revisit its descriptive roots. This is especially true for the sociology of deviant behavior because new forms of deviance are clearly related to technological innovations (e.g., Internet crimes against children, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying). The current undertaking examines the deviance disavowal strategies of men arrested in Internet sex stings. The data consisted of the videotaped police interrogations of 18 subjects, about half of whom were arrested in televised stings. The results indicate these men engaged in three disavowal strategies seeking to maintain a normal definition of self and manage the stigma of their arrest. Directions for future studies in the sociology of deviance are suggested."
0,"Based on data collected during ethnographic fieldwork, this paper examines barriers to condom use in the context of transactional sex among 48 female commercial sex workers (CSWs) in Mainland China. The data suggest that differences in socio-economic profiles and the organization of work among different groups of CSWs create different obstacles to condom use. Compared with other CSWs, freelance street-walkers have the lowest level of consistent condom use with their clients. They also have the most disadvantaged socio-economic profiles and isolated working conditions. Among them, the major barriers to the use of condoms with clients include the low health concern of their clients, economic pressure and the threat of violence. On the other hand, the major obstacles to consistent condom use among CSWs working in entertainment venues are drunkenness of clients, the pricing mechanism, and familiarity with clients. Based on our findings, we argue that condom use should be conceptualized as a process of negotiation occurring under particular social and institutional space (e.g. the criminalization and social stigmatization of sex work). It is shaped by multiple factors, including the social background of CSWs and their clients, the organization of commercial sex work, and the social relations of CSWs."
0,"The literature on retail entrepreneurship makes an important distinction between shopkeeping and petty trading. Building on this literature, the present study addresses two questions about retail enterprise in U.S. cities in the late nineteenth century: To what extent were retail entrepreneurs from the Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) European groups shopkeepers rather than petty traders? And which region of the country offered the best opportunities for retail entrepreneurs from these groups to become shopkeepers? Census data from 1900 show that: (1) retail entrepreneurs from these immigrant groups were more likely to be petty traders than shopkeepers; and (2) the opportunities for these entrepreneurs to become shopkeepers were greatest in the South, an emerging peripheral region with relatively small immigrant communities. These findings cast doubt on the conventional view that conditions in major northern cities bolstered shopkeeping among entrepreneurial groups, such as Russian and Polish Jews, in the late nineteenth century."
0,"Same-sex partners' familial expectations, including the division of household labor are not well-understood in the existing research-research that largely references the experiences of white, middle- and upper-income lesbians who develop relationships with egalitarian goals. This article uses qualitative and survey research methods to evaluate the common view that two elements of feminist egalitarian ideology-economic independence and the equal distribution of housework and childrearing-are the defining features of lesbian-headed households. Analyses of 32 black women in lesbian step families suggest that partners share the providing role but biological mothers undertake significantly more household chores. More chore responsibility is used as a trade-off for greater authority over other aspects of household organization, including family finances and childrearing. The biological mother control in a family is largely a function of her legal tie to a child and greater perceived responsibility for the child well-being. Notably, this pattern persists even when she earns less than her mate. Without the gender structure of male privilege or the material advantage of high income, these families associate control over household labor with greater relationship power. These findings, while derived from analyses of a unique population, hold implications for broader conceptions of gender and power with families, the bases of interactional power and the internal manifestations of power across various family and couple types."
0,"The second wave of the U.S. sex workers rights movement began in the late 1990s. Yet with the passage of the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, anti-sex trafficking discourse has conflated sex work and prostitution, advocating an abolitionist stance (Agustín 2005, Weitzer 2007). Ethnographic research with the umbrella sex workers rights organization, Desiree Alliance (DA), reveals how sex worker rights activists address sex trafficking and attempt to involve themselves in anti-sex trafficking efforts. I draw from social movement research on sex worker rights efforts that show that collaboration with non-sex worker entities and/or policy-makers is crucial for sex worker rights organizations to be successful. I further draw from sex work scholars who critique the dominance of abolitionist anti-sex trafficking ideology. Through observations at the 2010 DA national conference, combined with 20 semi-structured interviews with leading DA members across the country, I find activists often find it difficult to join anti-sex trafficking efforts due to the perceived stigma against sex workers and experiences of marginalization, and so instead work from within their own organizations to address the issue. They perceive anti sex-trafficking organizations to be oppositional, unwelcoming, or uninterested in their experiences and perspectives. I argue that the lack of collaboration hinders efforts sex worker rights activists’ desires for national level legal change such as decriminalization or legalization. Further, it appears that the TVPA is harmful to sex worker activist efforts."
0,"Present day narratives on and around cloning are often embedded in the polarized narratives of, on the one hand, a dystopian future of excessive social control and, on the other, a benevolent future wherein human suffering is alleviated through new kinds of therapeutics.  As different as these may appear, both use the same narrative structure in which technoscientific objects are projected into a predetermined - and often remarkably socially familiar - future.  Both narratives make the consequences of cloning for human futures central.  In turn, animals become representatives of the consequences cloning may have for humans.  In turn, cloned animals are deemed de facto as unproblematic.  In order to both problematize this discourse and think about alternative ways to conceptualizing the meanings of cloning(s), this paper employs the symbolic interactionist concepts of social worlds and situational maps to explore the humans, nonhumans, sites, institutions, epistemic communities, practices, and discourses that converge when animals of endangered species are cloned.  I contend that the stakes of cloning can be alternatively articulated when this practice is conceptualized as situated action.  Specifically, I show how the endeavor to clone animals of endangered species is made possible by transposing the technical mediations used in one type of human-animal relations to another, which links up heterogeneous human and animal ontologies in complex ways.  I position these connections as important junctures that illuminate the kinds of stakes that various humans and nonhumans have in cloning endeavors."
0,"For reasons that are not yet entirely clear more people are volunteering in some urban areas than others. In this research, we test three theories (demographic, institutional, and cultural) that account for variation in several types of volunteering among metropolises. We use hierarchical nonlinear modeling techniques with a nationally representative Current Population Survey data on nearly 200,000 respondents living within 257 urban areas. We find that general volunteering is influenced by household composition, family poverty, race heterogeneity, nonprofit organizations, congregations, and the foreign born population. The religious volunteer rate is influenced by household composition and the number of religious congregations in an area. The secular volunteer rate is influenced by the proportion of students, family poverty, race heterogeneity, nonprofit organizations, and the proportion foreign born."
0,"Although recent increases in imprisonment are concentrated in poor Black communities, we know little about how daily life within these neighborhoods is affected. Almost all ethnographic work in poor minority neighborhoods was written before the expansion of the criminal justice system, and the bulk of research on ""mass imprisonment"" relies on survey data, field experiments, or interviews, conceptualizing its impact in terms of current or former felons and their families. Drawing on six years of fieldwork in Philadelphia, this article shifts the focus from imprisonment and criminal records to the increase in policing and supervision in poor Black neighborhoods, and what this has meant for a growing status group of wanted people. For many young men, avoiding jail has become a daily preoccupation: they have warrants out for minor infractions, like failing to pay court fees or braking curfew, and will be detained if they are identified. Such threat of imprisonment transforms social relations by undermining already tenuous attachments to family, work, and community. But young men also rely on their precarious legal standing to explain failures that would have occurred anyway, while girlfriends and neighbors exploit their wanted status as an instrument of social control. I discuss the implications of my ethnographic observations relative to prior treatments of the poor and policing, and with regard to broader sociological questions about punishment and surveillance in the modern era."
0,"The experience of rural poverty, although it has much in common with the urban setting, is nonetheless unique.  This paper looks in depth at the choices that the rural poor make in order to survive and cope with low incomes and unemployment.  Based on qualitative interviews and ethnographic research, it argues that in a small, tight-knit community, the actions and behaviors of the poor are subject to greater social scrutiny than in an urban area.  The insularity and lack of anonymity in the field site means that everyones family history and current situation is known, and reputations are extremely important in deciding the degree of social support a person or family receives.  Reputations and community standing are also very influential in determining who will be considered for the few available jobs.  Behaviors and coping mechanisms that are commonly practiced in urban settings, and that may be economically rational, can thus be irrational in the rural setting.  The importance of local cultural norms, and the heightened degree of social censure for those who do not exhibit adherence to these norms, exerts pressure on the rural poor to choose only coping strategies that are culturally acceptable, regardless of their economic rationality.  This finding helps explain the propensity for self-provisioning and subsistence activities among the rural poor, as well as the lower incidence of welfare use and illegal activities in the rural setting."
0,"Collective identity formation is important because it plays a crucial role in sustaining movements over time. Studying collective identity formation in autonomous groups in the Global Justice Movement poses a challenge because they encompass a multiplicity of identities, ideologies, issues, frames, collective action repertoires, and organizational forms. This article analyzes the process of collective identity formation in three anti-capitalist globalization groups in Madrid, Spain, based on 3 years of ethnographic fieldwork. The author argues that for new groups practicing participatory democracy the regular face-to-face assemblies are the crucial arena in which collective identity can form and must be both effective and participatory in order to foster a sense of commitment and belonging. The article raises the possibility that scholars should consider what seems to be an oxymoron: the possible benefits of ""failure"" for social movements."
0,"By what mechanisms has China's developing capitalist labor market been producing stratification patterns of reemployment and wage differences among laid-off workers in the late 1990s? Theoretical perspectives delineating state, market, and societal mechanisms are used to guide exploratory analyses of data from a sample of workers who were laid off from state-owned textile enterprises in the Tianjin municipality. Three findings are reported. First, men with what Portes defined as downward leveling ""negative social capital"" are less likely to become reemployed. A second, more tenuous, finding is that workers with a higher level of education are more likely to be reemployed. Third, workers with a social network tie to at least one official from a government administrative agency are more likely to be reemployed and, among those reemployed, more likely to earn higher wages, as compared to workers with a social network tie to at least one official from a state-owned enterprise or workers lacking a social network tie to any official. This third finding, along with reports of analogous findings culled from a review of published literature, stimulates us to go beyond the data to theoretically speculate about how Chinese officialdom has become somewhat more differentiated and consequent ramifications for understanding newly emerging changes in China's stratification order."
0,"Research on philanthropy has not sufficiently examined whether charitable giving to religious causes impinges on giving to secular causes. Examining three waves of national panel data, we find that the relationship between religious and secular giving is generally not of a zero-sum nature; families that increase their religious giving also increase their secular giving. We argue that this finding is best accounted for by a practice theory of social action which emphasizes how religious congregations foster skills and practices related to charitable giving. We also argue that denominational variation in the influence of religious giving is best accounted for by the financial structuring of the denomination. We conclude with the implications for studies of religious causal influence more generally."
0,"Data from 44 societies are used to explore sex segregation by field of study. Contrary to accounts linking socioeconomic modernization to a ""degendering"" of public-sphere institutions, sex typing of curricular fields is stronger in more economically developed contexts. The authors argue that two cultural forces combine in advanced industrial societies to create a new sort of sex segregation regime. The first is gender-essentialist ideology, which has proven to be extremely resilient even in the most liberal-egalitarian of contexts; the second is self-expressive value systems, which create opportunities and incentives for the expression of ""gendered selves."" Multivariate analyses suggest that structural features of postindustrial labor markets and modern educational systems support the cultivation, realization, and display of gender-specific curricular affinities."
0,"Drawing upon a year of ethnographic research conducted in Memphis, Tennessee including participant observation at sites of the production of Hip-Hop culture in Memphis and 35 in-depth interviews with consumers and producers of the local Hip-Hop scene, this paper will situate the underground Hip-Hop scene in Memphis as an art world that engages not only in the production of culture, but in the protection of culture against co-optation as well. I will engage how notions of authenticity and consciousness contribute to the production and consumption of Hip-Hop in Memphis. Finally, I will utilize the phenomenology of Memphis as a place to illuminate the processes by which participants in the citys Hip-Hop art world negotiate history, consciousness, authenticity, and Hip-Hop culture in Memphis and beyond."
0,"The last decade has witnessed an outpouring of interest in childrens emotional and behavioral problems from media outlets, the medical profession, and allied mental health disciplines. Little scholarly attention has been given to how the diverse claims of these stakeholders are used by adults to construct a lay understanding of childrens mental health problems.  Drawing on social constructionist and claims-making traditions, we analyze the competing frameworks that emerge in public discourse on childrens emotional and behavioral problems.  Specifically, using vignette-based data from the 2002 General Social Surveys National Stigma Study  Children Module, we conduct a latent class analysis of causal attributions for three types of childhood problems: daily trouble, ADHD, and depression.  We then evaluate the predictors of those attributions, including characteristics of the child, whether respondents label the problem a mental illness, and respondents socio-demographic characteristics.  We find that adults construct childrens mental health problems in a manner consistent with public frameworks.  And, while socio-demographic characteristics do little to predict group differences, several interesting patterns emerge with regard to the characteristics of the child."
0,"European Union (EU) enlargement--the geographical and cultural expansion of the EU--raises fundamental sociological questions about Europe's borders, boundaries, and identity. On the one hand, EU residents relatively support enlargement as an abstract policy. On the other hand, they voice strong opposition to some EU candidates’ proposed entries, such as Turkey’s. In light of this seeming “issue inconsistency,” this paper asks to what extent and why citizens support EU enlargement, but oppose the actual candidate countries’ entries (as of 2006: Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Macedonia). Through descriptive and multinomial logistic regression analyses of two waves of Eurobarometer data (2005 and 2006), it finds that the extent to which EU residents support enlargement but oppose candidates’ entries varies greatly across EU candidates and among EU member states. Traditional psychological-political and interest-based models cannot fully account for these patterns, and in light of this, we argue that issue inconsistency can be a way of drawing symbolic boundaries between people and among countries in the EU. In line with this framework, we find that EU citizens’ support for enlargement but opposition to candidates’ entries is a product of their symbolic and cognitive attachment to the EU and their countries’ geographical proximity to candidate states. These findings reflect newly admitted EU member states’ citizens' attempts to maintain their middle position in a hierarchy of “European-ness” vis a vis geographically proximate EU—and not yet quite “European”—candidate states, particularly Turkey. Implications are discussed."
0,"Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue. Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"This article examines the effects of market specialization on economic and social outcomes. Integrating two perspectives, we explore why products that span multiple categories suffer social and economic disadvantages. According to the audience-side perspective, audience members refer to established categories to make sense of products. Products that incorporate features from multiple categories are perceived to be pool fits Mill category expectations and less appealing than category specialists. The producer-side view holds that spanning categories reduces one ability to effectively target each category's audience, which decreases appeal to audience members. Rather than treating these as rival explanations, A,e propose that both processes matter and offer a systematic, integrated account of how penalties arise as a consequence of audience-side and producer side processes. We analyze data from two dissimilar contexts, eBay auctions and U.S. future-film projects, to test the central implications of our theory Together these tests provide support for our integrated approach and suggest that both processes contribute to the penalties associated with category spanning."
0,"Numerous studies examine the causal factors of entrance into prostitution and find economic marginalization, substance addiction, and interpersonal networks are common reasons women enter the trade. However, we know less about the role that age of onset plays in shaping female pathways into prostitution. Here, we build from insights into previous research by analyzing not only entry pathways but also how age categories are linked to time spent in the trade and whether the length of time in prostitution exacts a greater ""toll"" on women. Drawing from the feminist and age of onset literatures, we analyze 40 in-depth interviews with female street prostitutes from five U.S. cities. Our results underscore the importance of age as an organizing feature of women's pathways into prostitution and the potential associated consequences of working in this trade."
0,"This research compares between two separate socio-economic studies in two small communities in two different countries, namely (Al Hayer) in the United Arab Emirates, and (LeMars) in the United State of America. Both studies used the same questionnaire, which was designed by a team from the Department of Sociology at Iowa State Universities (ISU) when they studied LeMars of Iowa in mid nineties of the last century. The second study was done on Al Hayer community in the United Arab Emirates in 2004."
0,"According to the national Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), between 10% and 90% of women in poorer countries agree that domestic violence against women is justified. Such wide variation in women's responses raises concerns about the comparability of the underlying attitudinal question, and the validity of comparative research that assumes comparability. Using 67 DHS conducted in 48 countries between 1995 and 2007, we explored whether cross-national variation in women's affirmative responses to this question were explained by cross-national variation in survey design, socioeconomic conditions, or both. Variation in survey design had considerable predictive power and accounted for a non-trivial amount of the variance in women's affirmative responses. Including the survey-design variables also modestly altered associations of the outcome with structural variables of interest in comparative studies. These findings offer insights about future analyses and data collections on women's attitudes about domestic violence against women. "
0,"Are people quick to adopt status beliefs about a social difference that lead them to treat others unequally? In a test of status construction theory, two experiments show that men and women form equally strong status beliefs from only two encounters with others. Men act powerfully on these new beliefs in their next encounters with others but women do not, possibly because women Ace greater social risks for acting oil ambiguous status advantages. Women are just as likely as men, however, to treat someone unequally on the basis of an established status distinction. This suggests that men are first movers in the emergence of status distinctions, but women eventually adopt the distinctions as well. Our results show that people readily transform social differences into status distinctions-distinctions that act as formidable forces of inequality."
0,"The authors study education and cognitive ability as predictors of female age at first birth (AFB), using monozygotic and dizygotic female twin pairs from the Middle-Aged Danish Twin survey. Using mediated regression, they replicate findings linking education ( and not cognitive ability) to AFB. But in a behavior genetic model, both relationships are absorbed within a latent variable measuring the shared family environment. Two interpretations are relevant. First, variance in AFB emerges from differences between families, not differences between sisters within the same family. Second, even in a natural laboratory sensitive to genetic variance in female fertility during demographic transition-the variance in AFB was non-genetic, located instead within the shared environment."
0,"This paper engages with sociological theorizing on political talk and deliberation. Is it indeed organizations that impact customs of political talk in groups (Lichterman; Eliasoph), or is it that, in the absence of deliberation as a social field, people will model their talk in public in relation to established practices and familiar conversation styles (Ryfe; Polletta)?  Observing an activist group assembled via the internet and, hence, not constrained by organizational pressures, I analyze how the group participants make sense of political talk. I find that the group does involve in discussions but define them as residual to action. Featured discussions are modeled on talk typical of a classroom, and open-ended, argumentative and elevated talk is seen as less significant than fact-laden lectures. I also notice the groups perceptions of its blog: it remains silent even though defined as a proper space for discussion.  Thus even in the absence of direct organizational constraints, the group strives to make talk meaningful and does it by modeling it on established talk practices. I conclude by suggesting the importance of comparative analysis of group conversation models and their potential for opening up space for informal political talk, formation of collective identity and bonding."
0,"What do sociologists mean when they describe culture as founded on ""shared understandings""? Sharing an understanding does not necessarily imply having the same opinions but rather agreeing on the structures of relevance and opposition that make symbols and actions meaningful. Because meaning is contextual, different people might interpret the same reality in different ways. Yet standard quantitative sociological methods are not designed to take such heterogeneity into account. In this article, I introduce a new method-relational class analysis-that uses attitudinal data to identify groups of individuals that share distinctive ways of understanding the same domain of social activity. To demonstrate its utility I use it to reexamine the cultural omnivore thesis. I find that Americans' understandings of the social symbolism of musical taste are shaped by three competing logics of cultural distinction, in a manner that complicates contemporary sociological accounts of artistic taste."
0,"Evidence indicates that exposure to news media sources is related to individuals’ opinions on criminal justice issues.  However, previous research is limited in two ways: its focus on local television news to the near exclusion of other news media outlets, and its focus on whites’ opinions to the near exclusion of other racial and ethnic groups.  This paper builds on previous work by examining the relationship between whites’ and blacks’ news exposure patterns and support for punishment policy.   It examines a variety of news genres in tandem, including local television, network television, cable television, daily print newspapers and online news sources.  It also probes a host of punishment preferences, including support for three strikes, mandatory minimums, sentence enhancements, truth in sentencing, trying juveniles as adults and capital punishment.    Analysis of the Race Cues, Attitudes and Punitiveness Survey (2009) indicates that among whites, viewing increasing amounts of local television news is positively related to support for punitive policies, while increasing readership of daily print newspapers is negatively associated with punitiveness.  The amount of exposure to network television, cable television and online news sources is unrelated to whites’ punishment preferences.  In contrast to the findings for whites, none of the news sources studied are consistently related to the punitive sentiments of blacks.  Potential mechanisms accounting for these findings are offered and several avenues for future research are highlighted."
0,"Why do some women call themselves feminists while others do not? Scholars studying feminist identity tend to focus only on the identities of women who are members of feminist organizations, or to assume that all women who agree with feminist ideas identify themselves as feminists. Tests of this assumption, however, have proven disappointing. I trace the history of this hypothesis, and using Jane Mansbridge and Aldon Morris' theory of oppositional consciousness, to develop my own. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), I test both hypotheses. I find that ideas do not matter; oppositional consciousness, not feminist ideology, is the key variable that conditions women's feminist identification."
0,"This article argues that unemployment benefits are providing a crucial but often overlooked function by reducing the insecurity associated with modern labor markets. Because job insecurity is associated with concerns about future financial security, economic support during unemployment may lessen the negative effects of job insecurity on employed individuals' well-being. Using data from the European Social Survey, this article shows that the generosity of unemployment benefits makes a difference to the subjective well-being of employed individuals, especially those with limited economic resources and an insecure position in the labor market. These results indicate that unemployment benefits may be viewed as a collective resource with important external benefits, i.e., benefits to society over and above those to the unemployed who directly utilize such benefits."

0,"The rule of law has been an important component within the criminal justice system.  The Bill of Rights was created to protect citizens from abusive government power.  There are notable incidents justifying the need for Constitutional protections as reflected by the 1940's internment of the Japanese population, the 1950s ""Red Scare,"" and the FBI COINTELPRO programs that were prominent during the 1960s.  These precedents ultimately culminate with the circumstances surrounding  9-11 and the implementation of the USA Patriot Act.  This paper will begin exploring some of the threads tying governmental policy in the second half of the twentieth century with anti-terrorist legislation since 2001 reflecting a renewed form of restricted civil liberties."
0,"It has been suggested that athletes are the recipients of a halo effect (Coakley, 1998), whereby achievement on the playing field is assumed to carry over to other areas of the athletes life.  However, no solid empirical research has been conducted on whether such a halo effect is extended to teacher perceptions of the academic investment of high school varsity athletes.  This is particularly important to investigate, given research that finds that teachers expectations can influence their perceptions regarding student ability and performance, which can potentially influence student achievement. For this reason, we investigate whether teacher bias exists, in any direction, in comparisons of their perceptions of student athletes and non-athletes. In addition, it is our belief that there is no singular sport experience, either between the genders or when looking at different types of sports.  For this reason, we will examine males and females separately and look at the specific type of sport in which student athletes are involved utilizing the eighth and tenth grade waves of the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Our primary research question is: net of student background, school context, and academic achievement variables, are student athletes differentially assessed by teachers in terms of their academic investment?"
0,"This paper reconsiders Habermass notion of technology as ideology in the context of contemporary political culture. It argues that the methodological and substantive contours of Habermass framework are still valid today. However, the role that technology plays as ideology has changed dramatically in the context of contemporary capitalism. No longer does it provide a legitimation for the political administration of the economy; instead, it legitimizes a new, neoliberal regime, whereby political intervention in the workings of the market is highly prohibited. This paper illustrates this point by few examples from contemporary discourse on information technology, or the digital discourse. It shows how neoliberal tenet regarding the workings of the market are rearticulated as technological facts, and there political undercurrents are neutralize. According to this digital discourse, with information technology the promise of a self-regulating market has been materialized. As the market become more rational by the force of information technology it also gains and further deserves more autonomy from political intervention. This new (information) technology as ideology, therefore, legitimizes the insulation of the market from political intervention and further neoliberal political goals."
0,"Dominant theories of urban change do not do a good job of predicting what paths smaller metro areas in the United States have taken over the latter part of the twentieth century.  In this paper, I analyze what attributes of urban areas most affect changes in population and median household income during the period 1970 to 2000, focusing on 80 smaller metro areas.  Using fixed effects regression analyses, I show that while the predictions of some researchers prove accurate  such as the importance of immigration streams and higher education  the smaller places in this study also illustrate that other predictions  primarily about employment levels in specific sectors  do not hold true.  According to many prominent theories of urban change, smaller metro areas should not see increases in income levels based on higher wages or based on jobs in high end services or the FIRE (finance, insurance and real estate) industries; nonetheless, the smaller places on paths of success illustrate just that.  And although growth is more concentrated in the West and South of the United States, region does not dictate success overall for this group; instead, region appears to be a historically contingent correlate to success."
0,"Recent research has conceptualized sustainability as the environmental efficiency of wellbeing (EWEB). This concept takes into account the benefits societies are able to produce from their demands on the environment. Research along these lines indicates that countries vary widely in the efficiency with which they transform the Earth's resources into well-being. Here, we take up this finding as a puzzle to be explained. We construct a new measure of EWEB using the ecological footprint per capita (a measure of environmental consumption) and average life satisfaction (a measure of subjective well-being). We draw hypotheses from political economy, modernization, and sustainable consumption theories in the environmental social sciences. Using full information maximum likelihood estimation, we test the effects of climate, political, economic, and social factors on EWEB with a sample of 105 countries. Key findings include a negative quadratic effect of economic development on EWEB, a negative effect of income inequality, and a positive effect of social capital. "
0,"Queuing and threat theories are two prominent sociological theories which explain how the relative size of minority groups affects the labor market outcomes of those groups. Because these theories generate opposite predictions about the effects of relative minority group size, researchers have often suggested that evidence supporting one theory must contradict the other. In this paper, I suggest that these two theories are based on different underlying mechanisms: threat theories suggest that employers preferences respond to minority group size, while queuing theories suggest that the processes of worker-job matching are affected by minority group size. I combine these two theories into one model of how minority group size affects labor market outcomes, generate predictions from this model, and test the effects of black representation in labor queues and metropolitan areas on the average quality of jobs held by black and white workers."
0,"It is often assumed that international graduate students are ineffective in teaching.  Some popular press and undergraduate students say that English with non-American accents and culturally distinct teaching and communication styles negatively impacts students’ learning experience (Crittenden 1994).  Researchers and the media have labeled this issue as the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) problem. Due to public criticism voiced by dissatisfied student consumers, since the 1980s, this ITA problem has become one of the most controversial matters in U.S. higher education.  Past studies on this topic have concentrated on investigating undergraduate students’ attitudes and satisfaction towards their international graduate student instructors.  Findings from the studies imply that universities and/or departments should focus on the needs of undergraduate students, emphasizing the assimilation of international graduate student instructors to the cultures of both the U.S. and American universities.  Less is known about how international graduate student instructors see themselves as teachers or their role as instructors.  As a result, the notion of the ITA problem remains unchallenged, and the ways to help international graduate student instructors from their point of view are not well incorporated.  The lack of knowledge prevents us from understanding whether the experiences of international graduate students are different from U.S. born graduate student instructors.  Using semi-structured interviews we will examine the perceptions, experiences, and strategies employed by graduate students enrolled in a large mid-western university."

We examine the financial, technological, and political dynamics that have globalized the world economy since the beginnings of capitalism over 500 years ago through the prism of the worlds largest iron ore mine, Carajas in the Brazilian Amazon.  Our goals in this paper are a) to understand the profoundly local characteristics of Carajás, an enormous and very local hole in the ground, in pristine jungle remote from industry, dug by enormous machines to extract huge volumes of raw material to send to industrial centers half-way around the world in huge trains and ships; b) to explain how local processesdriven by capital, shaped by matter and space, and mediated by technologyare materially intensified and spatially expanded toward globalization; and c) to examine the local and global consequences of these processes."
0,"This article explores the effects of language differences on dynamics among youth athletes. Fifteen hours of participant observation were conducted with a youth soccer team, supplemented by five interviews with the coach and with players' parents. With a cohort consisting of a Spanish- and English-speaking bilingual coach, one fully bilingual player and another partly bilingual player, two Spanish-only-speaking players, and four English-only-speaking players, there were opportunities for many different types of interactions. This article specifically focuses on how language differences served as a catalyst for the creation of exclusionary practices by the adults surrounding the team. However, these practices did not determine the team's culture; rather, there was both accommodation and resistance on the part of the players to those practices of exclusion that the adults had introduced."
0,"Both education and religious involvement provide beneficial resources that can positively impact health and mortality outcomes. However, it is unclear whether these important resources work in concert to influence mortality risk. Indeed, religious resources are often placed in opposition to secular knowledge, and this may limit the scope of the positive influence of religious factors on health outcomes. The present study relies on a large (N = 22,080), nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized U.S. adults (National Health Interview Survey-Cancer Risk Factor Supplement) administered in 1987 and linked to the National Death Index through 2006 to test this relationship. Cox proportional hazard estimates suggest that religious involvement has a negative impact on the risk of mortality for those who did not complete college. However, estimates show that religious participation increases the risk of mortality among those with the highest levels of educational attainment."
0,"Existing cross-national research on educational attainment does not fully address whether the same level of educational attainment generates the same level of literacy skills in different countries. We analyze literacy skills data for young adults from 19 countries in the 1994-1998 International Adult Literacy Survey and find that in all countries, individuals with a higher level of educational attainment tend to have greater literacy skills. However, there is substantial variation across countries in the size of literacy gaps by levels of educational attainment. In particular, young adults in the United States show the largest literacy gaps. Using two-level hierarchical linear models, we find that cross-national differences in the literacy gap between more- and less-educated individuals are systematically linked to the degree of between-school inequality in school resources (instructional materials, class size, teachers' experience and certification)."
0,"Is living in a higher percentage same-race neighborhood beneficial for emotional well-being? This study explores this relationship for Blacks and Hispanics and examines whether social support explains this relationship using a random sample of Illinois residents. Living in a higher percentage same-race neighborhood improves the emotional well-being of Blacks and Hispanics; although, it is related to different aspects of emotional well-being. Social support explains part of this relationship for Blacks. The implication of this study is that neighborhoods confer not only economic resources to their residents, but social and emotional resources as well."
0,"Excessive work hours can be detrimental to workers and their families, thus it is important to understand how long work hours are generated within a variety of contexts.  Recent studies focus on professional and managerial employees.  In contrast, this paper explores the meanings of overtime among a blue-collar, manufacturing workforce at an auto parts plant in the U.S. manufacturing Midwest.  Maximizing income is a powerful incentive for workers at the plant to accept and seek overtime work.  Yet, we argue that interests in income maximization present only one cultural ""face"" of overtime.  In addition, working overtime is embedded within meaningful social relations in the plant and offers workers an opportunity to transgress the status order outside of the factory."
0,"Until very recently in Rhode Island, indoor prostitution was legal while street prostitution was not.  As Melissa Farley put it, “the pimp-messaged propaganda that indoor prostitution is safer than outdoor prostitution is like insisting that even though the plantation system is slavery, because the house girls have it better than the field girls, they are not slaves”.  The analogy used by Farley is apt and bears further examination. This paper will review the origins of the Rhode Island law, the differential enforcement of the “house girls” – indoor prostitutes versus the “field girls” – street prostitutes, and the recent changes to Rhode Island’s prostitution laws. To understand how the law controls and views two forms of one type of behavior- prostitution, this research uses the insights of Donald Black’s work on the behavior of law to focus in on the varying ways the law behaved and currently behaves in Rhode Island as it applies to prostitution. Black’s five sociological factors that determine how the law behaves are used to explain the disparity in how indoor and street prostitution were viewed for decades in Rhode Island.  Stratification, morphology, culture, organization, and social control are used to examine the social factors that brought about the recent changes in the law. A test of Black’s theory is conducted using information gathered from an online survey of sexual service providers.  Results from the study provide insights that can inform policy as well as policing practices and strategies."
0,"We examine immigrant generation differences in college attendance and college type among youth ages 18 through 26 who have graduated from a US. high school. Results indicate that first and second-generation immigrants are significantly more likely to attend college than their third-plus generation counterparts of similar race/ethnicity, socioeconomic and family background characteristics. While parental behaviors and expectations for college attendance do not significantly mediate these generational differences, these factors appear to indirectly affect college-going behavior through their impact on students' verbal ability and academic achievement during high school. Interaction models including race/ethnicity and generation status reveal that the second-generation effects on college attendance are largely driven by Chinese youth, whereas the first-generation effects on college attendance are largely driven by black immigrant students."
0,"Using data from the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) 1977-2000, we examine sex segregation in a paradigmatic female-dominated occupation-nursing. We find that contrary to the vertical pattern of occupational stratification implied by the ""glass escalator,"" men are not disproportionately represented in administrative posts. Instead, we find a pervasive pattern of horizontal sex segregation, whereby men and women are disproportionately clustered in particular gendered specialties. Using in-depth interviews with a sample of registered nurses, we show that male nurses tend to gravitate toward areas of nursing they perceive to be more "" masculine."" Our findings have implications for other female-dominated occupations because the bottom-heavy structure of most occupations limits the number of men ( as well as women) from reaching the top positions within the field, meaning that horizontal sorting processes of acclimation sort most male employees in female-dominated professions."
0,"A large body of work indicates that female-dominated jobs pay less than gender-integrated jobs. Only a handful of studies have analyzed differences in access to flexible work arrangements between female-dominated and integrated jobs, and their findings are inconclusive. The current study draws on national data to explore differences in access to flexible work scheduling by the gender composition of women’s and men’s jobs. I find that those who work in integrated occupations, industries, or jobs are more likely to have access to flexible scheduling. Compensating wage differentials do not explain differences in access to flexible scheduling, as women and men do not take jobs with lower pay in return for greater access to flexibility. Instead, jobs with higher pay offer greater flexibility. Men who have female supervisors are more likely to have access to flexible scheduling, but women who have female supervisors are not more likely to have access to flexible scheduling. Despite popular perceptions, female-dominated jobs do not offer greater flexibility to women or to men."
0,"The U.S. census data reveal high concentrations of same-sex unmarried partners in areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. In this article, I consider whether the above-average prevalence rates of same-sex unmarried partners along the U.S.-Mexico border can be attributed to measurement error. whether they provide evidence of enclave-like areas for Hispanic same-sex partners, or some combination thereof. Drawing on descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses, I examine data validity issues, as well as possible explanations for the high presence of gay men and lesbians in these particular residential locations. In doing so, I pay particular attention to the role of ethnicity, language, and household size in creating potential measurement error, as well as in generating attractive enclave characteristics. These findings provide insight into both the validity of the U.S. census data on same-sex unmarried partners, as well as the role of the intersection of sexual orientation and Hispanic ethnicity in determining residential choice. Although undoubtedly measurement error is a contributing factor, findings nonetheless Support the existence of actual gay and lesbian enclaves and further suggest that immigration could play a role in generating these high concentration areas.

0,"In this paper, we present a study of labor market impacts of highly skilled immigration in the United States. We apply a multi-level methodology to analyze the 2000 U.S. Census data to examine whether higher presence of skilled immigrants affects negatively the earnings of native (and immigrant) workers in skilled jobs. The results indicate that the earnings effects of the nativity composition of location-specific jobs are not linear. For the overwhelming majority of native men and women percent foreign born in a job is positively associated with earnings. But there is a tipping point after which more immigrants result in earnings decline. The findings highlight the importance of structural features of employment of highly skilled native and foreign-born workers."
0,"Using statistical models for multiple social networks we explore the interplay between hierarchies, social networks and organizational identities within an international multiunit organization. We approach this analytical task guided by three main orienting questions about (i) the implications of the mutually constitutive character of interpersonal and interorganizational relations within multiunit organizations; (ii) the way in which network multiplexity affects the formation of social ties across organizational units, and (iii)  the role of social selection processes in bridging decentralized organizational units. The results indicate that the informal organizational hierarchy is dependent to some degree upon the formal inter-personal organizational structure but also on particular attributes, in particular identities, of the individuals in the network. For instance, inter-personal hierarchy within the organization is significantly associated with the presence of informal hierarchy ties from superiors to subordinates, but not vice versa. Regarding the attributes of individuals and the informal social hierarchy, embedded within the informal hierarchy are individuals who identify with the organizational group but not the individual companies of which organization is comprised. These individuals are those most likely to develop strong communication ties across organizational boundaries, even allowing for the fact that there is a major effect for strong ties to occur within individual companies. Finally, we find evidence of the fact that salient individuals within the informal hierarchy are those who have lower company tenure but higher organizational group tenure."
0,"The absence of a strong sociological tradition in regard to the study of war creates a serious lacuna in our understanding of violence and inter-societal relations. I outline an explicitly sociological perspective on war, using the “first principles” of the sociological imagination. I argue war is an institution that flourishes in conditions of anarchy, which requires us to critically examine the role of force and coercion in social life, and the institutional structures necessary for domestic and inter-societal peace. These ruminations highlight the contradictory nature of the state with respect to political violence, both domestic and international, and the relationship between war and the culture of masculinity. Efforts to create a more peaceful world require a direct challenge to the institutions of war and national sovereignty, and to the voices that demand we “support the troops” and the imperatives of war. It also requires us to imagine a new political organization of the world with a central authority sufficiently strong to effectively prevent successful resort to political violence in humanity’s internecine struggles."
0,"The present study draws on sociological theories of mental health and a multidisciplinary neighborhood-effects literature to examine the effects of neighborhood context on adolescent psychological distress.  This study examines the direct impacts of the structural characteristics of neighborhoods on psychological distress, and the indirect effects of the neighborhood structural context through its influence on personal resources and perceptions, which function as intervening mechanisms.  Specifically, this study explores how the process of neighborhood contextual effects on adolescent psychological distress is moderated by race and ethnicity.   Multilevel (hierarchical) linear models were estimated using data from two waves (1994/95 and 1996) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health, n=8,192).  Results suggest that certain aspects of neighborhood context indirectly influence adolescent psychological distress through their impact on perceived emotional support and aspirations/expectations for the future, both of which are associated with lower levels of psychological distress.  In particular, neighborhood physical disorder is associated with lower levels of perceived emotional support (except for African Americans), and for Hispanic adolescents a higher concentration of Hispanics in the neighborhood is associated with higher perceived emotional support.  Concentrated advantage and the proportion of Hispanics in a neighborhood are positively associated with future expectations, while neighborhood racial diversity and physical disorder (except for African Americans) are negatively associated with future expectations."
0,"How do sociologists know that they are reading a good ethnography, or alternately, that they have produced one? In this paper, I argue that, while it is difficult to devise standard criteria for evaluating ethnographies due to the firmly qualitative nature of the method and the range of approaches and styles employed, such a task is necessary and worthwhile. Previous efforts at devising evaluative criteria have either focused on how to assess the merits of data alone or have argued that ethnographic accounts should be assessed according to general social scientific criteria of validity and relevance. I argue that such evaluative tools do not hold ethnography to high enough standards and that ethnographic accounts should be assessed according to criteria specific to the method. I propose six criteria by which ethnographic accounts, regardless of their specific methodology, may be evaluated. I then apply these criteria to a range of classic and contemporary ethnographies to demonstrate how such evaluation might be accomplished in practice."
0,"In this study, the author evaluates some of the key assertions of the segmented assimilation theory by examining the generational pattern of achievement among Latino high school students. Segmented assimilation theory posits that the outcomes of immigrants will not necessarily improve monotonically across generations, especially in disadvantaged contexts, and that maintaining familial and ethnic ties can have a protective effect on immigrant students. The author tests these ideas by examining variation in the generational pattern of achievement in low-income schools among Latino high school students. The author finds that changes in achievement across generations generally follow a pattern of classical assimilation with small, though not statistically significant, improvements in achievement from the first to the second generation and from the second to the third generation in both poor and nonpoor schools. Contrary to hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory, the author finds no evidence of ""downward assimilation"" across generations among Latinos attending low-income schools."
0,"Student level data on participation in classroom discourse and student effort on assignments in 117 middle school English classrooms are used to investigate the social determinants of student engagement in classroom instruction. Social identity theories of race, social class, and attachment to school, and research in the social psychology of achievement motivation both suggest differential levels of student engagement among diverse student groups. Using multilevel models, the author investigates the relationship between classroom context and students' levels of engagement. Levels of engagement among black and low SES students are mostly insensitive to classroom context, suggesting there is little collective action directed at fostering anti-school norms among these student groups. However, consistent with research in the social psychology of achievement motivation, students who begin class with weaker reading and writing skills are less likely to be engaged, setting the stage for a cycle of reduced achievement growth.

0,"It is imminent to nature of any organizational system to recognize a critical role of the human factor.  Organizations consist of humans and therefore, we need to treat each organization as a macro human being, ascribing it human features: intelligence, emotions, discipline, consideration, ability to control itself and influence others.  Emotional intelligence (EQ) is an important concept that determines both organizational and personal success.  Recent studies have indicated a significant relationship between a degree of emotional intelligence of organizations and their level of success.  Organizational success can be referred to as a combination of profitability, reputation and the level of prestige among its stakeholders.  Emotional Intelligence at a macro-level can be defined as organizational ability to intelligently handle matters with empathy.   In order to develop an emotionally intelligent organization, various steps and techniques can be undertaken.  It is critical to match knowledge sources, techniques, and tools in order implement an EQ program effectively.  This paper analyzes, compares and contrasts existing methods and tools of organizational EQ assessment.  It presents and discusses the EQ development model designed by Antora Consulting Group - an international management consulting firm."
0,"The author engages the sociological theory of ecologically unequal exchange to assess the extent to which levels of per capita anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are a function of the ""vertical flow"" of exports to high-income nations. Results of cross-national fixed effects panel model estimates indicate that levels of such emissions are positively associated with the vertical flow of exports, and the relationship is much more pronounced for lower-income countries than for high-income countries. Additional findings suggest that the observed relationship for lower-income nations has grown in magnitude through time, indicating that structural associations between high-income and lower-income countries have become increasingly ecologically unequal, at least in the context of greenhouse gas emissions. These results hold, net of various important controls. "
0,"Previous studies on the relationship between globalization and welfare state have concentrated on the general welfare efforts. However, in this paper, I examine the effect of globalization on health care sector which is one of the targets to reform as well as pension during the 1980s and 1990s in the 15 developed countries. The effects of globalization may be positive causing expansion, negative triggering crisis and reduction, curvilinear contributing to convergence, or insignificant. Concerning public health expenditure, both financial and productive globalization has negative effect with consideration of institutional legacies and the former is stronger than the latter in the advanced capitalist countries. Because private sector is already well developed in health care and it is closely related to market, globalization may have mountainous and negative effects on it."
0,"This article examines how coalition frames develop and what happens to that frame after the formal coalition ends. To that end, I analyze the frame shift around the 2004 March for Women's Lives (March). The March initially focused on established ideas of reproductive rights around which the four national mainstream co-sponsors previously organized. However, after a newer reproductive justice organization joined the coalition, material and organizing reflected a shift in framing to reproductive justice. How did this change happen? What are the impacts of this event for the women's movement? Through document analysis and interviews, I trace the negotiations that facilitated this framing shift. I argue that this new coalition frame translated into positive lasting changes in organizing for women's reproductive health even as the coalition dissolved and some of the tensions within the larger women's movement remain."
0,"The effects of prisons on rural America have been understudied leaving varied misconceptions and unexplained aspects of the prison town.  While some scholars have looked at national or state trends in prison construction, what we lack are theoretically informed concrete local studies.  In this study I propose a multi-method approach to investigate the prison town.  I also build a new theoretical approach for studying these rural towns by combining Taubs institutional actor analysis with Goffmans/Gamsons notion of frame analysis.  The goal of this study is to examine the causes of the shift from protesting the placement of prisons to advocating for their placement by small towns.  This study will also consider the subsequent effects prisons have on small towns.  Albeit most would argue small towns willingness to accept prisons is strictly based on their lack of resources and need for jobs, once sited the institution has political, social, and cultural ramification for the town.  This is the void this project seeks to fill.  While demand or willingness to accept prisons by rural towns does not necessarily dictate the market for prison expansion, the policy implications of this study could define the role of rural town in facilitating the expansion of the criminal justice system."
0,"Racial residential segregation has short- and long-term consequences for individuals and families.  Previous research has documented the ways in which segregation and spatial location function to influence life chances due to differential access to opportunity structures.  However, relatively little is known about the perceptions of residents who live in spatially isolated neighborhoods that have high levels of poverty.  We seek to gain a deeper understanding of how geographic isolation influences individuals and their sense of agency.  Through the use of in-depth interviews, respondents discuss subjects ranging from transportation to employment opportunities and outline the ways in which concentrated disadvantage influences their daily lives."
0,"The role played by parental wealth in facilitating the life chances and living standards of offspring is a topic of growing interest in stratification research. For working and middle class households much of their intervivos transfers to children is provided in the form of assistance with a home purchase. This paper examines the impact of parental wealth and transfers of wealth on several aspects of the homeownership decision - the timing of the purchase, the cost of the home, and the downpayment proportion, as well as living standards subsequent to the purchase. We utilize a unique data set from France which contains information on parental wealth and wealth transfers from both sets of parents of a couple. We correct for possible endogeneity of parental transfers and model the joint determination of the downpayment proportion and home value. The results make clear the complex pathways by which parental wealth influences the tenancy arrangements and living standards of offspring. "
0,"While enjoying high labor force participation rates among older workers by international standard, Japan is experiencing one of the rapidest population aging in the world. Its workforce is therefore projected to suffer from a major labor shortage in the decades ahead. Facilitating older workers labor force participations is imperative for the national economy in todays global economy at large and shortages of seasoned talent and skills among the workforce in particular. In balancing the needs of older population with the needs of the Japanese economy as a whole, Japanese government officials and policymakers will have to deal with three major policy challenges: 1) balancing out protecting social integration of the elderly and keeping up with the global economy, 2) younger-older and men-women trade-offs in the labor force participations, and 3) developing flexibilities in workplace that will benefit both older employees and employers in the competitive global market."
0,"Using a national sample of congregations, the current study builds upon Lincoln and Mamiya's (1990) argument of the institutional importance of black churches. It does so by suggesting that, all things being equal, black congregations are more likely than are white, Hispanic, and Asian congregations to engage in voter registration efforts; however, the greater involvement of black congregations, relative to congregations of other ethnic groups, in community organizing has much to do with the greater social justice orientation of black congregations."
0,"This paper used the theory of incomplete institutionalization (Cherlin, 1978) to explore the ways that the institutions of law and language affect lesbian headed households.  Using qualitative interview data and quantitative time use data gathered through Experience Sampling Method, the author uses a global measure of authoritative parenting, called parental involvement, to distinguish legal lesbian mothers from nonlegal lesbian mothers.  The concept parental involvement looks at the amount and type of time spent with the child, how frequently the parent thinks of the child and the levels of warmth and guidance that the parent feels while with the child.  This study uses a unique sample of six lesbian headed families with nine children, in that they were drawn from a larger, representative family study.  Findings indicate that lesbian mothers feel that the lack of appropriate terms for their family forms and relationships hampers their parenting, and that legal recognition reduces ambiguity in the parental role.  This study also shows that parents who share legal custody of their children tend to have higher scores of parental involvement as compared to parents in families where only one mother has legal rights.  In these single legal families, lesbian mothers have higher levels of parental involvement than their nonlegal partners.  This study indicates that the extension of legal parenting to both members of same-sex couples (through the use of second parent adoption) would increase the level of parental involvement for both parents."
0,"In this work, we examine the construction of gender among cohabiting couples across a variety of areas, including relationship progression, the household division of labor, and finances. Using semi-structured interviews with 30 working and middle class cohabiting couples, we assess whether their relationships, generally assumed to be nontraditional, are organized along egalitarian gender lines and how these relationships change in gendered ways as they progress. Preliminary results suggest that while some cohabiters organize their relationships in nontraditional ways, many vestiges of traditional relationships remain. While cohabiting women appear to be able to advance their relationships through initiating dates and suggesting living together as frequently as men, the marriage proposal remains a male domain. Additionally, although some couples say they are sharing the housework equally, more couples agree that it is the female partner who shoulders this burden, even when she works for pay as well. Finally, most cohabiting couples appear to be organizing their financial lives around the role of the male breadwinner, regardless of whether they have already achieved this ideal."
0,"This study examines the extent and causes of inequalities in information technology ownership and use between natives and immigrants in the United States, with particular focus on the role of English ability. The results indicate that, during the period 1997-2003, immigrants were significantly less likely to have access to or use a computer and the Internet. Moreover, the gap in IT usage widened during that period. Immigrants and natives who live in Spanish-speaking households are less likely than individuals living in English-speaking households to have access to or use IT Estimates using a measure of predicted English ability show that English ability is positively associated with IT access and use. The results suggest that much of the immigrant-native gap in IT usage is attributable to differences in English ability."
0,"Using a unique data set of 3-generation education information, in this article we extend the analysis of Greenhalgh [Greenhalgh, Susan, 1985. Sexual Stratification: The other side of 'growth with equity' in East Asia. Population and Development Review 11, 265-314] and study the question of intergenerational transmission of sex-specific differential treatments. The rich data are obtained from Taiwan's Panel Study of Family Dynamics project. As far as the macro pattern is concerned, we found that although there is a clear tendency of differential treatment against females in the old generation, this tendency is significantly weakened and nearly vanishes in the young generation. Furthermore, the supporting effect of senior siblings in the old generation becomes a crowding (resource-dilution) effect in the young generation. However, within each micro lineage, there is a mild ""habitus"" effect in the sense that parents who experienced gender-specific differential treatment tend to treat their children in a similar fashion. We find that parents' education contributes to the elimination of sex-based differential treatment, consistent with the finding in Thronton et al."
0,"Durkheim’s The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, a book that many consider to be Durkheim's finest work,  is also a provocative and surprising book.  Amidst the detailed and abundant descriptions of the religious practices of Australia’s totemic tribes, one encounters numerous mentions of the significant role of human blood in the religious rites.  The question I address in this paper is why Durkheim focused so much attention on the bloody rites of the Australian aboriginals?  My argument begins with the collective effervescence produced in gatherings in which intense physical actions are necessary and prominent components.  Today’s rituals, as Durkheim recognized, lack such intensity and are, in comparison, uninspiring.  There is, however, one key exception to this trend toward more physically restrained ritual practices.  Soldiers shed their blood for the larger group just as in Durkheim's analysis the Australian tribesmen would willingly pierce their thighs or submit to painful blows to their bodies. Their actions bring them closer to the center of the group, which in turn elevates their stature, and makes required some acknowledgment of appreciation from the group itself.   In our time, bloody rituals have become almost extinct but when blood is shed on our behalf such behavior transcends the usual routine of daily life and crosses over into the realm of the sacred."
0,"Evidence on the relationship between political contributions and legislators' voting behavior is marred by concerns about endogeneity in the estimation process. Using a legislator's offspring sex mix as a truly exogenous variable, we employ an instrumental variable estimation procedure to predict the effect of voting behavior on political contributions. Following previous research, we find that a legislator's proportion daughters has a significant effect on voting behavior for women's issues, as measured by score in the ""Congressional Record on Choice"" issued by NARAL Pro-Choice America. In the second stage, we make a unique contribution by demonstrating a significant impact of exogenous voting behavior on PAC contributions, lending further credibility to the hypothesis that Political Action Committees respond to legislators' voting patterns by ""rewarding"" political candidates that vote in line with the positions of the PAC, rather than affecting those same votes - at least in this high-profile policy domain.

0,"The following paper examines the sociological concept social capital as a predictor of school success.  Interviews were conducted with a statewide sample of parents of children primarily in the third grade.  Social capital was examined as a construct that differs among these parents by social class, race, income, and educational levels.  This construct was then further analyzed as a predictor of school success in English, Math, and Fourth Grade Readiness domains.  Results reveal that social capital varies among the different social groups, but its use as a predictor is inconclusive.  Suggestions for future research indicate that salient measures for social capital should still be explored."
0,"Part-time employment has been advocated as the principle means of achieving greater work-life balance for women, but to date we have no evidence of its impact on marital stability over other household divisions of labour. Here we use British, German and US panel data to explore whether womens part-time employment enhances or detracts from the work-life balance indicated by a stable relationship across countries representing different earner-carer and part-time work regimes. British and West German couples where the woman works full-time, not part-time, were least likely to divorce. US womens employment level did not alter divorce risk, but being childless predicted far more stable marriages. The evidence suggests the individualism of capitalism leads to an erosion of kinship ties across society and in the home and that the challenge for policy makers concerned with future economic growth is not how to reinforce the work incentives embedded within market economies, but how to promote the importance of care and kinship despite the market economy."
0,"American educational leaders and philosophers have long valued schooling for its role in preparing the nation's youth to be civically engaged citizens. Numerous studies have found a positive relationship between education and subsequent civic participation. However, little is known about possible variation in effects by selection into higher education, a critical omission considering education's expressed role as a key mechanism for integrating disadvantaged individuals into civic life. I disaggregate effects and examine whether civic returns to higher education are largest for disadvantaged low likelihood or advantaged high likelihood college goers. I find evidence for significant effect heterogeneity: civic returns to college are greatest among individuals who have a low likelihood for college completion. Returns decrease as the propensity for college increases."
0,"Stroke caregivers often do not have the information necessary to adequately manage the stroke recovery process at home. We explore how the educational needs of stroke caregivers vary by race, ethnicity, and place, and their association with caregiver characteristics. We surveyed 276 stroke caregivers living on the U.S. Mainland and in Puerto Rico to assess their educational needs related to stroke recovery. Caregivers report a high overall need for educational materials with Puerto Rican stroke caregivers having greater needs compared to whites and African Americans on the Mainland. Increased caregiver educational needs are associated with greater desire to institutionalize, less positive appraisals of care-giving, greater use of coping strategies, and greater burden. All caregivers can benefit from educational materials, but special attention to island-dwelling Puerto Rican caregivers may provide additional benefit. Future research and interventions should focus on tailoring educational materials for race, culture, and other caregiver characteristics."
0,"The last quarter of the twentieth century saw an erosion of job security in both manual and professional occupations. In this article, we investigate how the proliferation of employee involvement schemes in manual production and the growth of layoffs, temporary outsourcing, and project-based teams in the professions have influenced working conditions in both manual and professional settings. We argue that these practices represent not a departure from scientific management as is often presumed, but rather adoption of Taylorist principles not fully manifested in Fordist-era mass production. Flexible practices have thus expanded the influence of scientific management in manual work, and extended the scope of its application into the professions in an era perhaps more aptly termed neo-Taylorist than post-Fordist. Using data derived from the population of workplace ethnographies, we evaluate historical shifts in the organization of manual and professional work and outcomes for employees. Our findings support accounts critical of the nature and degree of change in manual jobs and suggest that post-Fordist shifts in the professions have successfully ushered in intensification analogous to what Fordist strategies accomplished in manual work-with unintended negative consequences for workers. Our conclusions point to a general deterioration of conditions in both manual and professional occupations due at least in part to an increasingly rigorous application of the principles of scientific management to both types of work."
0,"Wage inequality has increased dramatically in the United States since the 1980s. This article investigates the relationship between this trend and occupational structure measured at the three-digit level. Using the Current Population Survey from 1983 to 2002, we find that the direct association between occupations and wage inequality declined over this period as within-occupational inequality grew faster than between occupational inequality. We estimate multilevel growth models using detailed occupational categories as the unit of analysis to assess how the characteristics Of occupations affect changes in mean wages and levels of wage inequality across this time period. The results indicate that changes in mean wages across occupations vary depending on the characteristics of individuals in those occupations and that intraoccupational inequality is difficult to predict using conventional labor force data. These findings seem largely inconsistent with the common sociological view of occupation as the most fundamental feature of the labor market. Correspondingly, a more comprehensive approach-one that incorporates the effects of organizational variables and market proeesses on rising wage inequality in the New Economy-is warranted."
0,"While preference-based explanations play an increasing role in economics and sociology, the accurate measurement of social preferences deserves more attention. Most laboratory experiments measure social preferences by studying the division of ""a cake that nobody had to bake"" (Guth and Kliemt, 2003). This article reports results of the first ultimatum game experiment with bargaining over waiting time. The experiment was created to avoid effects of windfall gains. In contrast to donated money, time is not endowed by the experimenter and implies a natural loss to subjects. This allows for a better measurement of the inherent conflict in the ultimatum game. We implemented three anonymity conditions: one baseline condition, one condition with anonymity among subjects and one double-blind condition in which the experimenter did not know the division of waiting time. While we expected to observe less other-regarding behavior in ultimatum game bargaining over time, our experimental results rather confirm previous ultimatum game experiments, in which people bargained over money. The modal offer was half of the waiting time and only one offer was rejected. Interestingly, anonymity did not change the results significantly. In conclusion, our experiment confirms other-regarding behavior in the ultimatum game. "
0,"Tests of the racial threat hypothesis, linking the racial composition of place to various measures of social control, find that where there are greater percentages of blacks, more punitive criminal justice policies are implemented. Just as the criminal justice system continues to get tougher on crime despite stagnant crime rates, it is also clear that schools are becoming harsher toward student misbehavior and delinquency despite decreases in these school-based occurrences. However, only a very limited number of studies have been able to partially explain this trend of intensifying social control in schools. Using a national sample of 294 public schools, the present study is the first to test the racial threat hypothesis within schools to determine if tire racial composition of students predicts greater use of punitive controls, regardless of levels of misbehavior and delinquency. Results of multivariate analyses support the racial threat perspective, finding that schools with a larger percentage of black students are not only more likely to use punitive disciplinary responses, but also more likely to use extremely punitive discipline and to implement zero tolerance policies. They also use fewer mild disciplinary practices and restitutive techniques: In addition, racial threat is more influential when school delinquency and disorder are lower."
0,"This paper tests the utility of Donald Blacks theory in his seminal work The Behavior of Law.  According to Black, the use of law in any social context varies directly at different levels of stratification, morphology (integration), culture, organization, and social control.  Law will appear and will be used differently when changes take place along these five social dimensions.  All social contexts possess and can vary along these dimensions, and the use of law fluctuates when anyone of these five dimensions changes.  The purpose of this study is to test how law behaves in a clearly defined and bounded social context, namely, high schools.  Student-level (individual) and school-level (group) data from the NELS (2002) will be used to test how law behaves differently among schools when considereing the five social demensions proposed by Black."

0,"In this paper we take a longitudinal perspective to analyze gender differences in academic career attainment.  We improve upon prior research both theoretically and methodologically.  Theoretically, we introduce and conceptualize the influence of a heretofore-neglected factor in career attainment: the extent of research specialization.  We conceive of the extent of research specialization as a form of professional capital that improves two career outcomes of great import: productivity and visibility.  Specializing allows a scholar to gain in-depth knowledge of a body of literature and thus should make successive papers on that topic easier to write, thereby increasing productivity.  Specializing allows scholars to come to know, and be known by, other scholars in a specialty area, thereby improving visibility.  We expect that specialization, like other forms of capital, will have differential effects on mens and womens career processes.  Methodologically, we take a holistic perspective and examine scholars career trajectories to understand how advantage and disadvantage unfold over time.  In contrast to previous research on this topic, we specifically examine how mens and womens productivity and visibility unfold over time rather than examining discretized periods of scholars careers.  We find that specializing is most beneficial with regard to productivity  that is, it helps scholars publish more.  Specializations effects on visibility are less general: surprisingly, only womens visibility seems to benefit from specialization.  We discuss these findings, their implications, and suggest avenues for future research on this important newly recognized form of capital."

0,"Scholars are often pessimistic about adolescent dating, linking it to increases in depression, interpersonal violence, conflict with parents, school failure, associations with delinquents, substance use, and offending. Yet, the various dimensions of dating may offered have opposing consequences. The closeness offered by adolescent romantic love may fill an important void found between the weakening of bonds with parents and the onset of adult attachments, and it may discourage an array of negative outcomes, including involvement in crime. Adolescent sexual activity, in contrast, may increase offending, in part by augmenting the strain created by relationships. When coupled with a romantic relationship, however, sex is likely less stressful and consequential for crime. In this article, we analyze patterns of romance, sexual behavior, and adolescent crime with panel data from the nationally representative Adolescent Health Survey. Findings support our expectations regarding differential effects of romance and sex. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results.for understanding adolescent delinquency, social attachments, and development."
0,"Using a sample of continuously-married individuals (793 women and 847 men) and their spouses drawn from the first two waves of the NSFH, we examine change in individuals' attitudes about mothers' employment. We investigate hypotheses derived from three models of attitude change: the exposure model, the interest-based model, and the control model. We find support for hypotheses derived from ail three. Consistent with exposure hypotheses, the adoption of fundamentalist beliefs reduces egalitarianism, while spouses' egalitarianism and spouses' education are positively related to individuals' own egalitarianism. As predicted in both exposure and interest hypotheses, women's entry into employment is positively related to women's egalitarianism, while wives' occupational prestige is positively related to men's egalitarianism. Congruent with the interest model, the presence of a young child is positively associated with women's egalitarianism. Consistent with the exposure model, the number of children in the home reduces men's egalitarianism, and a traditional division of housework decreases women's egalitarianism. Finally, consistent with the gender ideology discrepancy hypothesis, derived from the control model, individuals whose background, work, and family life are inconsistent with their gender ideology at wave 1 shift their gender ideology at wave 2 in a direction that is more compatible with their background, work, and family life: egalitarians with traditional life patterns at wave I are more traditional in their gender ideology at wave 2, and traditionals with egalitarian life patterns at wave I are more egalitarian at wave 2. We discuss the implications of these patterns for larger scale change in gender ideology. "
0,"Feminist Standpoint Theory identifies knowledge as a social product developed from a specific social position. We apply this theory to explore the dominant standpoint informing the social organization of Western art via an institution we call art/criticism. We find that the assumptions, values, and analytic strategies informing mainstream art and art criticism express the standpoint of privileged men. As a test of our argument, we consider the case of an artist who is often hailed as a feminist artist and yet is one of the most successful woman artists today: Cindy Sherman. We find that while Sherman is working with some fertile possibilities for feminist analysis, her work ends up re-directing this potential into a disempowering play with images. We conclude that rather than countering our argument, the celebration of Sherman's work as feminist reveals the workings, as well as the limits, of the privileged male standpoint in art."
0,"Identity maintenance processes can affect performance when that performance is relevant to an important self-identity, including performance on standardized tests of mental ability. Affect control theory proposes that individuals' performances are motivated to maintain concordance between fundamental sentiments about identities and contextually driven transient meanings. An experimental test used the college major identity and randomly assigned participants to different instruction sets that made an aptitude test either relevant to their major or a contrasting major (All participants took the Raven advanced progressive matrices test.). Participants who took a test of mental ability that they expected would verify their identity scored two and a half points higher than did participants who took a test of mental ability expected to verify a contrasting identity. Results strongly support the fundamental validity of affect control theory's predictions about situational meaning maintenance [Heise, David R., 1979.

0,"Does the language we use exert control over us? I argue that the particular form of racetalk used by a sample of white college students limits their opportunities to get beyond traditional notions of race and formulate a new, antiracist form of discourse. In this paper I present instances in which respondents show potential for antiracism but then make other statements that contradict their earlier statements. In employing Ritzer’s concept of McDonaldization for the analysis, I present the “rules” of engaging in racetalk for this sample of Americans. This paper aims to break new ground by providing both theoretical and methodological contributions through a more holistic analysis of racetalk, and more specifically, to highlight the potential for antiracism and the difficulty in expressing such antiracist thoughts when discussing race matters for these Americans."
0,"How does neighborhood poverty affect the poor ability to access resources such as health care and job information? Most studies have focused on individuals or neighborhoods; we focus on organizations - specifically, whether organizations are less connected if located in poor neighborhoods. Our case study is childcare centers. We ask whether centers' organizational ties provide parents access to important resources, and whether neighborhood poverty affects this capacity. Based on qualitative fieldwork in 23 New York City centers, we develop hypotheses about this process. We test them on a representative sample of 293 centers. Findings uncover that centers provide important resource-access through their ties and that neighborhood poverty does not undermine this capacity. We suggest that organizational ties may help explain the inconsistent results Of the neighborhood effects literature."
0,"This article discusses how organizations can resist normative institutional pressures associated with the use of formally trained and credentialed professionals. This research draws on neoinstitutional theories of isomorphism and utilizes a framework of religious training developed by <link rid=""b25"">Finke and Dougherty (2002), which emphasizes both the social and religious capital gained during professionalization, to show that resistance to normative institutional pressures is possible. The data demonstrate that organizations which act to reformulate the role of religious professionals in a way which limits both the opportunities and ability of clergy to implement and maintain organizational routines and processes can successfully avoid normative institutional forces. This research draws on over 50 interviews and 100 hours of fieldwork with people in the Emerging Church, a religious movement that has arisen in the last 25 years as a response to increasing distrust of institutional authority. This study helps to close the gap between institutional studies of organizations and the sociology of religion by suggesting that some, currently overlooked, organizational activities can be more accurately understood as deliberate attempts to resist institutionalizing forces."
0,"This paper asks whether maternal employment has a lasting influence on the division of household labor for married women and men. Employing multi-level models with 2002 ISSP survey data for 31 countries, we test the lagged accommodation hypothesis that a long societal history of maternal employment contributes to more egalitarian household arrangements. Our results find that living in a country with a legacy of high maternal employment is positively associated with housework task-sharing, even controlling for the personal socialization experience of growing up with a mother who worked for pay. In formerly socialist countries, however, there is less gender parity in housework than predicted by the high historical level of maternal employment. "
0,"Does military service help or harm an individuals civilian employment opportunities?  Further, is this different whether one is black, white or Hispanic?  The purpose of this research is to assess the treatment of men who are recent military veterans in two large urban labor markets.  In this project I fax matched pairs or sets of resumes to advertised entry-level positions in each of the two labor markets.  Interest focuses on whether employers (the subjects) call back white, black, Hispanic and Arab-descent applicants at the same rate, and whether they call back veterans and non-veterans at the same rate.  The research design allows for a direct assessment of whether employers exhibit discriminatory or preferential hiring treatment of veterans, and whether this differs by race/ethnic background and labor market locale.  The experimental design used in the current research is a substantial improvement over statistical approaches used in earlier research by isolating the effects of the treatment condition (race or veteran status) rather than confounding it with other characteristics related to employment.  The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq raise the question of how recent veterans of the military are being treated by employers.  Because of the discriminatory treatment of many Vietnam veterans after their return from duty, it is important to make early assessments of how recent veterans of an all-volunteer force are being treated upon their return to the civilian workforce, after serving in wartime."
0,"In this article we take a longitudinal perspective to analyze gender differences in academic career attainment. We improve upon prior research both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, we incorporate the extent Of research specialization as a form of professional capital that potentially improves productivity and visibility, especially for men. Methodologically, we introduce a measure of research specialization and examine how men's and women's productivity and visibility unfold over time, rather than examining discrete periods of scholars' careers. We find that specializing is most beneficial with regard to productivity - that is, it helps scholars publish more. Specialization effects on visibility are less general: surprisingly, only women visibility seems to benefit from specialization. We discuss these findings and their implications, and suggest avenues for future research on this important and newly recognized form of capital."
0,"We examine relationships between childhood abuse and two maladaptive marital communication patterns - hostile and withdrawing - and test whether covenant marriage or pre-marital counseling mediate the effects of childhood abuse. Drawing on a sample from the Marriage Matters (1997-2004) data, we find both gendered differences in communication and in the relationship between childhood abuse and negative communication patterns. Wives are more likely to use a hostile style of communication, whereas husbands are more likely to use a withdrawing style. We also find that childhood abuse affects hostile communication for both spouses but influences only wives' withdrawing. Neither covenant marriage nor pre-marital counseling is associated with hostile communication for either spouse. Covenant marriage increases husbands' withdrawal from conflict, whereas pre-marital counseling increases the use of withdrawing communication in both wives and husbands. "
0,"In the last several years, there have been numbers of mass demonstrations against the institutions of global capital, specifically the WTO, G-8, World Bank, IMF etc.  Such movements and mobilizations have indeed been made possible by the ability of the Internet to allow a new communication medium that allows the emergence of virtual public spheres and the mobilization of Net Armies, internetworked social movements seeking alternatives to  the now hegemonic Neo-Liberal form embraced by Trans National Capital sustained by consumerism as its hegemonic ideology.  Such movements, in a short time, have already had major impact upon the world scene. As the most recent meeting of the World Economic Forum, the elites of TNC have indicated greater awareness of the dysfunctions and grievances of the current system. At the same time, the World Social Forum has now emerged as the major site for articulating critiques of the current system and formulating alternatives. The fundamental problematics for the future asks to what extent can TNC reform itself and yet sustain profits. At the same, can the alternative positions  of the WSF, find impact within TNC without compromising its stance."
0,"Against the backdrop of twentieth-century ideologies of scientific and intensive childrearing, this analysis examines the intersection of expert and lay advice on childrearing in a popular magazine, Parents.  Through qualitative content analysis of 300 articles, twentieth-century changes in parents authority and childrens autonomy are explored.  Children are increasingly depicted as needing autonomy in matters of developmental growth, yet their individual autonomy has become greatly constrained in other ways.  While children seem to have gained some kinds of autonomy in the private spaces of their homes, they have lost much of their public autonomy outside of private homes.  As adolescence becomes an ever-more extended phase of life, childrens dependence on parents is prolonged, and the adoption of meaningful responsibilities is delayed.  At the same time that childrens freedom of movement is severely curtailed and parents are assumed to exercise increased surveillance of their children, parents are paradoxically advised to allow their children opportunities for autonomous choice and decision-making.  However, given the dearth of opportunities for adolescents to exercise responsibilities that contribute meaningfully to their households and communities, parents are advised instead to shore up their childrens self-esteem through emotional support and displays of affection in order to provide the resilience that is necessary for success in a world characterized by flexible capitalism."
0,"Using a sample of 2,271 workers from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce whose employers offered personal health insurance, this article investigates the gendered nature of health insurance benefit take-ups. These analyses include family and employment characteristics in addition to employers' contributions to health insurance premiums, a measure that is unexamined in sociological analyses of health benefits. Progressive logistic regression models predict the effects of gender and family characteristics. Results indicate that women with employed spouses are less likely to take up their own health benefits than are comparable men, net of basic employment characteristics. Gender differences disappear, however, when controlling for the level of employer contributions: women and men are equally likely to draw on their own employer's health benefits once we account for their out-of-pocket expense. The authors conclude that family contexts and employment structures jointly influence individuals' choices about their health benefits. The gendered structure of employment and, specifically, gendered patterns in employer contributions to health benefits are a better explanation for women's lower chances of benefit take-ups than gender relations within families."
0,"A number of studies have shown that, as a result of the ambiguity of US legal mandates, organizations have considerable latitude in how they comply with regulations. In this paper, we address how the different agendas of the federal and state governments increase ambiguities in state-firm relations and how states are interested actors in creating opportunities for firms to navigate the federal legislation. We analyze the institutional forces behind bank acquisitions within and across state lines in order to illuminate the ways that US states take advantage of federal ambiguity and are able to shape corporate practices to their benefit. We specifically examine how patterns of bank acquisitions are shaped by the crucial relationship between the federal Community Reinvestment Act "
0,"This study outlines a new explanation for homophily in social networks that is neither intended nor imposed by constraints on partner choices. Rather, homophily is an endogenous product of the emergent exchange process, in which actors seek high-value partners who reciprocate their gestures. Whereas all actors initially direct exchange toward higher value partners, the gestures of lower value actors are more likely to go unreciprocated. This imbalance drives lower value actors to seek new partners, who end up being others who are also lower value. The consequence is homophily on value despite no such preference. I draw upon social exchange theory to articulate how this process unfolds in a newly forming network. A laboratory experiment tests hypotheses about how exchange patterns change over time. Findings reveal that shifts in participants' behavior over time were consistent with a concern for reciprocity, resulting in increasing levels of homophily in the network."
0,"There are sizeable earnings differentials by gender and race in the U.S. labor market, with women earning less than men and most racial/ethnic minority groups earning less than whites. It has been proposed in the previous literature that the effects of gender and race on earnings are additive, so that minority women suffer the full disadvantage of each status. We test this proposition for a broad range of minority groups in the United States. We find that women of all minority groups suffer a smaller gender penalty than white women (relative to same-race men). Exploring the potential role of racial variation in gender role specialization in producing such differentials, we find some empirical evidence suggesting that white families specialize more than families of most other races."
0,"Researchers consistently find that educational and familial settings unintentionally reproduce socioeconomic status via distinct socialization patterns in their community contexts. Yet there are surprisingly few studies examining this pattern as related to religious settings. This study extends the social reproduction literature by examining intended socialization of religious-based youth programs across socioeconomic status of the areas in which religious congregations are located. Data analyzed are from the Northern Indiana Congregation Study, a high response-rate phone survey with all religious congregations located within three contiguous cities, combined with Census data for the postal code of the congregation location, and in-person interviews with stratified-quota sampled religious youth leaders. This analysis provides evidence for a spatially stratified pattern to religious youth socialization. Findings reveal how deeply socioeconomic reproduction permeates social life, including even the youth socialization practices of religious congregations, and indicates that low-income youth may be particularly disadvantaged in the available religious socialization."
0,"The term ""second shift"" from Hochschild's (1989) classic volume is commonly used by scholars to mean that employed mothers face an unequal load of household labor and thus a ""double day"" of work. We use two representative samples of contemporary U.S. parents with preschoolers to test how mothers employed fulltime and married to a full-time worker (Focal mothers) differ in time allocations and pressures from fathers and from mothers employed parttime or not at all. Results indicate focal mothers' total workloads are greater than fathers' by a week-and-a-half, not an ""extra month"" per year. Focal mothers have less leisure, but do not experience more onerous types of unpaid work, nor get less sleep than fathers. Focal mothers feel greater time pressures compared with fathers; however, some of these tensions extend to other mothers of young children. Finally, these families may be engaged in fewer quality activities with children compared with families where mothers are not employed fulltime."
0,"Wheelchair basketball offers an ethnographic space through which I connect the lives of disabled athletes to a personal engagement with disability. I had been looking for role models, for people who might offer guidance to help my family cope with a disability. In this paper, written in the style of a personal essay, I recount the stories of three men whose perseverance in the face of adversity illustrates the dynamic interface between agency and structure and suggests a way to move beyond the ""supercrip"" critique that is prevalent in the disability studies literature. Their stories and others like theirs have emboldened me and helped me turn fate and contingency into a challenge rather than a calamity."
0,"One of the great paradoxes of inequality in organizations is that even when organizations introduce new programs designed to help employees in traditionally disadvantaged groups succeed, employees who use these programs often suffer negative career consequences. This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature by investigating how local employer practices can enable employees to successfully use the programs designed to benefit them. Using a research approach that controls for regulatory environment and program design, we analyze unique longitudinal personnel data from a large law firm to demonstrate that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes for individuals who later use a reduced-hours program. Additionally, we find that initial assignment to powerful supervisors is more important to positive career outcomes-that is, employee retention and performance-based pay-than are factors such as supervisor assignment at the time of program use. Initial assignment affects career outcomes for later program users through the mechanism of improved access to reputation-building work opportunities. These findings have implications for research on work-family programs and other employee-rights programs and for the role of social capital in careers."
0,"This study examines the stability of religious preference among people who claim no religious preference in national surveys (i.e., religious nones). Using a new panel dataset, we show that about 30% of the religious nones in the first wave of the survey claimed an affiliation with a religious group a year later in the second wave. However, the percentage of religious nones remained stable in the two waves because a similar number of respondents moved in the opposite direction. Using various measures of religiosity, we show that most of these unstable nones did not experience any significant change in religious belief or practice. We suggest that they can be characterized as liminal nones as they stand halfway in and halfway out of a certain religious identity. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on the controversies surrounding the rise of religious nones in recent years."
0,"Gaining access to and developing rapport with study participants can be difficult when conducting qualitative research.  The process of getting ones feet wet in the field (Geertz 1983; 1973) is an important and often crucial step in developing as a qualitative researcher.  Reflecting upon the data collection phase of a recent research endeavor, I have been able to better understand why some efforts in the field were more fruitful and/or more meaningful than others.  In this paper, I discuss the pleasantries and difficulties in gaining access to and developing rapport with women quilters in the United States, and the gendered assumptions I and other researchers make about the populations they study.  The local knowledge we seek to gain in conducting field research is influenced in part by the identities of the researcher, including gender."
0,"Previous studies of care work assume that caregivers find fulfillment through the emotional responsiveness of their clients.  This study examines emotional labor in a context where care workers cannot rely on the responsiveness of their clients as a direct reward for providing warmth and nurturance.  I propose that care workers use emotion as a resource in caregiving relationships, through which they find personal rewards independent of clients responses.  Based on nine months of field work in a nursing home, I analyze ethnographic data on caregiving for frail elderly residents who suffer from Alzheimers.  I find that care workers use emotional labor to create, negotiate, and redefine caregiving relationships, producing a sense of worth and control in their work.  Care workers perform four types of emotional labor that make care work meaningful and manageable: (1) creating attachments, (2) managing closeness, (3) mood work, and (4) respect work.  These practices are not institutionally enforced in this setting, but rather, are part of a work culture in which care workers participate to varying degrees.  My analysis confirms previous arguments about how emotion operates as a resource in work relationships and broadens our understanding of how caregivers make meaning of their work."
0,"Sociological analysis has mainly portrayed empowerment as a manipulative, masking discourse. However, various actors in society view it as the opposite of domination and espouse it as a goal. Empowerment can constitute a discursive field shaped by its internal contractions between autonomy and control, between ambition and risk of programmed failure, exacerbated by the emphasis on responsibility, and between focus and stigmatization. The paper presents a case study of controversies and interventions concerning employability in the Netherlands. Employability can be seen as empowerment in matters of career. The study is based on 41 interviews with policy makers, managers, union and employers’ leaders and politicians. It shows that actors drawing on the principle of empowerment as a goal in itself can reset or reclaim a drifting empowerment project in its inceptive phase and add their own twist during execution, evaluation and efforts to engineer improvements."
0,"Gender inequalities have received increased attention over the last century largely due to advances in international womens movements.  While research demonstrates that social, economic, political, and personal indicators at the individual level influence gender role attitudes, less attention has been paid to contextual-level variables. I examine cross-national differences in attitudes towards appropriate gender roles in the public sphere in 39 countries, all with diverse socio-economic, political, and religious backgrounds.  Using data from the World Values Survey and international country-level statistics I explore individual-level and contextual-level indicators of gender role attitudes outside of the home.  In particular, effects of welfare state effort on gender role attitudes are empirically tested.  Measures of the welfare state are found to have a significant, negative effect on the conservatism of gender role attitudes.  Increased government spending on social services, as well as policies that support womens entry into the paid labor force, create more egalitarian attitudes towards gender roles in the public sphere. Additionally, most of the contextual-level variables included in this analysis have a significant effect on attitudes towards gender roles outside of the home.  Therefore, I argue that individual-level effects alone cannot account for cross-national differences in attitudes towards gender roles in the public sphere."
0,"Institutional changes associated with the rise of shareholder value capitalism have had seemingly contradictory effects on managers and managerialism in the United States economy. Financial critiques of inefficient corporate bureaucracies and the resulting wave of downsizing, mergers, and computerization subjected managers to unprecedented layoffs during the 1980s and 1990s as firms sought to become lean and mean. Yet the proportion of managers and their average compensation continued to increase during this period. How did the rise of anti-managerial investor ideologies and strategies oriented toward reducing companies' labor costs coincide with increasing numbers of ever more highly paid managerial employees? This article examines the paradoxical relationship between shareholder value and managerialism by analyzing the effects of shareholder value strategies on the growth of managerial employment and managerial earnings in 59 major industries in the U.S. private sector from 1984 to 2001. Results from industry-level dynamic panel models show that layoffs, mergers, computerization, deunionization, and the increasing predominance of publicly traded firms all contributed to broad-based increases in the number of managerial positions and the valuation of managerial labor. Results are generally consistent with David Gordon's (1996) fat and mean thesis."
0,"Research has documented the stigma of obesity extensively, but little attention has been given to the study of stigma toward formerly obese individuals. The present study examines whether the stigma of obesity in romantic relationships carries over to formerly obese individuals by using primary data collected from a Midwestern university in the United States (N = 363). We consider how an individual's own body weight, demographic characteristics, familiarity, and attitudes affect the willingness to form a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person. Results suggest that obese individuals are less likely to hesitate about engaging in a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person than underweight or normal weight individuals, but only when attitudes toward obese and formerly obese individuals are controlled. In terms of demographic characteristics, men and African Americans are more likely to hesitate about forming a romantic relationship than their respective counterparts. More familiarity with currently obese family members and formerly obese close friends appears to reduce the stigma minimally. Greater social distance is also desired if weight loss is believed to be temporary."
0,"We summarize prior theories on the adaptation process of the contemporary immigrant second generation as a prelude to presenting additive and interactive models showing the impact of family variables, school contexts and academic outcomes on the process. For this purpose, we regress indicators of educational and occupational achievement in early adulthood on predictors measured three and six years earlier. The Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, used for the analysis, allows us to establish a clear temporal order among exogenous predictors and the two dependent variables. We also construct a Downward Assimilation Index, based on six indicators and regress it on the same set of predictors. Results confirm a pattern of segmented assimilation in the second generation, with a significant proportion of the sample experiencing downward assimilation. Predictors of the latter are the obverse of those of educational and occupational achievement. Significant interaction effects emerge between these predictors and early school contexts, defined by different class and racial compositions. Implications of these results for theory and policy are examined."

0,"This article presents the first evidence based on a newly-compiled database of known lynch victims. Using information from the original census enumerators' manuscripts, we identify individual- and household-level characteristics of more than 900 black males lynched in 10 southern states between 1882 and 1929. First, we use the information for successfully linked cases to present a profile of individual- and household-level characteristics of a large sample of lynch victims. Second, we compare these characteristics with a randomly-generated sample of black men living in the counties where lynchings occurred. We use our findings from this comparative analysis to assess the empirical support for alternative theoretical perspectives on the selection of individuals as victims of southern mob violence. Third, we consider whether the individual-level risk factors for being targeted as a lynch victim varied substantially over time or across space. Our results demonstrate that victims were generally less embedded within the social and economic fabric of their communities than were other black men. This suggests that social marginality increased the likelihood of being targeted for lynching. These findings are generally consistent across decades and within different sociodemographic contexts."
0,"Much of the sociological curriculum often represents society as tragedy. This article explores the incorporation of a society as comedy component in introductory courses at two institutions using the sociological insight and social critique of comedians. A general discussion of parallels between the comedic eye and the sociological imagination is followed by specific steps for locating, selecting and incorporating comedic clips into various courses. Using comparisons between experimental and control groups, as well as student questionnaires, we found that using comedians to model sociological perspectives increased student ability to apply course concepts, decreased student anxiety when tackling new concepts, and engaged a broader number of students during class discussion. We conclude with discussion of challenges specific to these methods  language use and controversial comedians  as well as the broader need to learn from figures who have been historically successful at engaging the public on issues of social importance."
0,"Dependency scholars emphasize the harmful effects of economic incorporation for nations residing in the periphery. Conversely, a network perspective of international relations suggests that the major problem peripheral countries face is isolation. Considered together, peripherality implies both resource and partner dependency. Applying dependency and network principles to the world economy and world polity, the author assembles a set of cross-national measures based on international trade relations and membership in international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). Analyzing a sample of eighty-two developing countries during the 1980-2000 period, the author tests the effects of dependency and network integration on two measures of development: economic growth and tertiary school expansion. The author finds that dependent integration in trade and INGOs produces economic underdevelopment, while network integration in trade and INGOs positively affects economic growth and educational expansion. The findings broadly confirm dependency and network perspectives, demonstrating the developmental benefits that accrue to core/central actors relative to more dependent/peripheral economies."
0,"Research into the effects of neighborhood characteristics on children s behavior has burgeoned in recent years but these studies have generally adopted a limited conceptualization of the spatial and temporal dimensions of neighborhood effects We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and techniques of spatial data analysis to examine how both the socioeconomic characteristics of extralocal neighborhoods-neighborhoods surrounding the immediate neighborhood of residence and the duration of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout the childhood life course influence the likelihood of graduating from high school Among blacks and whites, socioeconomic advantage in the immediate neighborhood Increases the likelihood of completing high school but among whites higher levels of socioeconomic advantage in extralocal neighborhoods decrease high school graduation rates Extralocal neighborhood advantage suppresses the influence of advantage in the immediate neighborhood so that controlling for extralocal conditions provides stronger support for the neighborhood effects hypothesis than has previously been observed Exposure to advantaged neighborhoods over the childhood life course exerts a stronger effect than point-in-time measures on high school graduation, and racial differences in exposure to advantaged neighbors over the childhood life course help to suppress a net black advantage in the likelihood of completing high school "
0,"Existing demgoraphic theories fail to provide an all-encompassing explanations of rich variations in fertility across time, countries and regions. The purpose of the paper is to examine ways of possible advancing of these theories by exploring their sociological roots, to look for possibilities of hteir possible integration, to specify scope conditions in which each of the theory's premises work and to outline the avenues for possible research to specify the theoretical refining. The paper specifically address the issue of reseraching short-term fluctuations in fertility including the ones related to social instability. In regard to this goal the possibility of applying middle-range sociological theory of uncertainty reduction is explored."
0,"The Texas legislature passed the Top 10% Law in 1996 guaranteeing automatic admission to any Texas public college or university for seniors who graduate in the top decile of their high school class. Using data on a representative sample of seniors (N = 12,029) enrolled in 96 Texas public high schools, we examine whether and how this law affects the educational aspirations and expectations of graduating seniors, as well as whether they apply to college. Hierarchical generalized linear models demonstrate that the knowledge of a percent plan has played an important role in raising the sights of students who might not otherwise consider college. This effect is particularly pronounced for minority students, although peer, family and high school context play pivotal roles."

0,"The Global Digital Divide (GDD) in Internet and related forms of information technologies has gained some press and scholarly attention in recent years. Although the contours and causes of Internet diffusion around the globe are now better understood, a number of questions and avenues remain unanswered or unexplored, particularly concerning the role of socio-demographic structures and even conflict processes on Internet diffusion. This study addresses the current state of the digital divide and sheds new light on the barriers that continue to inhibit developing nations' lag with the West in Internet connectivity. Focusing on a large sample of the world's developing nations, this project finds that although the GDD is narrowing, the gap is still large and that specific demographic properties (high fertility) and conflict processes threaten to keep many societies in the periphery of cyberspace. The authors also find that urban agglomerations work to amplify Internet demand over time and that maturing economies may no longer require democratization as a pathway to Internet development. Implications of these findings and future directions of research are briefly discussed."
0,"Racial segregation in schools and neighborhoods in the United States is stark and persistent. The results of this research provide clues as to why it may be so enduring. We find that as predominantly white schools in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area experience increases in black representation of up to seven percentage points during a four- to five-year period, white neighborhood residents are more likely to perceive that the quality of their schools has declined, despite the current conditions of the schools and in spite of changes in school characteristics. Our results are more consistent with racial threat theory than contact theory because they suggest that white residents may initially be threatened by racial change and judge declining school quality according to the racial change itself As a consequence, white families may flee these integrating schools and neighborhoods, further contributing to school and neighborhood segregation."
0,"Parents? citizenship appears to partially eclipse children?s citizenship in the U.S. Within families with native born parents and internationally adopted children, there is a full eclipse: legally, the children are accepted as full members of U.S. society, as though they were native born themselves. In mixed status immigrant families (with citizen children and immigrant parents), the degree of eclipsing may vary, depending in part upon whether parents are in the U.S. legally or if they are undocumented. Formally, all citizen children are equal. Informally, recent welfare and immigration legislation has created two classes of citizen children in the U.S.: one class lives in households with noncitizens and has restricted access to social benefits, while the second class of citizen children lives in households with only citizens and suffers no comparable disadvantage. In ideal terms, membership in the nation-state is supposed to be egalitarian, and citizens should be entitled to uniform rights and privileges, but these ideals do not seem to apply to children in the U.S. at present. This paper examines these developments and questions the equality and independency of childhood citizenship in the U.S."
0,"The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) housing experiment has proven to be an important intervention not just in the lives of the poor, but in social science theories of neighborhood effects. Competing causal claims have been the subject of considerable disagreement, culminating in the debate between Clampet-Lundquist and Massey and Ludwig et al. in this issue. This article assesses the debate by clarifying analytically distinct questions posed by neighborhood-level theories, reconceptualizing selection bias as a fundamental social process worthy of study in its own right rather than a statistical nuisance, and reconsidering the scientific method of experimentation, and hence causality, in the social world of the city. The author also analyzes MTO and independent survey data from Chicago to examine trajectories of residential attainment. Although MTO provides crucial leverage for estimating neighborhood effects on individuals, as proponents rightly claim, this study demonstrates the implications imposed by a stratified urban structure and how MTO simultaneously provides a new window on the social reproduction of concentrated inequality."
0,"This article examines the ways Australian Pagans use e-mail discussion lists as a means of fostering community among dispersed offline practitioners. Sociologists struggle with ways of characterizing the Pagan movement. It appears to lack the necessary set of uniform beliefs and organizational features that reference community relations in other religions. However, new information and communication technologies (ICTs) accompanying globalization are changing the forms of human association and have stimulated speculation regarding the extent to which they foster community. Existing conceptualizations of community suffer from the historical emergence of the virtual/real distinction and are inadequate to characterizing sociability in the networked society. Wenger's theory of a community of practice (1998) is suggested as a way through this dilemma. The community of practice model is used to examine how Pagans integrate online and offline communications. Pagan social practices illustrate the ways in which individuals negotiate personal meanings and a sense of community in postmodern times."
0,"This paper examines the stereotypes that have been associated with the abilities of football players of different races.  This practice often leads to ""stacking"", which Coakley (1998) defines as ""players from a certain racial or ethnic group being either over- or under-represented at certain positions in team sports"".  Traditionally, this has meant that African Americans were less likely to be found in ""thinking"" positions in football, most notably at quarterback, offensive center, and inside linebacker.  The author attempts to discern whether these stereotypes still exist in the minds of those most intimately involved with the issue: college and professional scouts.  The paper explores these issues by using a content analysis of National Football League (NFL) draft periodicals published by a popular sports magazine in the United States.  The results of the analysis show that scouts are significantly more likely to describe African American players in terms of their physical/athletic capabilities, and white players in terms of their mental/intelligence abilities."
0,"Few would argue that race, gender, and class are unrelated, now that scholars of inequality have spent decades making the once devalued but now widely accepted case that structures of oppression like these cannot be understood in isolation from each other.  Yet the imagery on which these scholars have reliedrace, gender, and class as intersecting or interlockinghas limited our ability to fully reveal the characteristics of the relationships among structures of oppression like these in empirical and theoretical work.  In this paper I build on the empirical work of Leslie Salzinger to reveal how race, gender, and class are produced, prepared, experienced, and digested in our human and institutional bodies.  This metaphor moves us away from imagery that unwittingly makes race, gender, and class seem static, and highlights instead the structural and individual forces at work in their constant and continual mutual constitution."
0,"We use data from the Voting and Registration Supplement Of the Current Population Survey to explore the effects of family structure on turnout in the 2000 presidential election. Our results indicate that family structure, defined as marital status and the presence of children, has substantial consequences for turnout. Married adults are more likely to vote than are those who have never been married, in turn, previously married people are the lightest voters. Children have a smaller but still noteworthy effect on turnout. These results are only partially explained by social and demographic differences."
0,"This study shows that the organization of work, particularly the structure of jobs, can sustain or erode gender and racial disadvantage. Restructuring work around team work and weaker job boundaries can improve women's and minorities' visibility and reduce stereotyping and thus should reduce their career disadvantage. Proponents of bureaucratic formalization argue, in contrast, that relaxing formal job definitions and emphasizing social relations at work will deepen ascriptive disadvantage. The reorganization of work in corporate America over the last two decades provides a test case. Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregation leads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. This study finds that when employers adopt popular team and training programs that increase cross-functional collaboration, ascriptive inequality declines. Similar programs that do not transcend job boundaries do not lead to such increases. The results point to different effects at the intersection of gender and race."
0,"The rise in singlehood among young adults is often seen as an indication that young adults are nowadays more individualized, suggesting that singlehood is viewed as a positive experience. Using the Panel Study of Social Integration in the Netherlands, we examined singles' (N = 836) relational attitudes across young adulthood. Singles were not very positive about singlehood and a large majority felt more positive about a partner relationship than about being alone. Most singles were also more positive about living together than about steady dating and cohabitation was more popular than marriage. We furthermore examined whether values, life-course experiences and ageing influence singles' relational attitudes. Value orientations and age proved to be the most consistent predictors. Singles with liberal values and older singles had less positive attitudes toward relational commitment than less liberal and younger singles. The findings suggest that the positive image of singlehood needs to be reconsidered. "
0,"It is widely argued that globalization and economic development are associated with international migration. However, these relationships have not been tested empirically. We use a cross-national empirical analysis to assess the impact of global and national factors on international migration from less-developed countries. An interdisciplinary analytical framework is developed. We then use several modeling techniques to analyze panel data on a set of less-developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Three central findings emerge from these analyses. First, foreign direct investment has a significant, differential effect across sectors of the economy: FDI in the primary sector increases the level of net emigration, while FDI in the secondary sector has a deterrent effect. Second, economic development has a significant, nonlinear effect on net emigration levels, the so-called ""migration hump."" Finally, we find a strong cumulative causation effect of migration, meaning that migration has a strong internal momentum after it has been initiated. The implications of the findings are discussed in the context of contemporary migration theory."
0,"In this paper we introduce a new way to conceptualize and measure the educational resources that young people encounter as they make their way from kindergarten to high school graduation. Using recent methodological advances in group-based modeling and a unique data set, we empirically test for and identify a series of categorically distinct school characteristic trajectories. We find that these trajectories vary significantly in terms of their intercept and slope, their prevalence within the sampled population, and in the sociodemographic makeup of their constituent members. We then present an extended empirical example illustrating relationships between school characteristic trajectories and important post-secondary educational outcomes, both before and after controlling for static, single-year measures of primary and secondary school characteristics. Our results suggest that the chronology of students' exposures to different educational resources is significantly associated with college enrollment, college selectivity, and, in some instances, college completion.

0,"The sociology of knowledge, derived from research on the hard sciences, overlooks the potential for outsiders to determine the content of knowledge within professional disciplines. Using the case of the Sally Hemings affair, I introduce the concept of ""knowledge advocacy"" to analyze how outside groups shape historical knowledge. The Hemings controversy involved not only historical evidence, but also the understanding of objectivity in historical research. Unfolding against the backdrop of the professionalization of history, outside advocates successfully challenged the disciplined understanding of ""objectivity as neutrality"" eventually embracing ""objectivity as the scientific method"" in their appeal to DNA testing. This study illuminates the strategic interplay between professional historians and outsiders engaged in knowledge advocacy, the role of objectivity in this struggle, and the potential vulnerability a discipline faces when the ideal of objectivity is compromised."
0,"This research used geocoded data from 11 waves (2000-2010) of the German Socioeconomic Panel Study to investigate the spatial distances of young adults initial move-outs (N = 2113) from their parents' homes. Linear regression models predicted moving distances by factors at individual, family, household, and community level. Overall, home leavers moved across very small distances with a median value of less than 10 km. Greater distances were found for well-educated and childless home leavers who moved out at relatively young ages from high-income households located in less-urbanized regions. In line with developmental models of migration, young adults stayed closer if the parental household was still located at their place of childhood. We conclude that considering the spatial distance of move-outs may advance our understanding of individual passages to adulthood and intergenerational relations across the life course. "
0,"This study explores womens and/or people of colors possible segregation within television sports broadcasting.  I use logistic regression to analyze a dataset of 356 sportscasters from national and cable networks to determine if sex and race affect the likelihood that sportscasters work in seven specific broadcasting jobsanchor, reporter, host, play-by-play announcer, game analyst, studio analyst, and competition-level reporter.  The results show that women are more likely than men to be reporters and competition-level reporters, while people of color have a greater likelihood of being a competition-level reporter than white sportscasters, even after adjusting for the effects of education, age, years since their first television broadcast, and if they cover at least one of the major sports of baseball, basketball, football, or hockey.  Sex and race do not appear to affect the likelihood of being an anchor or host.  For play-by-play announcers and game analysts, the effect of sex disappears after I adjust for the effects of the control variables.  I discuss how these findings relate to job-level sex and racial segregation, and suggest that the social closure perspective offers the most useful interpretation of these results."
0,"Why did the nation-state proliferate across the world over the past 200 years, replacing empires, kingdoms, city-states, and the like? Using a new dataset with information on 145 of today's states from 1816 to the year they achieved nation-statehood, we test key aspects of modernization, world polity, and historical institutionalist theories. Event history analysis shows that a nation-state is more likely to emerge when a power shift allows nationalists to overthrow or absorb the established regime. Diffusion of the nation-state within an empire or among neighbors also tilts the balance of power in favor of nationalists. We find no evidence for the effects of industrialization, the advent of mass literacy, or increasingly direct rule, which are associated with the modernization theories of Gellner, Anderson, Tilly, and Hechter. Nor is the growing global hegemony of the nation-state model a good predictor of individual instances of nation-state formation, as Meyer's world polity theory would suggest. We conclude that the global rise of the nation-state is driven by proximate and contextual political factors situated at the local and regional levels, in line with historical institutionalist arguments, rather than by domestic or global structural forces that operate over the long duree."
0,"Employee turnover is of broad interest, and we focus on turnover in an occupational group that is appropriate for our theoretical approach: nursing home staff. Using a large and representative sample, we apply conceptual work in the area of social exchange by Lawler and colleagues to examine the role of affect toward the organization on employee turnover as well as antecedents of that affect. We use previous research and survey data to demonstrate that nursing home staff work in the conditions under which Lawler's theories of social exchange apply. We use longitudinal survey data to test whether nursing home staff turnover can be predicted by the level of affective attachment of the individual staff members to the nursing home, controlling for factors related to nursing home turnover. We find that lower nursing home staff turnover at Time 2 is predicted by affective attachment to the nursing home at Time 1."
0,"Many studies have explored how social capital influences the academic experiences of secondary school students. A distinct literature has demonstrated the beneficial effects of social contacts on occupational attainment and the job search process. However, few studies have explored the effects of social capital at the postsecondary level. This study bridges this gap in the literature by examining the effects of campus social networks on college academic achievement and postgraduation education and occupation plans, using detailed panel data from an elite, private university. Results indicate that campus social networks have little effect on early college outcomes, although students with extensive networks are more likely to graduate with honors and continue on to graduate school. Students with extensive campus networks and extracurricular memberships are more likely to aspire to high-status professional occupations, especially as medical doctors, while family or personal networks are more important for aspiring lawyers."
0,"Internet provides a number of services and tons of information facilitating peoples lives. Online dating services become popular and the study of online relationship attracts many scientists focus. Using Pew Internet public data, I examined peoples attitudes towards online dating based on demographic and social-liberal characteristics. The research assessed the variances of peoples online dating attitudes based on demographic, relationship status, internet usage, social liberty, peoples trust towards others, and trust toward information online. Logistic regression was employed to build a model to gain an insight into such issues. The results indicates that gender, education, locale, age, Internet usage frequency and Internet activities, general trust towards others, and trust towards information online serves as significant indicators to predict peoples attitude toward online dating."
0,"This article examines the process of post-disaster recovery and rebuilding in New York City since 9/11 and in New Orleans since the Hurricane Katrina disaster (8/29). As destabilizing events, 9/11 and 8/29 forced a rethinking of the major categories, concepts and theories that long dominated disaster research. We analyze the form, trajectory and problems of reconstruction in the two cities with special emphasis on the implementation Of the Community Development Block Grant program, the Liberty Zone and the Gulf Opportunity Zone, and tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance and promote reinvestment. Drawing on a variety of data sources, we show that New York and New Orleans have become important laboratories for entrepreneurial city and state governments seeking to use post-disaster rebuilding as an opportunity to push through far-reaching neoliberal policy reforms. The emphasis on using market-centered approaches for urban recovery and rebuilding in New York and New Orleans should be seen not as coherent or sustainable responses to urban disaster but rather as deeply contradictory restructuring strategies that are intensifying the problems they seek to remedy."
0,"""Where most previous research on popular mobilization has sought to understand its sources or causes, the following study redirects attention to its effects on participants by focusing on collective action as a source of group identity and solidarity.  Specifically, how do patterned experiences of collective action lead to distinct understandings and practices of solidarity?  To answer this question we compare two cases of class-based collective action: a circumscribed workplace job action at a small auto parts manufacturer, and a heterogeneous community-based campaign to secure a living wage.  Drawing on in-depth interviews, participant observation, and archival materials, we demonstrate that participating in collective action strengthened solidarity in both cases but that, contrary to reigning theory, the greater diversity of the living wage campaign engendered a more expansive understanding of solidarity as compared to the more homogeneous and strategically powerful strikers.  The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in relationship to research on social movement and class formation."""
0,"Sociologists empirically and theoretically neglect genocide. In this article, our critical collective framing perspective begins by focusing on state origins of race-based ideology in the mobilization and dehumanization leading to genocide. We elaborate this transformative dynamic by identifying racially driven macro-micro-macro-level processes that are theoretically underdeveloped and contested in many settings. We investigate generic processes by exploiting an unprecedented survey of refugees from the ongoing genocide in Darfur Our focus is on the Sudanese government crisis framing of a dehumanizing collective process. Sudanese forces joined with Janjaweed militia to attack black African settlements. They aggregated and concentrated racial epithets in a collective process of dehumanization anti organized terror which amplified the severity of genocidal victimization, the lethal and lasting scar of the genocidal state. Our findings question primordial and counter-insurgency explanations, while supporting aspects of the instrumental, population-resource, constructionist, and cognitive perspectives that form the foundation of our critical collective framing perspective. It has been more than 50 years since Sutherland famously added white-collar crime to public sociology, radically reordering discourse about crime. It is time to do the same with Raphael Lemkin concept of genocide."
0,"This paper contributes to the growing body of research on participatory democracy and the literature on associational democracy by exploring the impact that institutional reforms have on local-level configurations of civil society. In the 1980s a wide range of participatory experiments were initiated in Brazil, most notably Participatory Budgeting in municipal governance. Municipios that adopted PB in principle devolve much or all of the decision making on new investments to decentralized participatory forums. In this paper we consider the results Of an eight-city matched-pair analysis conducted in 2004, in which we selected municipios that adopted PB in 1997-2000, and matched them with a similar municipio that did not in the same period, drawing from the full sample of municipios over 20,000 inhabitants. Building on relational theories of civil society, we show that PB has clear but limited effects on civil society. It moves civil society practices from clientelism to associationalism, but does not contribute to the capacity of civil society to self-organize, at least in the time-frame considered. We also show that this democratizing effect on civil society practices and networks is conditioned by pre-existing state-civil society relations."
0,"Research on racial-ethnic portrayals in television crime news is limited and questions remain about the sources of representations and how these vary for perpetrators versus victims. We draw from power structure, market share, normal crimes, racial threat, and racial privileging perspectives to further this research. The reported race or ethnicity of violent crime perpetrators and victims are modeled as functions of: (1) situational characteristics of crime stories and (2) contextual characteristics of television market areas. The primary data are from a stratified random sample of television newscasts in 2002-2003 (Long et al. 2005). An important innovation of our work is the use of a national, more generalizeable, sample of local news stories than prior researchers who tended to focus on single market areas. Results indicate that both the context of the story itself and the social structural context within which news stories are reported are relevant to ethnic and racial portrayals in crime news. We find limited support for power structure, market share, normal crimes, and racial threat explanations of patterns of reporting. Racial privileging arguments receive more extensive support."
0,"We investigate the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents through a comparison of the size and composition of the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents with single-race adolescents. We consider three hypotheses suggested by the literature on multiraciality and interracial friendships: (1) that multiracial adolescents have smaller friendship networks than single-race adolescents because they are more often rejected by their single-race peers, (2) that multiracial adolescents form more racially diverse friendship networks than single-race adolescents, and (3) that multiracial adolescents are especially likely to bridge (or socially connect) friendships among members of their single-race heritage background groups. Using data on adolescent friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we find that multiracial adolescents are as popular as non-white adolescents and have social networks that are as racially diverse as the single-race groups with the most diverse friendship networks. Biracial adolescents with black ancestry have an especially high rate of friendship bridging between black persons and persons of other races, relative to black or white adolescents. The results hold using both self-identified and parental race definitions. "
0,"Using data from a 2005 survey of U.S. workers, we find that a high percentage of employed men and women report that work interferes with nonwork life. This research offers three main contributions: (1) we document the social distribution of work-nonwork interference across social statuses and dimensions of stratification; (2) we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the influence of a comprehensive set of work resources and demands on interference and their contributions to its social distribution; and (3) we advance a ""stress of higher status"" perspective to understand the paradoxical influence of some work conditions on work-nonwork interference. Findings generally support both the demands hypothesis and the stress of higher status hypothesis, with patterns from both factors contributing substantially to the social distribution of work-nonwork interference. This article refines and elaborates the job demands-resources model with insights from border theory."
0,"This exposition analyzes lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer subculture(s) in terms of the reproduction of gendered hierarchies and stratification that mirrors the dominant, heteronormative Western culture. It is found in literature pertaining to identitiy politics and the body politic which LGBTQ subcultures utilize in attempts to resist dominant culture, hierarchies that reproduce and cater to heteronormatives are found pervasive. Utilizing the theories of Pierre Bourdieu, reproduction of gendered stratification is found in habitus and fields through cultural restraints, practices as a means of capital, ownership of LGBTQ identities as specialization, and the marketing of the Queer as a rational, money-making means."
0,"School systems in the U.S. are increasingly integrating computers into the classroom. Yet, we know little about the factors that determine successful adoption, use, and attitudes towards the computers. Birmingham, Alabama has been the first school system in the U.S. to distribute XO laptops (developed by the One Laptop Per Child – OLPC – organization) to all students in 1st-5th grades. The purpose of this study is to present survey results examining the range of factors that are related to XO laptop usage and attitudes towards these computers among 4th and 5th grade students in Birmingham City schools. Results indicate that factors vary depending upon the type of use or attitudes being examined. Teacher use of the XO laptop in the classroom is a primary factor that is related to frequency of XO application use and students’ attitudes toward the XOs. However, teacher ability is related to the hours of XO usage in school. These results suggest the importance of having well-trained and versed teachers who embrace the XO laptops in the classrooms in order to facilitate positive attitudes towards and use among students."
0,"The rise of knowledge societies that are increasingly constituted by knowledge settings creates a challenge to understand the relationship between how experts arrive at shared knowledge and the impact of this knowledge on broader society. Sociologists of science and technology have posited distinctive forms of cultural analysis by theorizing scientific domains as cultures or subcultures unto themselves to shed light on “knowledge practices.” This article extends the concept of “epistemic cultures” as a middle-range theory to the areas of policy and social movements to examine mechanisms of knowledge production in the field of critical heterosexuality studies. In particular, it analyzes the epistemic culture of marriage promotion, a movement that involves an array of knowledge-makers, including academics, professionals, and other activists. Studying epistemic cultures in the areas of policy and social change offers focus on the productive and relational aspects of knowledge, on how social and historical context shapes scientific and non-scientific knowledge claims, and on the mechanisms of knowledge production. In the case of the epistemic culture of marriage promotion, this article maps out the interaction of knowledges derived from (1) family and policy “experts” who champion the importance of heterosexual marriage, and (2) moral, religious, and commonsense knowledge about the history and state of the American nuclear family. Directions for future research are proposed."
0,"We attempt to explain what appears to be a contingent presence of educational triage by developing and testing a theory of the conditions under which high-stakes accountability is likely to result in practitioners gaming assessments.  Guided by the schools-as-organizations literature, we argue that under most conditions high-stakes accountability systems will impact instruction in some way, but that educators will only engage in educational triage when they are compelled and able to engage in data-driven decision making (DDDM) in deep and specific ways.  Furthermore, we contend that the likelihood of educators practicing DDDM in reaction to high-stakes accountability is contingent on the political and organizational context in which the reform is implemented.  To test our ideas, we explore the impact of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in Baltimore public schools, utilizing longitudinal student-level data for four cohorts of students who passed through the elementary grades at different moments in the history of Baltimore’s accountability reforms.  Our findings suggest that, as we compare achievement trajectories across the four cohorts, the likelihood of students scoring proficient or advanced on a high-stakes state assessment two years and four years after first grade has markedly improved since the implementation of the NCLB frameworks in 2003.  Additionally, our findings offer support for our theoretically driven hypothesis that while Baltimore educators did alter their classroom practices in response to NCLB, they did not engage in educational triage practices."
0,"We take a semiotic approach to studying religion in order to assess how basic English conveys the structure of the institution of religion and provides the lay public with knowledge about religious identities. Our data consist of definitions of religious identities provided by two dictionaries. The identities we consider are from Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and other religions. From the dictionary definitions, we created a semantic network showing how the meaning of one identity is elucidated by references to other identities. The network can be interpreted as roughly mapping the institutional layout of religion. Identities in the network partition into clusters corresponding to the major faiths, and status hierarchies of some institutional structures like abbeys are evident within faiths. A few bridging identities link different faiths, so the overall structure is loosely connected apart from a few semantic isolates. Our results suggest that basic English biases its speakers' awareness overwhelmingly toward Christian identities, provides meager knowledge regarding Judaism, and offers limited and sometimes eccentric views of other major faiths."
0,"Though many studies have suggested that social and behavioral skills play a central role in gender stratification processes, we know little about the extent to which these skills affect gender gaps in academic achievement. Analyzing data from the Early Child Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, we demonstrate that social and behavioral skills have substantively important effects on academic outcomes from kindergarten through fifth grade. Gender differences in the acquisition of these skills, moreover, explain a considerable fraction of the gender gap in academic outcomes during early elementary school. Boys get roughly the same academic return to social and behavioral skills as their female peers, but girls begin school with more advanced social and behavioral skills and their skill advantage grows over time. While part of the effect may reflect an evaluation process that rewards students who better conform to school norms, our results imply that the acquisition of social and behavioral skills enhances learning as well. Our results call for a reconsideration of the family and school-level processes that produce gender gaps in social and behavioral skills and the advantages they confer for academic and later success.

0,"According to behavioral genetics research, the intergenerational correlation in weight derives solely from shared genetic predispositions, but complete genetic determinism contradicts the scientific consensus that social and behavioral change underlies the modern obesity epidemic. To address this conundrum, this article utilizes sibling data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and extends structural equation sibling models to incorporate siblings' genetic relationships in order to explore the role of families' social characteristics for adolescent weight. The article is the first to demonstrate that the association between parents' obesity and adolescent weight is both social and genetic. Furthermore, by incorporating genetic information, the shared and social origins of the correlation between inactivity and weight are better revealed."
0,"Hurricane Katrina was not the first disaster to expose companion animals and their guardians to significant risk, nor was the first time that organizations were involved in the recovery of animals left by people who evacuated. Yet, Hurricane Katrina did give significant media exposure to the plight of pets and other non-human animal during disaster events. The purpose of this paper is to 1) explore preexisting characteristics of disaster vulnerability people who lose pets are more likely to have, and 2) examine pet loss in association with evacuation behaviors and other traumatic experiences during a disaster. The survey data are from 1510 Hurricane Katrina survivors conducted by the Gallup Organization in September and October 2005. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analysis were conducted. Based on the analysis, women, older adults, and people who evacuated were more likely to have lost a pet during hurricane Katrina. Additionally, people who lost pets were statistically different from their counterparts who did not loose a pet in terms of experiencing other traumatic events, including going without food or water, being separated from family, and being hurt or injured. The results of this study support the calls for greater attention to the human-animal bond during disasters and especially during evacuations."
0,"This article uses prospective data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 to investigate how children in divorced and never-married-mother families vary in reading and math achievement after parental remarriage. These are compared to children who remain in never-married, divorced, and continuously married families. Results based on growth curve modeling indicate that children remaining in single-parent families resulting from divorce or nonmarital births have lower achievement scores than children from married families. Maternal education and income account for all of the adverse effects of family structure on reading achievement, while maternal education, income, and children's home environment can explain the negative relationship between single parenting and math scores. We conclude that parental remarriage may have more benefits for children than previous studies have suggested."
0,"Understanding conditions that encourage or discourage diversity among organizations in any sector is an issue of great theoretical and practical significance.  Surprisingly, little research has investigated either the degree of diversity in a set of organizations at any time or changes in organizational diversity over time.  Our paper fills this gap.  We use one core attribute -- production technology -- to determine organizational forms.  We focus on newly founded organizations because variation at founding has a direct impact on the composition of any sector.  We are particularly interested in newly formed niches because in such settings, organizational variation is likely to have long-lasting effects.  We develop hypotheses concerning the impact of regulative, normative, and cognitive environmental features on the diversity of newly-founded firms, and test them using data on the independent power industry in the United States, examining variation among small-power producers and industrial cogenerators founded into a niche created by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.  Our results show that greater regulative support and cognitive legitimacy for this niche increased founding heterogeneity, while the creation of normative institutions in the niche decreased founding heterogeneity."
0,"This study examined whether the transition into adolescence, proxied by pubertal timing, shaped the transition into adulthood, proxied by union formation behaviors, among contemporary American women. In a sample drawn from Add Health (n = 7,523), early maturing girls reported an accelerated transition to marriage and cohabitation in young adulthood, net of family structure history, academic achievement in high school, and parental education. The link between pubertal timing and cohabitation was strongest among socioeconomically advantaged women; no socio-economic differences were identified for marriage. The tendency for early maturers to have more pronounced romantic orientations during adolescence partially explained their transitions to marriage. In all, the persistence of the pubertal timing effect into young adulthood suggests that early maturers accelerated entrance into the romantic market in adolescence has a cascading, long-term impact on the shape of their lives in young adulthood."
0,"The collective action repertoires that postcommunist states inherited from Leninist states for the most part discourage popular participation in politics, constrain protest mobilization and channel not only political activism but civic engagement into noncontentious forms (Johnston 2006; Johnston and Mueller 2001; Kennedy 1992; Pfaff and Yang 2001; Straughn 2005).  This means that within countries making a transition from state socialism, contentious collective action is rarely a viable option for expressing disapproval of state actions. Yet a surprising wave of protest activity challenging authoritarian states and referred to as the Colored Revolutions has swept in recent years across several postcommunist states. This paper is devoted to understanding the role local culture played in generating one of these unexpected episodes of mass contention: the Orange Revolution.  It builds on ethnographic work and interviews I conducted in 2001, 2004 and 2005, among women who participated in the cycle of protests in Ukraine that culminated in the Orange Revolution. My main theoretical aim is to extend earlier work among scholars of social movements on the articulation of hybrid collective action repertoires within Leninist regimes (Mueller 1999) to explore the hybrid forms collective action takes within postcommunist countries (Hrycak 2006; Hrycak forthcoming 2007a; Johnson 2005)."
0,"Cultural sociology has recently developed new tools with which to understand and analyze meaning in terms of cultural discourse. Specifically, this paper further develops the Alexanderian form of discourse analysis through application on the micro-level. Utilizing extensive ethnographic data, the Burning Man counterculture is examined in terms of how its participants construct cultural meaning that motivates and guides their action. In empirical detail, these actors can be seen as creating a cultural discourse that constitutes their countercultural movement at a fundamental level while at the same time the discourse is continually negotiated, contested, and reconfigured. Exposed is the discourse of the Burning Man counterculture which is used by participants to challenge and confront mainstream American society. Examining the Burning Man counterculture from this perspective demonstrates the analytic utility of this approach through revealing in unique ways the dynamics of morality, political belief, and perceived hegemony within this contemporary countercultural movement."
0,"Many theories either implicitly or explicitly assume that individuals readily move to places that improve their financial well-being. Other forces, however, offset these tendencies; for example, people often wish to remain close to family and friends. We introduce a methodology for determining how individuals weigh these countervailing forces, and estimate how both financial and social factors influence geographic mobility in the Danish population. Our results suggest that individuals respond to opportunities for higher pay elsewhere, but that their sensitivity to this factor pales in comparison to their preferences for living near family and friends."
0,"Building on prior work surrounding negative workplace experiences, such as bullying and sexual harassment, we examine the extent to which organizational context is meaningful for the subjective experience of sex discrimination. Data draw on the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce, which provides a key indicator of individuals' sex discrimination experiences as well as arguably influential dimensions of organizational context-i.e., sex composition, workplace culture and relative power-suggested by prior research. Results indicate that the experience of sex discrimination is reduced for both women and men when they are part of the numerical majority of their work group. Although supportive workplace cultures mitigate the likelihood of sex discrimination, relative power in the workplace seems to matter little. We conclude by revisiting these results relative to perspectives surrounding hierarchy maintenance, group competition and internal cultural dynamics."
0,"The Modern Anti-Immigrant Movement has evolved over the last 25 years, responding to changes in US immigration policy, shifting demographics, the re-structuring of the world-economy, and to challenges to the perceived well-being of hegemonic American identity along the lines of culture, race, language, and other social formations.  The peak of the Modern Anti-Immigrant Movement (so far) came in the mid-1990s with the passage of Californias Proposition 187.  Southern California emerged at that time as a hotbed for grassroots anti-immigrant activism.  Today, Southern California continues to be an anti-immigrant hotbed, but the activists ally themselves more than ever with likeminded groups, pundits and politicians nationwide.  President Bushs proposal on January 7, 2004 for amnesty and a guest worker program spiked the anti-immigrant movement once again.  Interviews with 28 leading anti-immigrant activists in California, attendance at several anti-immigrant conferences in Washington, DC and New York, and a review of related ephemera, reveal a strong division between conservatives on the issue of immigration.  One side is pro-immigration, the other is anti-immigration; however, both are anti-immigrant.  Moreover, ethnographic fieldwork on migrant-sending communities in Mexico and El Salvador, combined with this U.S.-based research reveals that both stances reinforce national borders and the racialization of Latino migrants, especially Mexicans, to the benefit of the international division of labor."
0,"This article examines variation in the social position of mixed-race populations by exploiting county-level variation in the degree of occupational differentiation between blacks and mulattoes in the 1880 U. S. census. The role of the mixed-race category as either a ""buffer class"" or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status."
0,"Social capital is a variable resource embedded in all social networks. Although the majority of work on social capital describes it as contributing to socially beneficial outcomes, it also contributes to deviant activities. In addition to laying a theoretical basis for understanding the deviant potentials of social capital, this paper argues that a change in social networks results in a change in social capital. Using data collected from adult drug courts in Wyoming, multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses and analyses of personal interviews were used to explore changes in the social capital of drug court participants. However, as a result of deficiencies in available data, questions remain as to the long-term social circumstances of participants after graduating from the programs and differences in social outcomes among minority groups. The results from this project have implications for future research conducted on drug courts and the theory of social capital."
0,"This paper addresses Latino political participation using a broadened approach along two dimensions: engagement and capacity.  The first dimension, political engagement, focuses on the impact of social capital, political efficacy and political awareness on conventional and unconventional forms of political involvement.  For the second, I consider the role of contextual factors to examine Latinos political capacity.  To do so, I extend political opportunity structure (POS) and resource mobilization models to make new predictions about how characteristics of the environment in which Latinos are embedded, influence their participation as a whole.  I test these new predictions using three sets of dependent variables: broad, conventional participation; broad, unconventional participation; and Latino-oriented, unconventional participation.  Data for the individual-level analysis are drawn from the 1999 National Survey on Latinos in America (NSLA).  Data for the contextual analysis are gathered from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials, the Initiative and Referendum Institute, and census population statistics and reports.  Using logistic regression, I test predictions about how individual-level factors influence Latinos participation within the context of the larger political system.  Using a social movement approach to explain electoral and non-electoral forms of political involvement, I find that Latinos political engagement and capacity are largely influenced by individual- and state-level attributes.  The results have important implications for Latinos political incorporation given demographic trends in this country."
0,"The corporate accounting scandals of 2001 and 2002 have drawn attention to the role of financial accounting in late capitalism.  This paper explores the important social intermediation played by accounting in shaping communication between firms and secondary financial markets. The paper begins by examining the use of accounting manipulation or earnings management for speculative gain, focusing especially upon the opportunity for such manipulation created by ambiguous accounting rules surrounding financial innovation. Financial accounting creates a highly structured communication and signaling channel that must be employed by corporate actors wishing to influence financial markets.  Financial accounting also serves as an enforcement mechanism in speculative capitalism."
0,"Who is ultimately responsible for the harms that befall us?  Corporations who make dangerous products, or the consumers who use them?  The answer to this question has a profound impact on how personal injury lawyers screen products liability cases.  In this paper, I analyze results from an experimental vignette study in which 83 lawyers were asked to evaluate a hypothetical products liability case.  Half of the lawyers practice in states considered to be difficult jurisdictions for the practice of personal injury law due to tort reform and conservative political climates (Texas and Colorado), while the other half work in states that have been relatively unaffected by tort reform and are considered to be more plaintiff friendly (Pennsylvania and Massachusetts).  While lawyers in reform states and non-reform states were equally likely to accept the hypothetical case with which they were presented, they approached the case in different ways, used different theories, and made different arguments in order to justify their acceptance of the case."
0,"We test Mackinnon and Langfords (1994) identity theory of the meaning of occupational prestige rankings among Americans and Canadians with Japanese data. Stratification researchers normally assume that societal prerequisites of education and the rewards of income give cognitive meaning to occupational prestige scores. The Mackinnon and Langford path analytic model demonstrates how North American affective meaning in the form of the moral worthiness of occupations directly and indirectly influence occupational prestige scores. Because many scholars regard Japan as exceptionalist, our analyses shed light on whether the affective and cognitive mechanisms underlying occupational prestige rankings are universalistic or particularistic. Japanese occupational prestige appears to be a function of an individuals educational attainment and the authority bestowed by his or her occupation. We propose McPhersons model of Blau-space for explaining significant dissimilarities with the North American model."
0,"Using an event history framework we analyze the adoption rate of national human rights institutions. Neo-realist perspective predicts adoption rates to be positively influenced by favorable national profiles that lower the costs and make it more reasonable to establish these institutions. From a world polity perspective adoption rates will be positively influenced by a world saturated with human rights organizations and conferences, by increasing adoption densities, and by greater linkages to the world polity. We find support for both perspectives in the analysis of the human rights commission. Only the changing state of the world polity is consequential for the founding of the classical ombudsman office. We discuss the national incorporation of international human rights standards and its relevance to issues of state sovereignty and national citizenship."
0,"Although the relationship between educational attainment and parenting practices is well documented, it is typically examined at only one point in time. What happens if mothers acquire more education after the birth of their children: do they alter their parenting practices? Panel data models based on longitudinal data from ECLS-K indicate that changes in mother's educational attainment are positively associated with increases in parental school involvement, having books in the home, and participating in non-academic family activities, but not with attitudes toward discipline. Although post-natal maternal education does not change all aspects of parenting, our findings are broadly consistent with the theory of cultural mobility and provide insights into the extent of socio-cultural mobility in contemporary American society.

0,"High cost barriers and immigration policy restrictions prevent many low-capital migrants from realizing their destination preferences. However, interviews with 95 Filipino domestic workers in the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore reveal how these low-capital migrants can intentionally follow a stepwise international migration trajectory, working their way up a hierarchy of destination countries and accumulating sufficient migrant capital in the process so as to eventually gain legal entry into their preferred destinations, often in the West. Such a trajectory differs from more frequently studied migration patterns in its number of stages, duration, intentionality, hierarchical progression, and dynamic nature."
0,"In recent years, a number of excellent ethnographic and qualitative studies have signaled a growing interest among scientists in immigrants and their religious practices. Few large-scale studies, however, have examined the religious practices and family religious context of Asian immigrant adolescents. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a large nationally representative survey, we explore the important associations between ethnic and family contexts and Asian American adolescents' religiosity. Specifically, we find that first generation Asian American adolescents report higher levels of public and private aspects of religiosity than their native-born counterparts; Filipino and Korean immigrant adolescents report higher religiosity than Chinese immigrant children; however, the most important factor influencing Asian immigrant children's religiosity is their parent's religious practices and the concordance between parent and adolescent's religious affiliations. Protestant Asian adolescents who are also from a Protestant family report higher religiosity than Buddhist or Catholic adolescents who are from a Buddhist or Catholic family. Implications of these patterns for the intergenerational transmission of religious faith and other aspects of immigrant religious practices are discussed."
0,"A key argument of Massey and Denton's (1993) American Apartheid is that racial residential segregation and non-white group poverty rates combine interactively to produce spatially concentrated poverty. Despite a compelling theoretical rationale, empirical tests of this proposition have been negative or mixed. This article develops a formal decomposition model that expands Massey's model of how segregation, group poverty rates, and other spatial conditions combine to form concentrated poverty. The revised decomposition model allows for income effects on cross-race neighborhood residence and interactive combinations of multiple spatial conditions in the formation of concentrated poverty. Applying the model to data reveals that racial segregation and income segregation within race contribute importantly to poverty concentration, as Massey argued. Almost equally important for poverty concentration, however, is the disproportionate poverty of blacks' and Hispanics' other-race neighbors. It is thus more accurate to describe concentrated poverty in minority communities as resulting from three segregations: racial segregation, poverty-status segregation within race, and segregation from high- and middle-income members of other racial groups. The missing interaction Massey expected in empirical tests can be found with proper accounting for the factors in the expanded model."
0,Experimental estimates from Moving to Opportunity (MTO) show no significant impacts of moves to lower-poverty neighborhoods on adult economic self-sufficiency four to seven years after random assignment. The authors disagree with Clampet-Lundquist and Massey's claim that MTO was a weak intervention and therefore uninformative about neighborhood effects. MTO produced large changes in neighborhood environments that improved adult mental health and many outcomes for young females. Clampet-Lundquist and Massey's claim that MTO experimental estimates are plagued by selection bias is erroneous. Their new nonexperimental estimates are uninformative because they add back the selection problems that MTO's experimental design was intended to overcome.
0,"Nearly all of sociology's top graduate training programs require their students to complete one or two courses on sociological theory. The instructors for these courses have an extraordinary opportunity to affect the perspectives and practices of future generations of scholars. This study assesses the backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and practices of those instructors regarding different approaches to theorizing, with particular attention paid to topics related to science and to theory construction. Sociologists who teach required theory courses in the discipline's top fifty graduate training programs were asked a series of questions pertaining to their own training and to the courses they were teaching: attitudes toward different kinds of theorizing, perceptions of the role that theory plays in sociology and in science, and views on the nature of science. Results indicate a strong consensus on the most important classical theorists (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). However, attitudes and practices varied widely in regard to other classical theorists, contemporary sociological theory, and the role of scientific standards in the development of sociological knowledge. The author explores some of the implications of these attitudes and practices."
0,"Past research in both the transitions to adulthood literature and cultural sociology more broadly suggests that the working class relies on traditional cultural models in their construction of identity. In the contemporary post-industrial world, however, traditional life pathways are now much less available to working-class men and women. I draw on 93 interviews with black and white working-class young people in their 20s to 30s and ask, in an era of increasing uncertainty, where traditional markers of adulthood have become tenuous, what kinds of cultural models do working-class young people employ to validate their adult identities? In contrast to previous studies of working-class identity, I found that respondents embraced a model of therapeutic selfhood-that is, an inwardly directed self preoccupied with its own psychic development. I demonstrate that the therapeutic narrative allows working-class men and women to redefine competent adulthood in terms of overcoming a painful family past. Respondents required a witness to validate their performances of adulthood, however, and the inability to find one left many lost in transition."
0,"This article explores the extent to which macro-level characteristics of destination countries, origin countries, and immigrant communities help explain differences in immigrant children educational achievement. Using data from the 2003 PISA survey, we analyze the mathematical performance of 7,403 pupils from 35 different origin countries in 13 Western countries of destination. While compositional differences offer some explanatory power, they cannot fully explain cross-national and cross-group variance. Contextual attributes of host countries, origin countries, and communities are also meaningful. In this regard, strict immigration laws explain immigrant children better educational performance in traditional immigrant-receiving countries. Results further suggest that origin countries' level of economic development can negatively affect immigrant children educational performance, and that immigrant children from more politically stable countries perform better at school. Finally, socioeconomic differences between immigrant communities and a native population, and relative community size, both shape immigrant children scholastic achievement."
0,"This research expands upon organizational ecology theory to examine variations in founding of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental justice movement across U.S. counties for two time periods (1990-1999 and 2000-2008). Cross-movement effects are examined to determine if founding is more or less likely to occur in counties where related civil rights and environmental organizations are located. Consistent with the notion of agglomeration effects, we hypothesize that during the 1990s the relationship among civil rights density, environmental density, and environmental justice founding is positive and suggests cooperative efforts. That is, environmental justice organizations should form in counties where civil rights organizations and environmental organizations exist. Because the focus of environmental justice organizations may have expanded over time and created a more competitive atmosphere, cross-movement relationships that were positive across counties during the 1990s are hypothesized to turn negative across counties during the 2000s. Multivariate analysis suggests mixed support for these hypotheses. Specifically, civil rights density is positively associated with environmental justice founding during the 1990s and negatively associated with environmental justice founding during the 20005 suggesting potential cooperative and then competitive effects across counties over time. However, the correlations between environmental density and environmental justice founding, while positive and statistically significant during the 1990s, are not statistically significant during the 2000s. Thus, in the case of organizations in the formalized sector of the environmental and environmental justice movements it appears that there is a trend toward competitive effects even as those effects have yet to materialize."
0,"The events of September 11, 2001 forced Americans to personally confront trauma, fears and questions about death, global relations, humanity and the role of America in the world. School-age children were not immune from this media-saturated event. Educators and interested members of the public have conflicting opinions about the role of September 11 in elementary classrooms. My research question is, to what extent do schools and teachers, particularly in their social studies curriculum, differ in their approaches immediately following the event, as well as toward the commemoration of September 11? This paper involves the study of three elementary schools of varying religious backgrounds and different social compositions, concerning their educational approaches toward the events of September 11. The goal is to provide glimpses into the philosophies and missions of these schools by studying how teachers and principals reactions to September 11 played out in the classroom and in the school. Within this goal, I study equity among the three schools in terms of opportunities to learn about the world. My findings were multifaceted: they showed 1) that none of the schools responded in overt ways to the events of September 11; 2) that the religious nature of schools did affect how and what schools taught in response to September 11 and 3) that how a school responds to an event like September 11 is a provocative way to discover the culture or underlying philosophy of a school."
0,"While political opportunity structure theory details how social movement organization (SMO) campaigns focus on the state and political processes, a shift toward neoliberal policies prompts those actors to target corporations directly in order to achieve their goals. This shift creates new challenges for social movements. Unlike the state, corporations are not guided by a democratic ethos, which limits movement organizations' access to decision makers. To achieve access, challenging groups often adopt institutionalized structures and tactics, which can also increase the risk of co-optation. Despite previous research, both the process of co-optation and the distinction between co-optation and other movement outcomes remain unclear. Here, applying event structure analysis to a specific case separates these outcomes: the international campaign the environmental organization Greenpeace waged to change Coca-Cola's refrigeration practices between 1998 and 2005. This analysis suggests that framing is an important strategy for SMOs to utilize, but may not be effective unless frames are backed by action. The combination of framing, institutional tactics, and noninstitutional tactics may be most effective in movement-firm interactions. Overall, this analysis contributes to a broader understanding of social movement tactics, outcomes, and framing in an age of increased corporate power. Keywords: framing, co-optation, corporate campaign, neoliberalism, event structure analysis."
0,"Research on political attitudes has traditionally assumed that group effects combine in an additive fashion. There are, however, some arguments suggesting that influences will combine in a more complex manner. In particular, it is possible that there are regional differences in the effects of various factors. Using data from the General Social Survey (1972-2002), we consider the possibility of regional differences in the effects of two important influences on political views, race and education. We find that the interaction effects involving region, race, and education are statistically significant and large enough to be of substantive interest, and provide some discussion of the nature of the differences."
0,"McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears (2006, 2008b) reported that Americans' social networks shrank precipitously from 1985 to 2004. When asked to list the people with whom they discussed ""important matters,"" respondents to the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS) provided about one-third fewer names than did respondents in the 1985 survey Critically, the percentage of respondents who provided no names at all increased from about 10 percent in 1985 to about 25 percent in 2004. The 2004 results contradict other relevant data, however and they contain serious anomalies: this suggests that the apparently dramatic increase in social isolation is an artifact. One possible source of the artifact is the section of the 2004 interview preceding the network question; it may have been unusually taxing. Another possible source is a random technical error With as yet no clear account for these inconsistencies and anomalies, scholars should be cautious in using the 2004 network data. Scholars and general readers alike should draw no inference from the 2004 GSS as to whether Americans' social networks changed substantially between 1985 and 2004; they probably did not."
0,"Relatively few studies examine the relationship between racial residential segregation and educational or cognitive outcomes. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the institutional resources model of neighborhood effects, I investigate one account of how macrostructural arrangements between race, neighborhood segregation, and school quality interact to produce inequalities in test scores. Consistent with the institutional resources model, results suggest that school quality varies across neighborhoods based, in part, on their degree of racial concentration. Indeed, school quality and other school characteristics mediate the relationship between racial concentration and verbal skills, particularly among black males. These findings have implications not only for inequalities in cognitive skills among blacks across residential space, but also between blacks and whites given high levels of residential segregation in the United States. In sum, findings illustrate yet another way in which residential segregation contributes to, and not merely reflects, racial inequalities. "
0,"Why do states lose the capacity to finance the expansionist military policies, economic development strategies, or domestic spending initiatives they once supported? The path-dependent models offered by fiscal-military, rational choice, and geopolitical theorists are evaluated in comparison with an elite conflict model of contingent historical change. The latter model is found to be better able to explain territorial and fiscal stagnation and decline as well as imperial expansion in the cases of early modern Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Britain."
0,"As cohabitation has risen dramatically in the past few decades among adults of all ages, it is possible that middle-and older-aged parents are ""learning"" cohabitation from their young adult children. The present study uses this theory as a guiding framework to determine if parents are more likely to cohabit themselves following the start of a young adult child's cohabitation. Using three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 275), results show that union formation patterns are influenced by young adult children among parents who are single at their child's 18th birthday. Parents are less likely to marry than remain single and are much more likely to cohabit than marry if they have a young adult child who cohabits. These results show support for the hypotheses."
0,"Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death for Hispanic men; specifically over 30 percent of Hispanic men have cardiovascular disease (Sobralske and Lee, 2010).  Cardiovascular disease is the end result of prolonged hypertension, of which 21.5 percent of Hispanics suffer (CDC, 2009). About 69 percent of Hispanic males lack a usual health care provider (Livingston, Minushkin, Cohn, 2008).  Existing research suggests common casual factors that play a role for the lack of health care utilization in the Hispanic male population include, but are not limited to; language barriers (Hunter et al., 2007; Schur and Albers, 1996), socioeconomic and cultural demographics (CDC, 2010), and machismo (Hunter et al. 2007). This study compiles existing literature as a systematic literature review that analyzes Hispanic male’s overall health and the contributing factors to low healthcare utilization.  The purpose is to identify and compare existing psychosocial and cultural factors that influence males’ decision to see medical care for hypertension."
0,"Polish farmers became politically contentious after democratization in 1989, despite their minimal involvement in the Solidarity movement. I test the effectiveness of social movement theories in explaining this phenomenon by examining frequency and intensity of protest from 1980-1995. I find that grievance models have little explanatory power, political opportunity accounts for the frequency of protest, and resource mobilization offers insight into both frequency and intensity of protests. Supplementing existing theories, I offer qualitative evidence that development programs designed to restructure agricultural cooperatives created mobilizing structures. The reforms were intended to help family farmers adapt to the new market economy, but because most protests targeted liberalization policies, I conclude that in their short-term success, development agencies inadvertently subsidized the cost of collection action against their long-term goals."
0,"Cantor and Land (1985) developed a theoretical model that proposed two pathways through which economic activity - as indexed by the aggregate unemployment rate could affect the rate of criminal activity. The first is by increasing levels of criminal motivation within the population as deteriorating economic conditions affect social strain and social control; the second is by influencing the availability and vulnerability of criminal targets and thus the number of criminal opportunities. Although much empirical research has applied this theoretical model, few analyses have done so at disaggregated units of analysis. We present the most comprehensive analysis to date by empirically evaluating this model with data on 400 of the largest US counties - and examine the effects of aggregation on results as these county data are combined to the state and national levels - for the years 1978-2005. For seven Index crimes at each of the three levels of analysis, and with or without controls for structural covariates at each level, the directional effects hypothesized by Cantor and Land are found for 78 out of 84 estimated relationships. Even after taking into account the lack of statistical independence of these estimates by drawing on recently developed statistical theory, this is a very unlikely outcome. In accordance with expectations based on theory and prior research, (a) some of these relationships are weak and not statistically significant, and (b) the strongest and most consistent patterns of relationships for both the crime opportunity and crime motivation effects are found for three property crimes: burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Suggestions for further research on this topic are given. "
0,"Generalized trust has become a paramount topic throughout the social sciences, in its own right and as the key civic component of social capital. To date, cross-national research relies on the standard question: ""Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?"" Yet the radius problem-that is, how wide a circle of others respondents imagine as ""most people""-makes comparisons between individuals and countries problematic. Until now, much about the radius problem has been speculation, but data for 51 countries from the latest World Values Survey make it possible to estimate how wide the trust radius actually is. We do this by relating responses to the standard trust question to a new battery of items that measures in-group and out-group trust. In 41 out of 51 countries, ""most people"" in the standard question predominantly connotes out-groups. To this extent, it is a valid measure of general trust in others. Nevertheless, the radius of ""most people"" varies considerably across countries; it is substantially narrower in Confucian countries and wider in wealthy countries. Some country rankings on trust thus change dramatically when the standard question is replaced by a radius-adjusted trust score. In cross-country regressions, the radius of trust matters for civic attitudes and behaviors because the assumed civic nature of trust depends on a wide radius."
0,"This research proposal aims to establish a roadmap for the study of industrial policy for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Colombia during and after the transition to a more open economy (late 1980s to date), and of the role of the association that groups the sector, ACOPI. Examinations of economic/industrial policy during this period tend to concentrate in policy affecting large firms. The modest outcomes in industrial policy for SMEs and the limited success of ACOPI, which have been previously documented, suggest that the picture of industrial policy enactment and implementation for this sector is starkly different from the one that emerges from the experience of larger and more powerful firms and warrants further attention. A distinct perspective of examining this association based on development/statist literature is proposed. Industrial policy for SMEs, and the role of ACOPI cant only be seen as an outcome of business, or furthermore, of a powerful (or weak) business association. Effectiveness of industrial policy is dependent upon states capacity, which in turn is determined by a balance of forces between labor, business, and the state. The latter two are extensively examined in the proposal, as to identify key hypotheses that will guide the research project. This is a valuable corrective to the picture that has been suggested through an exclusive focus on the activities of associations, or from the one that emerges from the response to new institutional economics unfolding from political science."
0,"Extant research shows that individuals who discuss politics and current events with their peers also participate more actively in civil society,. However, this correlation is not sufficient evidence of causation due to a number of analytical biases. To address this problem, data were collected through a panel study conducted on students who were randomly assigned to dormitories during their first year of college. In addition, the data were preprocessed before analysis with a matching procedure. These data show that discussing politics and current events caused these students to participate in civic activities during their first year of college. A follow-up study conducted on the same population during their fourth year of college shows that the positive effect of civic talk on civic participation still exists despite the passage of three years. Further analysis shows that the boost in civic participation initially after engaging in civic talk is the mechanism by which the effect of civic talk lasts into the future."
0,"Drawing on an ethnography of queer women in Ithaca, New York, this article documents the perceived costs and benefits for a minority group's ties of changing attitudes, identities, and legislation. It reveals that despite the high proportion of queer women in Ithaca most informants report disappointment with ""community."" However, this disappointment does not correlate with a dearth of affective local ties; queer women detail a wealth of supportive ties to heterosexual and queer neighbors. Informants' simultaneous disappointment with ""community"" and rich local ties emerge from: (1) a shift from identity politics and networks to emphasis on shared cultural, social, and political tastes and activities; (2) the breadth of the queer female population; and (3) queer women's successful integration into Ithaca's social, cultural, and political spheres. From informants' perspectives these conditions weaken ""real"" community, which they associate with homogenous place-based networks of marginalized individuals, and promote a strong sense of ambient community: feelings of belonging and connection that arise from informal, voluntary, and affective ties largely fashioned around shared tastes and activities and predicated on a sense of safety and acceptance forged among heterogeneous proximate individuals. Contra the prevailing expectation that place-based ties best flourish among marginalized individuals who share a dominant identity and formal institutions, the article demonstrates that when social and cultural conditions change local ties change, too they do not simply disappear. Social and cultural shifts alter the foundation of local ties and informants' assessment thereof"
0,"The liberal dilemma hypothesis explains the observed decline in civic engagement in the United States by noting that liberal states cannot cultivate the civic virtues on which their successful operation depends and at the same time maintain their standing as (neutral) liberal states. Applying this logic, as the United States became more liberal along a number of dimensions over the last four decades, it ceased to develop in its citizens the civic virtues that would move them to participate in civic life. Our paper challenges this hypothesis based on a limited test confined to its operation through military service, an institutional experience through which the civic virtues leading to civic engagement are often said to be forged. Drawing on data from a panel study of men living in Houston, we find no evidence that those who volunteered for military service subsequently had higher rates of civic engagement than those who did not volunteer. These findings cast doubt on the claim made by Putnam (2000) and others that military service is a mechanism that helps explain generational differences in rates of civic engagement. In sum, with respect to military service, the United States faces no stark dilemma forcing it to choose between a liberal recruitment policy that neglects educating citizens in civic virtue and a less liberal recruitment policy designed to cultivate civic virtues."
0,"Firms that do not fit into established business categories tend to be overlooked, but new markets often form around these ""misfits."" Because being seen as part of a growing population makes new populations seem real, counting them is important to mainstreaming new markets. Yet, if firms outside the mainstream are overlooked, how can they be counted? Extending the embeddedness perspective to social cognition about markets, this research exposes the media central role in market formation. Using a new method for extracting data about market networks from media coverage, this study demonstrates that early entrants benefit,from inviting coverage that makes a few-but not too many-links to other entrants, thus helping audiences perceive an emerging category. As the market matures, however references to rivals become unhelpful. These findings illustrate the value of a linguistic turn to empirical studies of meaning construction and the reification of social structure."
0,"Conflict escalates through a series of feedback loops. On the micro level, conflict generates conditions for intense interaction rituals, and internal solidarity fuels external conflict. Perceived atrocities reciprocally increase ideological polarization between opponents, while confrontational tension/fear makes violence incompetent and produces real atrocities. Conflict groups seek allies, drive out neutrals, and mobilize material resources. Both sides in a conflict counter-escalate through the same set of feedbacks. Winning and losing are determined by differences between rates of escalation and by attacks that one-sidedly destroy organizational and material capacity. Conflict de-escalates because both sides fail to find conditions for solidarity, cannot overcome confrontational tension/fear, and exhaust their material resources. Emotional burnout sets in through a time dynamic of explosion, plateau, and dissipation of enthusiasm. Defection of allies opens the way for third-party settlement. When both sides remain stalemated, initial enthusiasm and external polarization give way to emergent internal factions-a victory faction (hard-liners) versus a peace faction (negotiators)-creating new conflict identities. Ideals promoted at the outset of conflict become obstacles to resolution at the end."
0,"This article examines four movements of the religiously orthodox that should have failed according to most social movement theory and research. The movements combine (1) an extraordinarily broad agenda, (2) a strict, morally absolutist ideology, and (3) a strong proscription against compromise with other groups, each of which has been identified as a liability that can lead to movement failure. Through inductive, qualitative analyses, the authors identify four shared strategies that helped these movements overcome these obstacles: bypassing the state, building grassroots structures, providing graduated membership, and reprioritizing agendas. Analyses of these movements also suggest that particular combinations of movement ""liabilities"" may actually be advantageous."
0,"This paper reports on preliminary findings from 31 interviews and from participant observation carried out with genealogists from southern Louisiana.  The focus is on that section of the research which examines how respondents deal with finding slave ownership in their families.  Thus far, I have found two main responses: non-judging or empathizing.  Non-judging respondents see slave ownership as something that can not be judged while empathizing respondents struggle with the knowledge of their familys involvement with slavery.  In each case, the process of doing genealogy provides an opportunity for respondents to create narratives to explain past and present racial inequality in their own families and in the U.S. as whole.  Despite the popularity of genealogy, and the ways it may shape participants thinking about race and inequality, there is relatively little sociological research on the intersection of genealogy and race. While sociological theorists of race do extensively address how history has shaped the present racial terrain, they rarely look intensively at how everyday people use and give meaning to history as they grapple with thorny issues concerning race, racial inequality, and racial identities.  I argue that our theory of the reproduction of racial thinking and social structure would be considerably strengthened by attending to the way people of different racial backgrounds give meaning to and actively use history to make sense of their own lives and of larger public discussions about race in the United States."
0,"A growing body of literature weighs the influence of religion on civic life. Largely missing from prior analysis is Pentecostals. With novel religious beliefs and practices, Pentecostals might be expected to focus more on in-group bonding activities than out-group bridging activities. We test this expectation using national data from the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey. We contrast three measures of Pentecostalism: denominational affiliation, speaking in tongues at a place of worship, and self-described Pentecostal/charismatic identity. Results affirm high rates of bonding activity (church attendance and other congregation activity) for contemporary Pentecostals. Results for Pentecostal bridging are more complicated. People in Pentecostal denominations and those who speak in tongues participate less in community organizations and politics. However, this is more a function of social class and general conservatism than religious culture or sense of identity. Comparable to other conservative Protestants, the vitality of Pentecostal groups seems no impediment to democratic society."
0,"Womens magazines have not been used before by scholars to research norms of masculine behavior.  Advice columns and fiction from womens magazines provide useful insights into evaluations and expectations of mens behavior, however, since they explicitly or implicitly describe what is and is not desirable in men.  Magazine content demonstrates contrasts between French and American ideals of the masculine body, demeanor and courtship in the 1950s.  The dominant French masculine ideal of the period is softer, more empathetic and restrained than the American one, which emphasizes the attractiveness of a more rugged, coercive version of masculinity.  These cultural contrasts echo the observations of prior historical observers, and are important to keep in mind when evaluating the reception of second-wave feminism in both countries."
0,"In this paper, we address the connection between movement activity and newspaper coverage through a case study of the Townsend Plan.   We ask three main questions.  First, how closely does SMO coverage correspond to the presence of SMOs, as measured through membership, revenues, and action?  Second, what accounts for why some SMO actions receive coverage and others do not?  We examine all major types of SMO action and thus seek to ascertain whether the same biases regarding protest also apply to other collective action by SMOs.  Third, under which conditions does an SMO receive coverage favorable to its cause?  By this we include whether coverage provides “standing” for an SMO’s representatives, whether its claims receive “resonance” and “legitimacy.”  We also seek to ascertain whether it is possible to correct coverage figures to provide more valid indicators of the presence of movements and gain a better understanding of the relationship between media coverage and movements.  We address these questions through a historical analysis of the Townsend Plan from its rapid emergence in 1934 until the early 1950s, when it lost influence, and its coverage through four major newspapers: the New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times.  In our preliminary results, we find that coverage is significantly correlated with membership and less so with revenues.  We also find that a disproportionate amount of coverage focused on conflict within the organization.   Moreover, favorable coverage was often related to the policy context in which the SMO contested its claims."
0,"A number of studies document a negative relationship between adolescent sexual intercourse and high school educational experiences and outcomes; yet, this research risks conflating the consequences associated with sex in romantic relationships with those that result when sex occurs in other relationship contexts. We predict that, compared to abstinence, intercourse in romantic relationships will have limited consequences for education, whereas the negative effects associated with sex in other relationships will be pronounced. We evaluate our hypothesis with two waves of data on nine measures of educational experiences and outcomes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our results are generally consistent with our predictions: the context in which sexual activity occurs substantially moderates the relationship between sexual intercourse and several education measures. These findings contradict the claims some abstinence-only curricula make regarding the link between adolescent sex and a plethora of negative outcomes. We speculate that such programs reinforce the notion that sex, and in particular sex that occurs in nonromantic relationships, is counternormative. As a result, they may needlessly increase the risk that some sexually active adolescents will have negative educational experiences and outcomes."
0,"The sociology of aging draws on a broad array of theoretical perspectives from several disciplines, but rarely has it developed its own. We build on past work to advance and empirically test a model of mental health framed in terms of structural theorizing and situated within the life course perspective. Whereas most prior research has been based on cross-sectional data, we utilize four waves of data from a nationally representative sample of American adults (Americans' Changing Lives Study) collected prospectively over a 15-year period and find that education, employment and marital status, as well as their consequences for income and health, effectively explain the increase in depressive symptoms after age 65. We also found significant cohort differences in age trajectories of mental health that were partly explained by historical increases in education. We demonstrate that a purely structural theory can take us far in explaining later life mental health."
0,"As key socio-cultural building blocks of human societies, institutions are distinct from organizations and, hence, are central to sociological inquiry. In recent decades, however, institutional analysis has increasingly moved toward the analysis of organizations, while treating ""institutions"" as the environments or fields of organizations. While the insights offered by contemporary organizational theorists have provided important keys to understanding how organizations, especially economic organizations, adapt to pressures within their environments, the authors argue that the Old Institutionalisms of functional theorizing has much to offer the New Institutionalisms. In this article, the Old Institutionalisms are revisited to construct a precise definition of institutions as well as posit a robust theory of institutional dynamics, a theory which supplements contemporary organizational analysis. Four dynamics stand out: the process of institutional autonomy, the intersection of stratification systems and institutions, modes of integration within and between institutions, and generalized symbolic media of exchange. In particular, the latter two occupy the authors' attention primarily as they have been under-theorized elsewhere."
0,"Despite the increased prevalence of neutral third parties in both formal and informal exchange processes, social exchange theory has yet to consider the effect of nonpartisans on important cognitive and affective outcomes of exchange. This research integrates Simmel's conceptualization of small groups and nonpartisans with contemporary theory and research in social exchange to explore how different levels of neutral third party intervention in an exchange process affect the ""relational outcomes"" of exchange (perceptions of fairness of, general positive regard toward, the exchange partner and optimism about the tone of future interactions). Experimental results indicate that increased third party intervention is positively related to favorable relational outcomes. The increased likelihood of external attributions and decreased salience of conflict associated with high levels of third-party intervention partially explain this result."
0,"The muscle gap was a period of Cold War anxiety projected onto the bodies of young, white males that produced a discourse fixated on their perceived softness and openness to communist penetration. The underlying anxiety was that youth would be unable to uphold the national heritage of expansionism built by the hard (white) men of previous generations. Looking at cultural citizenship as a process of subject-formation sheds light on how a racial project can simultaneously be a gender project that (re)produces a racial-gender order where whiteness and hegemonic masculinity are markers and repositories of superiority, domination, and privilege."
0,"I explore medicalization as one aspect of how contemporary high school-age girls and boys socially construct menstruation.  First, I explore 20th century advice books for girls and how U.S. cultural history has medicalized menstruation.  Such cultural practice and the social institutions of health and medicine all intersect and affect adolescents own interpretations.  Then, I draw on data from individual and group interviews of adolescent girls and boys and find that they medicalize menstruation in their own peer cultures.  First, menstruation is presented to teens in a medicalized context, from parents and in health class, which results in an initial definition of menstruation as a medical issue. Second, in their descriptions of what menstruation is, the teens focus on menstruations role in reproduction, rather than on the experiential aspects of menstruation that pervade the rest of their interviews.  Third, the teens descriptions of the process of menstruation, although quite medical, rarely include blood.  Last, menstruation is often referred to as a chronic condition defined by symptoms that require treatment."
0,"Does the effect of religiosity on delinquent behavior depend on moral beliefs? For example, will religious adolescents refrain from using marijuana, even if they do not believe using marijuana is wrong? We addressed this question using data from the third and fourth waves of the National Youth Survey. The results indicated a significant interaction between religiosity and moral beliefs for marijuana use and getting drunk, but not for hitting or property offenses. Religiosity has a stronger effect on marijuana and alcohol use when adolescents also believe these behaviors are wrong. Conversely, when it is not accompanied by strong moral beliefs, religiosity has less of an effect on marijuana use and drinking."
0,"The growth of precarious work since the 1970s has emerged as a core contemporary concern within politics, in the media, and among researchers. Uncertain and unpredictable work contrasts with the relative security, that characterized the three decades following World War II. Precarious work Constitutes a global challenge that has a wide range of consequences cutting across many, areas of concern to sociologists. Hence, it is increasingly important to understand the new workplace arrangements that generate precarious work and worker insecurity. A focus on employment relations forms the foundation of theories of the institutions and structures that generate Precarious work and the cultural and individual factors that influence people's responses to uncertainty. Sociologists are well-positioned to explain, offer insight, and provide input into public policy, about such changes and the state of contemporary employment relations."
0,"In most families today, childcare remains divided unequally between fathers and mothers. Scholars argue that persistence of the gendered division of childcare is due to multiple causes, including values about gender and family, disparities in paid work, class, and social context. It is likely that all of these factors interact, but to date researchers have not explored such interactions. To address this gap, we analyze nationally representative time-use data from Australia, Denmark, France, and Italy. These countries have different employment patterns, social and family policies, and cultural attitudes toward parenting and gender equality. Using data from matched married couples, we conduct a cross-national study of mothers' and fathers' relative time in childcare, divided along dimensions of task (i.e., routine versus non-routine activities) and co-presence (i.e., caring for children together as a couple versus caring solo). Results show that mothers' and fathers' work arrangements and education relate modestly to shares of childcare, and this relationship differs across countries. We find cross-national variation in whether more equal shares result from the behavior of mothers, fathers, or both spouses. Results illustrate the relevance of social context in accentuating or minimizing the impact of individual- and household-level characteristics."
0,"This article analyzes how thirty mainline Protestant clergy who addressed homosexuality in their local congregations positioned themselves within their congregations on the issue. Regardless of their positions, all of the pastors first situated the root causes of religious and broader societal conflicts over homosexuality in an emotion, fear, which they understood as their congregants' fears of sexuality, gay and lesbian people, misinterpreting scripture, and the unknown. Based on their understandings of these fears, clergy then drew from their individual cultural ""toolkits"" to construct personal ""strategies of action"" via personal identities as facilitators, quiet advocates, or more outward advocates around homosexuality in their congregations. The authors analyze the processes by which clergy constructed these identities, with particular attention to the strategies of action attendant within each identity category. This analysis advances substantive knowledge about how clergy respond to homosexuality in local congregations and theoretical knowledge about how religious leaders construct personal identities as one ""strategy of action"" (among many) when addressing controversial social issues in local religious organizations."
0,"In 2006, the Netherlands passed the Health Insurance Act requiring all legal residents to obtain health insurance from private insurance companies. The reform created 1) a national health insurance system guaranteed to all citizens regardless of income or labor force status, and 2) a market orientation that makes private insurance companies the sole providers of health insurance. How does the new policy compare to the U.S. model of private health insurance provision? Is this reform evidence of a shift toward the American model of private health insurance? We use a comparative case study method to compare the new Dutch system to the private insurance system in the United States. We find that although the Dutch system includes market solutions similar to the U.S. model, it still provides a universal guarantee of coverage to all of its citizens and should be viewed as privatization within the Dutch context rather than a cooptation of American health policy."
0,"In Chicago, the redrawing of school boundaries and the closing of failing schools in African American communities has led to an influx of Blacks students to predominantly Latino schools.  Reportedly, this has led to hostility and increased violence between Latino and Black students. These trends highlight a growing national debate on Black and Latino relations as being contentious. Based on ethnographic data (participant observation, interviews, and school newsletters) collected over the course of the 2006-2007 school year, this paper examines and challenges the concept of racially motivated violence in schools. More specifically, it examines the process by which a fight originally about theft came to signify racial tensions between Blacks and Latinos. My analysis reveals that the impetus for violence at Central High was more than just racially motivated as the media and students describe it. Racially motivated violence is a multidimensional and interactional construct involving issues of race, gang rivalries, and masculinity. Placing the blame on race and racial tensions ignores larger social forces at play."
0,"With the rise of deinstitutionalization, the family has become the primary caregiving institution for people with disabilities.   At the same time, advances in medical technologies have helped people of disabilities live longer.  As a result, there are more people with disabilities that require care into their older adult years.  If this population does not marry or live in institutions, the responsibility for care often falls to parents, who provide care until they become too old, require caregiving assistance themselves, or die, siblings may be expected to step into the primary caregiving role. The point of this paper is to: (a) explore to what extent adults with disability are co-resident with healthy siblings, which we operationalize as to be an indicator of caregiving responsibility and (b) what kinds of characteristics are associated with this type of arrangement, including characteristics of the disability as well as the demographic profile of the healthy siblings. Our results show that siblings are one source of care for adults with disabilities, especially for families of color and low-income families.  It is important to understand the household and relational dynamics that ensue from such a household structure, especially if adult siblings fill gaps in the formal system of disability services and do so with incomes in the lowest quartile.  These results merit follow-up with longitudinal analysis and in-depth, qualitative interviews with members of these households."
0,"This paper examines the relationship between specialization and happiness in marriage in the U.S. and Japan. Our findings, based on the General Social Surveys in the U.S. and Japan, indicate both similarities and differences in the determinants of marital happiness in the two countries. In the U.S., the findings are mixed. Women's reported marital happiness in the U.S. is more likely to follow the predictions of the bargaining model where their happiness is determined by their own income. Men's marital happiness in the U.S. follows the predictions of the specialization model; they are happier if their wives are not working or, alternatively, if they are financially dependent on their wives. In Japan, we find support for the specialization model, particularly in the case of women; they are happier if they are specialized in the household and they have a higher household income. Our research highlights how marital quality is affected by the institutional context and the normative environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Despite the abundance of electoral research, a recurring finding is that Asian-Americans in multivariate analyses are less likely to vote compared to all other Americans. Yet Asians have high levels of education and income, the strongest predictors of voting behavior. This article goes beyond individual-level characteristics and examines how the ways in which Asian-Americans are connected to communities moderate individual-level characteristics and influence their electoral participation. Using hierarchical generalized linear modeling, variability in Asian-American voting behavior is studied with 2000 Current Population Survey voting data and county data primarily from the 2000 U.S. Census. The main findings are that social integration, either by highly assimilating communities or through ethnic organizing, facilitates political incorporation and electoral participation. Where neither condition exists, Asian-Americans are less likely to vote."
0,"Educational attainment and school bonding are established predictors of delinquent behavior. In spite of an abundance of research on the relationship between education and delinquency, there is little research that examines the impact of education on stability and change in criminal offending over the life course. This dearth of research is surprising given the increasing significance of post-secondary education in contemporary society and the prominence of the life course approach in the study of crime. The current study uses seven waves of data from the National Youth Survey to examine the impact of higher education on criminal offending over the life course. Findings indicate that college attendance and investment in higher education are negatively associated with criminal offending in adulthood. In addition, the protective effect of higher education is stronger for individuals who were more delinquent during adolescence. Study limitations and future research needs are discussed."
0,"Criminology has devoted substantial research attention to patterns of offending during the transition to early adulthood.  While quantitative changes in the rates of offending have been extensively researched, considerably less attention has been devoted to qualitative shifts in offending during the transition to adulthood.  Qualitative changes in offending behavior would suggest a pattern of displacement or shifts between various types of crime, rather than desistance from deviant behavior.  Using data from the National Youth Survey, I test the extent to which desistance and displacement of deviant behavior are defining attributes of offending during the transition to early adulthood.  While evidence of desistance is present, the results are more supportive of the notion of altering patterns of offending, or within-person displacement, rather than termination of illicit activity."
0,"This paper draws on a sample of 523 institutions of higher education in the United States to test neoinstitutional and diffusion explanations for curricular change. It explores the adoption of programs and majors in womens studies, Asian American studies, and queer/LGBT studies through logistic regression analysis and network visualization. The paper finds less support than expected for conventional neoinstitutional and diffusion explanations while determining that the institutionalization of a discipline in the higher education field increases the role for neoinstitutional pressures. In addition, the paper finds that peer networks based on structural position with the higher education field play less of a role in curricular change than do those peers claimed by institutions as comparison institutions."
0,"This analysis extends prior research on racial inequality in arrest rates by testing opposing hypotheses derived from the civic community tradition in sociology. One interpretation of this perspective suggests that communities with a locally-oriented economic infrastructure, an abundance of civic institutions, and civically engaged citizens should exhibit lower racial disparity in arrest rates. On the other hand, recent writings exposing a potential ""dark side'' of social capital suggest that civic community may exacerbate such racial disparties. Using spatial regression models to analyze data from nearly 1,800 U. S. counties, the current analysis examines these competing hypotheses regarding the effects of civic community. Results suggest mixed support for both the traditional and ""dark side'' predictions. Implications for theory and empirical research are discussed."
0,"Despite recent calls from scholars and practitioners to reverse labor's decline by adopting a social movement orientation, most analyses of labor revitalization remain based on assumptions that it is exclusively an agent in the economic sphere.  In this paper I consider some of the practical and theoretical implications of defining the labor movement narrowly as an economic interest group.  I examine the limitations of using union density as a proxy measure of movement strength, explore the ways analyses of power are confined, and discuss the impact on union organizing strategies and outcomes.  This piece argues that much can be gained by applying a social movements analysis to the study of organized labor."
0,"Symbolic entrapment - which refers to when a person is prevented from taking courses of action because these actions threaten symbolic boundaries that crucially define important and salient social identities - is a ubiquitous part of social life. Previous research suggests that individuals either remain symbolically entrapped or disavow their identities in efforts to escape. By using the case of conservative Christian victims of spousal abuse who divorced their abusive husbands yet remain conservative Christians, I theorize that people escape symbolic entrapment while also maintaining their identities using normative, transforming, and neutralizing vocabularies of motive that make certain courses of action seem appropriate in terms of a group's culture. These motives help individuals escape symbolic entrapment by relieving cognitive dissonance and by providing people with arguments that convince fellow group members of the appropriateness of action. I conclude with empirical, theoretical, and practical implications of this research. Keywords: symbolic entrapment, social identities, vocabularies of motive, intimate partner violence, conservative Christianity."
0,"Past studies have claimed that during the Great Migration the church participation of southern black migrants in northern cities was weakened by the circumstances of urban life. The present study, building on theories of subculture formation and the ethnic niche, challenges this claim by examining the participation of blacks in a religious occupation: the ministry. An analysis of Census data suggests that, in those northern cities with relatively large black populations, a ""critical mass"" of blacks created by in-migration helped to support the entry of blacks into the ministry. The findings are consistent with the assertion that the Great Migration stimulated the church participation of blacks in these cities. They are also in agreement with the argument that the size and distinctive cultural traditions of an ethnic minority group may, together, sustain some of the group's members in a special occupational niche."
0,"This paper aims to conceptually integrate the two main perspectives in urban sociology  human ecology and political economy -- to explain urban sprawl phenomenon. After comparing their focus of studies, assumptions, methodologies, I found these two perspectives are not fundamentally contradictory, but compliment and supplement with each other. Therefore, I suggest an integrative explanation for urban sprawl phenomenon, incorporating both perspectives. Three testable arguments can be derived from the integrative theory: 1) both increase in population and advancement in technology contribute to urban sprawl; 2) state, government and other political intervention also play an important role in accelerating or controlling urban sprawl process; 3) global political and economic inequality and competition is one of main driving forces for the urban development in the third world countries. Finally, the suggestions for future empirical study are discussed."
0,"This paper considers the consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent reunification of East and West Germany on beliefs about women in the labor force among samples in the reunified Germany over a thirteen-year period from 1991-2004.  This set of circumstances provides a natural experiment for examining the relationship between socialization during youth and the impact of social and historical change on later-life gender beliefs.  We suggest that how Germans have adapted to their new social reality will inform our understanding of the mechanisms of change in a population. Do individuals, in the face of dramatic demographic and socioeconomic change, maintain their beliefs from youth, in this case preserving the gap in gender beliefs between East and West present at the time of reunification?  Did the new social context only influence the beliefs of cohorts reaching early adulthood in the new Germany?  Or, alternatively, did even earlier-born cohorts, already established in their careers and families before reunification, change their beliefs about gender and family with the merging of East and West?  Using data from the series of ALLBUS and ISSP surveys for Germany beginning in 1982 (including East Germany from 1991 onward) we find support for the conclusion that there are continued changes toward more egalitarian gender beliefs in the reunified Germany across time. Cohort replacement effects on change in gender beliefs are strongest in the West, with the impact of the social and economic changes brought about by reunification strongest in the East."
0,"This paper examines the dynamics of spouses' division of labor in the course of the first 14 years of marriage in West Germany. We tackle the question of whether norm oriented sociological theories or economic approaches are better suited to explain the changes in husband's and wife's relative contribution to housework. We find that men's relative contribution to housework is declining in the course of marriage. Increase in their relative involvement is the exception. However, any mode of division of work in the household, once established, becomes stable and is then unlikely to be changed. Evidence of event-history analyses applied to the longitudinal data from the Bamberg Panel Study of Married Couples further indicate that economic action theories fail to explain these processes. Consistent interpretations arise when taking normative considerations into account. Our findings support the view that traditional and egalitarian gender norms co-exist, but neither these processes themselves, nor their interaction with the gendered division of labor dynamics are at present theoretically well understood. We introduce the idea of shifting normative frameworks in the context of family formation to recognize the co-existence of gender egalitarian and traditional fairness norms from a life course perspective."

0,"I want to raise some questions about the relationship between the sociology of intellectuals and the sociology of knowledge, and to evaluate some of Randall Collinss and Pierre Bourdieus use of concepts.  I want to argue, first, for using the concepts of Bourdieu, Collins, and others in a way that can overcome what I believe are a limitation of their schemas, namely, that they the factors they highlight are impossible to measure, that they have created models from which nothing can escape; and second, for considering a greater range of cultural factors and structures of thought.  These limitations derive, not from their use of somehow false or inappropriate concepts, but from the effort to universalize their models, which transform them from ideal-typical and hermeneutically-useful perspectives for measuring the world into adequate and sufficient explanatory models or descriptions.  They have thus insulated sociology of knowledge from the multi-dimensionality of culture, to use an expression of Jeffrey Alexanders, by making claims that go beyond what can be justified and restricting what can serve as relevant data, by excluding other spheres of experience from a role in the decisive production of thought."
0,"Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and three US. censuses, we examine how the composition of extralocal areas-areas surrounding a householder's neighborhood of residence-shapes the likelihood that Whites will move out of their neighborhoods. Net of local neighborhood conditions and other predictors of residential mobility, high concentrations of minorities in surrounding neighborhoods reduce the likelihood that Whites will move, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of nearby residential alternatives. Notably, this effect also suppresses the influence of the racial composition of the immediate neighborhood on White out-migration. Recent growth in the size of an extralocal minority population increases the likelihood of White out-migration and accounts for much of the influence previously attributed to racial changes in the local neighborhood. High levels of minority concentration in surrounding neighborhoods also exacerbate the positive effect of local minority concentration on White out-migration. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond reactions to local racial conditions to understand mobility decisions and resulting patterns of segregation."
0,"Drawing from a qualitative pilot study on Northern Virginia immigrant Latinos, this paper will address an important aspect of the immigrant experience that has unfortunately received little emphasis: the entrepreneurial capacity of skilled Latino and Latina workers in both manual and professional occupations. The question that drives our research is straightforward: What social factors help explain why rates of Latino business formation and self-employment the traditional routes to immigrant integration and empowerment have lagged behind those of other immigrant groups? Through in-depth interviews (N=75) with Latino and Latina immigrants from both working- and middle-class backgrounds, we will examine the degree to which social, organizational and cultural factors impinge on their economic activities. We expect preliminary findings of this study will draw attention to the multiple contributions the Latino community stands to make through the establishment of business ventures that can provide levels of economic integration and growth that have not yet been fully tapped. Further, we anticipate that such findings will be of use to social policies adopted by decision makers in the region, including human service organizations, business groups, and non-governmental organizations as well."
0,"Small support groups are a relatively new form of voluntary association appearing in the American landscape. Examining the larger implications of the osmall group movemento for civic life has led some to see an overall positive effect on wider community activities, while others have viewed small-group participants as self-absorbed and withdrawing from participation in civic activities. Using a national sample of small-group participants, we examine the effects on civic engagement stemming from the social characteristics of participants, the type of small group (religious, secular, or mixed), and the opportunity to develop social capital through participation in small groups. Findings indicate that members of religious small groups do not actively engage in civic affairs, but members of secular and mixed groups do participate in a broad range of civic activities. Differences in social participation can be attributed to characteristics of the small groups (formalization and cohesion) and to some characteristics of members (education). When small support groups offer members the opportunity to acquire civic skills, to exchange information, and to develop self-efficacy, there is more interest and activity in civic affairs."
0,"Focusing on post-Soviet Ukraine, this paper examines how social transformations changed family formation, leading to the world's lowest fertility rate. The findings show that before Ukraine gained independence, highly educated women had higher first birth rates after controlling for school enrollment and marriage. After independence, highly educated women began to delay childbearing. In contrast, second birth and marriage rates declined after independence, but the effect of education on these events did not change. Explanations for the changing affects of education on first births include the restructured educational system, shifting opportunity costs, reduction in childcare benefits, and exposure to new, ideas and values. This study demonstrates how societal-level change not only alters the composition of individual-level characteristics in a population, but also affects the relationship between factors and behavior."
0,"On December 14, 2010, feminist blogger Sady Doyle started a Twitter campaign to protest the public misrepresentation by documentarian Michael Moore of rape allegations against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. The protest attracted hundreds of participants who produced thousands of tweets directed at Moore’s Twitter account, grouped under the label #MooreandMe. The protest, guided by Doyle’s updates at her blog, garnered widespread media publicity and support from other social justice and feminist activists, raised thousands of dollars for rape survivor nonprofits, and prompted Moore to publicly state on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC news program on December 21 that all rape allegations should be taken seriously, no matter the timing or the person under scrutiny. In this paper I explain why this digital protest was successful and suggest that this campaign exemplifies the unique visibility of the negotiation of goals, tactics, and measures of success in digital protests, as well as highlights aspects of social protest that have previously gone underemphasized. The detailed public record, down to the most minor of interactions, of how the #MooreandMe protest was carried out is a boon to social movements scholars, but also compels them to reexamine their assumptions about the nature and efficacy of protest in a digital age."
0,"Dominant theories to explain the emergence and persistence of low fertility, such as the Second Demographic Transition, have developed from observations of behaviors in Western Europe. I explore their applicability in the Global South by examining behaviors associated with below-replacement fertility in India. Using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), I show that the ordering of lifecourse events among women in India’s low-fertility states remains consistent with the demographic transition: marriage followed by childbirth, with childbearing largely concentrated early in marriage. Taking a longitudinal perspective, I find that changes across successive birth cohorts of women in Kerala, the only major state in India at replacement levels since the late 1980s, are consistent with the demographic transition: for most women, fertility in marriage is concentrated in their early-to-late twenties followed by sterilization. Findings suggest that to-date below-replacement fertility in India does not reflect a new demographic transition, as in much of Europe, North America and East Asia."
0,"The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of how the family influences academic performance. Using Latent Growth modeling, we found ineffective parenting, parental expectations and deviant peer associations mediated the relationship between family background and older sibling academic performance. While parent variables were predictive of older sibling academic performance, this was not true for younger siblings. Our findings suggest a strong older sibling influence on younger sibling academic performance even when controlling for parental influences. A decline in older sibling academic performance places younger siblings at risk for academic failure. We demonstrate the utility of LGM methodology as an effective tool in the study of status attainment with longitudinal data."
0,"This paper examines possible homologies between symbolic and material structures in the contemporary field of popular music. Departing from the theoretical perspective of Bourdieu’s field theory, which emphasizes the importance of discursive and symbolic structures to the institutionalization of field structures, the question is addressed whether the partitioning of the field of popular music on the material level in terms of a division between ‘independent’ and ‘major’ record companies is ‘articulated’ in symbolic divisions in critical and evaluative discourses. Through a relational content analysis of 6820 reviews of 457 popular music albums in 57 different popular music publications in the year 2004, a ‘critical discourse space’ is modeled in which the niche locations of producers are analyzed. The investigation of homologies in the symbolic and material structures, which this measurement strategy allows, shows that the boundary between ‘restricted’ and ‘large-scale’ producers remains a symbolically pertinent distinction in the field of popular music."
0,"This paper provides a methodological and analytic approach for studying the relationship between personal transition, group association, and political commitment in neighborhood activism.  Focusing on a central neighborhood political institution as a heuristic device, I use ethnographic methods to demonstrate how people who initiate participation from distinct social positions in a field of neighborhood relations make use of the same political space through various pathways into and out of group association and political commitment.  The result is a highly textured picture of neighborhood participation, which bridges together theories of collective action, group processes, and political commitment through a sociological perspective of individual courses of action."
0,"Urban renewal in South Africa involves contending with a combination of high crime rates, increasing inequality and growing public frustration.   In Cape Town, urban planners are attempting to stimulate economic growth, in part, by turning the city into a 'world class' destination for investment and tourists.  In taking this approach to economic development renewal authorities cite crime as the primary obstacle to urban renewal.  This study examines the politics of urban renewal in Cape Town's Central Business District, paying particular attention to efforts to control the presence of street children in the central city.  I argue that the attention given to street children and the negative impact they allegedly have on urban renewal constitutes a moral panic driven by and contributing to a vision of development that leaves relatively untouched the inequalities of apartheid.  In defining street children primarily as a threat to social order, local elites, including the media, police and renewal authorities, are reproducing deeply embedded notions of a 'Black menace' that emerge during times of real or perceived social upheaval and threats to social 'order'.  My contention is that this panic is indicative of an ongoing struggle over urban public space that expresses a deeper conflict over changes in the City having to do with unresolved contradictions of race and class.  This criminalisation of street children raises doubts as to how well progressive approaches to crime reduction and development will survive urban renewal efforts that many feel reproduce the City's division into developed and underdeveloped areas."
0,"In this paper, I examine the relationship between social factors and the comorbidity of physical and psychological problems.  I refer to the co-occurrence of one or more physical health problems in combination with one or more psychiatric disorders as across-domain comorbidity.  While previous research indicates clear evidence of same-domain comorbidity of physical health problems and same-domain comorbidity of psychiatric disorders, research has not established across-domain comorbidity.  Furthermore, to date, research has failed to assess the social distribution of across-domain comorbidity and largely ignores the ways in which social factors predict different combinations of psychiatric and physical disorders.  Using data from the National Comorbidity Survey, I find the existence of across-domain comorbidity and examine the differences in the social distributions of same-domain psychiatric comorbidity and same-domain physical comorbidity compared to across-domain comorbidity.  Moreover, certain social statuses serve as predictors of particular types of illness outcomes (e.g., no symptoms/problems, having only one physical health problem or only one psychiatric disorder, same-domain comorbidity, or across-domain comorbidity).  Taken together, these findings suggest the need for further theoretical and empirical work acknowledging the different types and/or combinations of illnesses people suffer from and the social factors predicting these types/combinations of outcomes."
0,"Against a backdrop of two new developments in the fertility behavior of the Mexican Origin population, the present discussion will update contemporary Mexican American fertility patterns and address several theoretical weaknesses in the current approach to minority group fertility.  Data come from six national surveys (three from Mexico and three from the U.S.) that cover a twenty-five year period (1975-2000).  The findings demonstrate dramatic decreases in the fertility rates within Mexico at the same time that continuous increases have been documented in the fertility rates of third-or-later generation Mexican Americans in the U.S., particularly at younger ages.  These changes necessitate a reexamination of the ubiquitous theory that Mexican pronatalist values are responsible for the high fertility rates found within the Mexican Origin population in the U.S.  Instead, they point to the increasing relevance of framing the fertility behavior of the Mexican Origin population within a racial stratification perspective that stresses the influence of U.S. social context on fertility behavior.  As a step in this direction, the analysis examines fertility patterns within the Mexican Origin population in the U.S. Special attention is given to the role of nativity/generational status in contributing to within group differences."
0,"This study examines both how parenthood shapes physical activity across the life course as well as if the processes through which parenthood shapes physical activity differs for men and women and African Americans and Whites. In order to answer these questions, we integrate theoretical work on social ties and health behavior, the life course, and the second shift to frame an analysis of in-depth interview data with 44 parents. Results indicate that mothers and fathers of minor children have very divergent experiences: while motherhood is more likely to be a barrier to physical activity, especially for African American mothers, fatherhood is rarely experienced as a barrier to physical activity and many fathers are able to combine fathering responsibilities with exercise. In contrast, both mothers and fathers of adult children feel that being healthy and alive for their children motivate them to exercise, although only mothers report that their adult children explicitly encourage them to exercise. These results suggest that parenthood shapes physical activity in different ways across the life course and in different ways for men and women and African Americans and Whites."
0,"Using data from the Fragile Families Study, we examine how unmarried parents' risk of divorce influences their decision to marry. Regression results show that unmarried parents with a high predicted probability of marital dissolution (based on estimates of marital dissolution for a sample of initially married mothers with similar characteristics) had significantly lower odds of marriage to the father of their child even after controlling for individual and relationship characteristics expected to influence marriage transitions. The dissolution propensity we examine also includes a measure of the local divorce climate. As such, our results provide support for the argument that high rates of divorce in the population have led to a fear of divorce among unmarried parents which reduces their probability of marriage.

0,"This article examines persistent social impacts of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) by focusing on the relationship between social capital and chronic individual stress and collective trauma, using Hobfolls (1988) conservation of resources model of stress as an organizing framework. Data are based on in-depth personal interviews conducted 14 years after the disaster. Analyses focus on the ways in which stress-related behaviors associated with loss and threat of loss of various forms of resources have affected social capital in the renewable resource community of Cordova, Alaska. Findings reveal lower levels of trust, disruptions in associations, weakened social connections and networks, altered social discourses, diminished feelings of good will, and violations of norms of reciprocity. Behaviors associated with long-term stress related to the EVOS and to the associated protracted litigation are indicative of diminished social capital. This research highlights the critical importance of social capital as a collective resource and illustrates the ways in which decreased social capital can exacerbate individual stress and collective trauma."
0,"According to many radicals, wage labor is the defining characteristic of capitalism. Marx predicted that capitalism would transform the peasantry into wage workers, by abolishing their ties to the land and rendering them “free” to sell their labor-power. Clearly, this linear proletarianization thesis does not help us understand colonial African peasants, very few of whom were dependent on wages as late as the 1940s. In reality, colonial capitalists preferred the cheap costs of  forced labor, and peasants resisted wage labor that threatened their traditional livelihoods. Wallerstein argues that the modern world-system will never achieve full proletarianization because the mix of nonwaged and wage labor is far more profitable for capitalist. Over the longue duree of the modern world-system, far more laborers have been employed in the informal sector, in forms of forced labor, and in debt bondage than in formal wage earning. Indeed, it is these types of semiproletarianization that comprise the defining feature of capitalism. Rather than wage earning, a majority of workers provide nonwaged labors to capitalist commodity chains that, in turn, extract surpluses from them and externalize costs of production to their households."
0,"This project examines the role of family background on the identification of multiracial children in the U.S. and considers the impact of various classificatory schemes on child poverty estimates.  I seek to resolve several questions in this analysis.  First, I consider the extent to which key family background characteristics such as income, education, and race influence patterns of child race reporting (monoracial vs. multiracial) by parents in interracial unions.  I then consider whether child poverty tabulations are sensitive to how and where we include multiracial children in the estimates.

As the second largest military force in NATO, I will examine the implications of Turkeys potential transition from a conscription-based to an AVF in the context of civil-military relations.  I hypothesize that the history of civil-military relations, the ideological emphasis in military training on service as a sacred duty, and the social significance accorded to military service in Turkish society will create a high degree of social and cultural resistance against the implementation of an AVF.  I argue that the particular historical and social contexts of civil-military relations in Turkey have created a perceived incompatibility between military institutionalism and professionalism and will likely play a significant role in shaping the success of a possible transition to an AVF as well as the impact that such a transition will have on civil-military relations."
0,"In this article, using data on traffic volume and fatal accident rates in Israel from 2001 to 2004 a period spanning much of the Second Intifada-we examine the population-level responses to endemic terror to uncover whether societies become habituated so that the response weakens Following repeated attacks or whether they become increasingly sensitized so subsequent attacks have a greater impact. Our analysis, using distributed-lag time series models, supports earlier findings while highlighting the persistence of the response to terror attacks even several years into the violence. There arc, however, signs that the reaction to terror has accelerated. This shift, which is not naturally seen as evidence for either habituation or sensitization, is suggestive of social learning of norms over time."
0,"Much of what we know about strikes is grounded in the context of postwar Fordism, a unique historical moment of relatively institutionalized labor-management relations. Yet the resurgence of corporate resistance over the past quarter century, coupled with an increasingly hostile political and economic climate, has fundamentally transformed the American industrial landscape. Drawing from this research and insights on social movements and formal organizations, we expect unions will vary considerably in their response to threats. Our analysis, based on a comprehensive data set of U. S. strikes from 1984 to 2002, reveals the importance of such intra-movement cleavages for strike activity and for the prospects of organized labor in the contemporary United States. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for scholarship on threat and social movement challenges more generally."
0,"Drawing on the ongoing battles between black churches and the gay community in Washington, DC, this paper examines the ways in which the black church has complicated the relationship between the gay (read as “white”) and the African American communities. As African Americans see the presence of white gays and lesbians in their neighborhood as an omen of their displacement, the black church becomes the vehicle by which blacks mobilize political and economic resources to undermine LGBT political power. Furthermore, the centrality of the black church in the history of black political movements in the United States has, in many ways, has enabled the opinions of black spiritual leaders on gay rights issues to represent the position of the larger African American communities. Finally, I examine the positionality of gay African Americans, who often find themselves navigating between two “mutually exclusive” communities."
0,"While common-sense understandings depict chronic illness as a static condition, changing only when clearly degenerative, biographical osteoarthritis narratives are driven by images and metaphors of movement.  This is especially important when considered in light of Hockey and James argument concerning the relationship between movement metaphors and the aged in Western culture.  Narrative metaphors and images include the movement of pain across body regions, the limitations osteoarthritis places on movement across space and in time, the movement of the consequences of osteoarthritis outwards (to social relations) and inwards (to shape internal thoughts and dialogues), and movement as a moral mandate and evaluative standard. This paper suggests that these metaphors are used to sustain the practicalities of everyday life, social networks, and a moral order based on the necessity of movement and activity."
0,"Researchers analyzed YUM(!) Brand/Kentucky Fried Chicken's (KFC's) response to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA's) KFC cruelty campaign in order to add a new component to the current organizational deviance literature related to how corporations defend themselves against attacks. KFC's reaction to PETA's attempts to label it deviant is a unique pattern of response we dub strategic interaction, in which each tactic used by PETA is met with a new and adaptive response by KFC. After an extensive campaign, PETA was still unable to succeed at changing KFC's policies. We attempt to explain PETA's lack of success in terms of superficial appeasement and appropriation. Superficial appeasement is a newly identified stalling tactic, which may provide organizations with the time they need to create a history of corporate responsibility in response to accusations of deviance. Appropriation involved KFC's co-optation of a joint panel that was intended to facilitate dialogue between the two organizations, but instead became almost entirely filled with panelists sympathetic to KFC's existing corporate policies, a technique that may facilitate other corporations attempting to defend themselves."
0,"This study evaluates the empirical merits of a multilevel model of English language proficiency among immigrants. The model represents a synthesis of Blau's theory of intergroup relations and the human capital model. Hypotheses derived from the model were tested using multilevel ordinal logistic analysis with individual and aggregate data from the 2000 U.S. Census for members of 20 non-English language groups. The results lent strong support to predictions derived from Blau's theory. As expected, immigrants' English proficiency was affected negatively by group size and segregation, and positively by linguistic heterogeneity and inequality between fluent and poor English speakers of foreign origin. In addition, individual factors also exerted significant effects on English fluency as predicted by the human capital model."
0,"Life events have consistently been shown to influence physical illness and mental distress.  To further explicate the processes involved in the association between life events and health, the area of meanings of such events should be explored.  This study uses affect control theory and Holmes social readjustment rating scale to demonstrate that deflection in meanings of life events are correlated with the social readjustment required by them, and thus, are correlated with stress.  Forty-four (44) life events from Holmes social and athletic readjustment rating scale (SARRS) were translated into interpersonal, deflection-producing events.  Life change units were correlated with their mean deflection values.  A Pearsons r of .726 was obtained, suggesting a high association between deflection in meaning and social readjustment.  The implications of this study on stress research are discussed."
0,"Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews, this study compares two job search programs (a volunteer organization geared toward middle-class job seekers and a social service agency geared toward refugees and welfare recipients) in the Twin Cities. I find that the middle class program, espousing a self-marketing model, draws on the discourse of positive thinking and the trope of the economic crisis in order to create the ideally active job seeker.  The social service agency faces bureaucratic and cultural constraints, leading to a hollow discourse of compliance and ideally apathetic clients.  I locate the disjunctions between the prevailing ideologies of each program and the participants’ lived experiences, which open up potential venues for resistance to these programs that ultimately elide structural inequality."
0,"Social contexts in which confidants get to know each other affect the composition of their personal networks, inter alia the similarity among confidants. Results from analyses on a representative sample of the Dutch population between 18 and 65 years of age (SSND 2000), support the idea that differences in similarity among confidants can be explained by 1.) the social composition of a context, 2.) the extent to which interactions within a context are enforced, and 3.) the amount of time people spend in a context. Moreover, there is a certain degree of path-dependency in the use of social contexts, that leads to reinforced context effects on similarity among confidants."
0,"Primordialist and constructivist authors have debated the nature of ethnicity ""as such"" and therefore failed to explain why its characteristics vary so dramatically across cases, displaying different degrees of social closure, political salience, cultural distinctiveness, and historical stability. The author introduces a multilevel process theory to understand how these characteristics are generated and transformed over time. The theory assumes that ethnic boundaries are the outcome of the classificatory struggles and negotiations between actors situated in a social field. Three characteristics of a field - the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries. The nature of this consensus explains the particular characteristics of an ethnic boundary. A final section identifies endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of change."
0,"Housing represents an important arena within which racial inequalities continue to manifest-a fact highlighted in housing audit studies and the substantial literature on racial residential segregation. In this article, we extend the insights of prior work by: (1) denoting the wide range of ""exclusionary"" discriminatory practices that transpire at distinct stages of the rental/sales process and that are too varied to be captured by any singular audit design; (2) analyzing something that audits simply cannot, namely discrimination that occurs within already established housing arrangements (i.e., nonexclusionary discrimination). We draw from qualitative and quantitative data truly unique to the literature, reflecting approximately 750 instances of housing discrimination discrimination verified by civil rights investigators following state and federal guidelines. Quantitative patterns denote unique and disparate vulnerability, especially for African American women, and the centrality of powerful institutional (i.e., banks, realtors, insurance companies, etc.) and more proximate actors (i.e., landlords and neighbors) in reifying racial disadvantage. Landlords are clearly on the ""front line"" with regard to both exclusionary and nonexclusionary forms. Neighbors, realtors, banks, and mortgage companies play a role as well, more or less, depending on the form of discrimination being examined. Qualitative immersion into case materials offers important insight on relevant processes pertaining to victim vulnerability and status, and how discriminatory actions themselves occur. We conclude by discussing the implications of our arguments and findings for future analyses of race and housing inequality, and for understanding stratification and its microinteractional dimensions generally."

0,"This analysis extends prior research on labor market conditions and violent crime. Specifically, we elaborate on research demonstrating a link between poor labor market conditions and violence by directly measuring the associations between secondary sector work, low hour work, low pay work, and levels of violence across the metro-non metro divide. The results demonstrate that low paying work tends to be more similar to other forms of social disadvantage such as poverty and unemployment. In contrast, secondary sector work and low hour work are empirically distinct constructs. Consistent with prior research, multivariate analyses indicate that the pernicious effect of secondary sector work is relatively constant across metro and nonmetro areas. However, contrary to the logic articulated in previous studies, we find that an index of low hour and seasonal employment is actually associated with lower violent crime rates across the metro-nonmetro divide. This finding is consonant with the assertion that the availability of low hour and seasonal employment-work that is often viewed as less than optimal-provides downward pressure on crime rates because it structures ecological behavior patterns and enhances attachments to institutions Cultivating conventional behavior.

0,"Affirmative action remains alive in American society, but the arguments used to justify it have changed dramatically.  Initially, affirmative action was said to be a needed for a nation attempting to rectify historical discrimination and racial and economic inequality. Today, it is increasingly defended on grounds that diversity is an essential qualification for success in a variety of fields, including law enforcement and business.  We examine the development of this shift, and focus on the disjuncture between widespread employment practices and the law, which is now playing catch-up.  We examine this instrumental form of affirmative action in the hiring of police officers and business decision-making.  We show that though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow for race-based hiring when race is thought to be a bona fide occupational qualification, courts are finding ways around this limitation.  We conclude with a warning that this shift signals both new opportunities for minority hiring but also limitations on opportunity."
0,"This study of the relation of economic decline to mortality in the 50 upstate New York counties is guided by an ecological framework that sees communities depending on their social organization, including medical services, for maintaining and improving the well-being of residents to defend against external problems/threats.  The study uses a factor score of economic decline and shows that it predicts age-adjusted mortality, controlling on physicians per capita and housing costs.  A weak test supports the hypothesized interaction of Decline and weak structure.  The study moves on to answer the ""how"" question by introducing an alternative mechanism for linking Decline to death.  In contrast to the accepted biomedical model that turns on a weakened immune system, it claims that disrupted health habits produce malaise and/or the sharp reaction of stress that may follow unemployment.  What is suggested is parallel explanations of different components of population health: disruption leading to lowered vitality and a weakened immune system producing sickness and then death."
0,"The relationship between humans and the animals they raise for food has typically been characterized as utilitarian.  However, recent work examining human-nonhuman animal interaction provides evidence that this is not the complete story. Using ethnographic data, this research reveals the utilitarian perspective to be overly simplistic by showing that owners of cow/calf operations develop emotional ties to the animals they raise. This emotional attachment must then be managed in order to maintain the economic viability of each ranch. Drawing on research on human-animal interaction and emotion management, this paper shows that ranchers develop an institutional self in an effort to negotiate their contradictory experience of animals. In essence, cattle ranching represents a form of dirty work that maintains the animal-human boundary."

In doing this, the authors address several gaps in the environmental sociology literature.  They also provide strong support for Downey's ""Inequality, Democracy, and Environment"" model (the IDE model) by (a) demonstrating the important role that armed violence and other overlapping elite-controlled mechanisms play in promoting environmental, social, and human degradation, (b) illustrating the centrality of armed violence to one of the World Bank's core missions, and (c)setting forth evidence that confirms five of Downey's six IDE hypotheses."

0,"This paper analyzes strategies used by women in a collegiate, male-defined sport (rugby) to deal with identity dilemmas. Players challenged conventional notions of passive femininity through tough play, yet encountered sexist and homophobic stigma from outsiders. Rather than resisting and rejecting the power of this stigma, they engaged in defensive othering-subordinates distancing themselves from other subordinates and reinforcing the legitimacy of a devalued identity in the process. Specifically, the women identified with dominants, engaged in normative identification, and propped up dominants. Their identity work resulted in a ""heterosexy-fit"" identity that ultimately reinforced heterosexism and gender inequality."
0,"While most studies of urban nightlife focus on patrons, this analysis focuses on the employees of the nightclub industry. This articles draws on over five years of experience in and two years of ethnographic research at Narcisse: a restaurant/club/lounge which is both unique and yet representative of the nightlife industry of Chicago. This study draws out the temporal peculiarities of the occupation, the specific occupational orientation - one that defies traditional occupational logic by emphasizing the greater importance of symbolic and social capital rather than economic compensation, and finally how traditional occupational status and hierarchies neglect how certain jobs have particular status within a particular idioculture as opposed to the dominant culture. In doing so, this study offers insight into urban sociology by exploring the internal workings of the post-industrial hybrid of the service economy and the culture industry generalized herein as the leisure industry, and how specific occupations and occupational roles are always embedded in larger cultural frameworks."
0,"Scholars writing on occupations and organizations offer varied neomarxist, criminological and organizational culture approaches for analyzing deception in the workplace.  While these approaches are all valuable, I argue that they are also incomplete in neglecting to appreciate deception simply as a basic element in daily working life. The neomarxist schools of thought view deception primarily as a tactic of exploitation or resistance.  The criminologists and business ethicists see deception only as a reflection of corruption and criminal technique.  The organizational culturists, although avoiding the overly narrow lenses of the other approaches, offer no general theoretical explanations for why deceptions occur not just in some workplace domains (such as negotiating or sales), or within some professions and not others, but across so many overlapping aspects of everyday work.  To analyze deception as normative in working life, I adopt Erving Goffmans dramaturgical approach, which offers a pre-existing framework for understanding deceptions importance in maintaining social order in routine interactions.  My resulting conceptualization of the dramaturgical infrastructure of the workplace offers a framework for deceptive acts in categories of credibility management, ethical disengagement, shadow administration and of managing identity and role conflicts.  Workers, who offer false shows of deference to superiors, exaggerate resume credentials, hide safety violations, craft misleading accounting reports, goof off, and make false claims to customers constitute some of these recognizable practitioners of workplace deception.  I conclude by identifying some ways that deception helps people to navigate workplace demands and by suggesting an agenda for further developing a sociology of workplace deception."
0,"Whether to remember or forget is a central concern of societies confronting violent pasts. While the literature on cultural trauma suggests that commemoration fosters solidarity (Alexander 2004, 2007; Eyerman 2004; Geisen 2004), the literature on commemoration suggests that commemoration may be divisive (Wagner-Pacifici and Schwartz 1991; Vinitzky-Seroussi 2002, 2010). This paper explores this contradiction though an in-depth case study the 40th anniversary commemoration of the “Mississippi Burning” murders. Based on participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival research, I identify four “registers of repair” and examine how discourses of repair and disrepair emerge out of the same event. I argue that commemoration is neither inherently reparative nor disreparative, but rather, we must think of repair as variable across registers (interpersonal, political, legal, and economic)."
0,"The role of companies in organizing social life has long been a controversial topic since. It called more attention since the emergence of the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) which has seen notable rise since it emerged in the West in the 1950s. However, studies on CSR are done mostly from the companies’ perspectives, implying that CSR is a strategic management tool for companies to gain profit (Godfrey Merrill, and Hansen 2009). CSR, as a bridge between a company’s economic activities and its social impact, has not been discussed from the perspective of the society. The analysis of companies’ CSR initiatives and their influence on cultivating community is, at present, underdeveloped. In this article, I investigate CSR initiatives by analyzing the role of companies in cultivating communities’ social capital, the importance of which has raised across multiple social science disciplines. A major aspect that companies are focusing on when making CSR decisions is to community engagement. Main activities for this particular kind of engagement are to help in teaming up with voluntary associations and informal organizations, which is, according to Putnam (2000), one of the key indicators of the level of social capital. Furthermore, I argue that companies’ sizes is another factor that shouldn’t be neglected in measuring the companies influence on social capital at community level given the unique characteristics of SMEs. Therefore, in this article, I intend to examine companies’ contribution to communities’ social capital taking into consideration of their firm sizes."

0,"The expansion of women's political representation ranks among the most significant trends in American politics of the last 100 years. In this paper, we develop two longitudinal theories to explain patterns of growth and change in women's state legislative representation over time. Gender salience suggests that years in which women's absence from politics is problematized (e.g., 1992-the Year of the Woman) will demonstrate higher levels of growth. Political climate suggests that periods in which domestic issues are stressed (e.g., the 1990s) will produce higher levels of growth than periods in which international issues are stressed (e.g., post 9/11). Combinations of these two theories create four possible trajectories of growth in women's representation that may be observed over time. We use latent growth curve models to assess the four theoretical trajectories, using data on women's state legislative representation from 1982 to 2006. We find that while women achieved fleeting success in the Year of the Woman, further gains were limited in the remainder of the 1990s and average growth stalled completely after 2001. Our results show futher that gender salience and, to a lesser extent political, climate matter to growth and change in women's political power over time. "
0,"This research reports results of open-ended surveys designed to obtain in-depth qualitative data and anecdotal accounts of gender inequalities and perceptions of inequalities at the University of Texas at San Antonio.  We use the results of these surveys to clarify whether or not common issues in the literature, and previous issues raised in the UT System, remain serious problems for women faculty at UTSA.    Evidence of perceptions by women that they need to do more to accomplish the same merit, evidence of perceptions about increased service commitments required of women, evidence of perceptions about unsupportive supervisors, and evidence of perceptions that women are disconnected from and devalued by their colleagues, and get less respect than their male counterparts, all indicate that women faculty members at UTSA experience the chilly climate."
0,"Studies have examined the mental, physical, and psychosocial outcomes of adult children whose mother was depressed during their childhood, including mental illness, substance abuse, incarceration, life satisfaction, and social functioning. In studies of self-mastery, findings have been somewhat inconclusive. This longitudinal study explored the self-mastery outcomes of adult children whose mothers were depressed during their childhoods, and mothers with long-term depression.  This study uses a subsample from the National Survey of Family and Household (Wave I, 1986-87 and Wave III, 2001-03).  The sample included mothers and one adult child age 18-34 from each participant.  The results indicate that children with mothers who were depressed at Wave I and at both Wave I and Wave III experienced lower self-mastery (p<.01) The results are discussed with reference to study limitations and calls for future research regarding the ways in which social support can help with early intervention for mothers with depression and their children."
0,"Research suggests that community-level poverty is associated with access to health care net of individual-level characteristics, but no research investigates whether this association differs by individual-level income. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, the US. Census Bureau and the Health Resource and Services Administration, I find that the negative relationship between the prevalence of poverty in communities and access to health care is much stronger for middle- and high-income individuals than for those in lower-income groups. I suggest that individuals may benefit from living among those in similar economic circumstances because they face similar obstacles to obtaining medical are. For poor individuals, the collective knowledge and experience embedded in poor communities may compensate for the otherwise negative influence of community-level poverty."

The first measure shows the extent to which a few songs dominate the playlist. The second shows how much the station's playlist overlaps with other stations across the country in the same format. The results show that the larger the station's owner, the less diverse its play, both internally and relative to its peers."
0,"This article examines the interplay of culture, cognition, and social networks in organizations with norms that emphasize cross-boundary collaboration. In such settings, social desirability concerns can induce a disparity between how people view themselves in conscious (i.e., deliberative) versus less conscious (i.e., automatic) cognition. These differences have implications for the resulting pattern of intra-organizational collaborative ties. Based on a laboratory study and field data from a biotechnology firm, we find that (1) people consciously report more positive views of themselves as collaborative actors than they appear to hold in less conscious cognition; (2) less conscious collaborative-independent self-views are associated with the choice to enlist organizationally distant colleagues in collaboration; and (3) these self-views are also associated with a person's likelihood of being successfully enlisted by organizationally distant colleagues (i.e., of supporting these colleagues in collaboration). By contrast, consciously reported collaborative-independent self-views are not associated with these choices. This study contributes to our understanding of how culture is internalized in individual cognition and how self-related cognition is linked to social structure through collaboration. It also demonstrates the limits of self-reports in settings with strong normative pressures and represents a novel integration of methods from cognitive psychology and network analysis."
0,"Persons who are relatively younger have a comparably higher incidence of crime victimization than those who are older. Comparative studies of crime rates among those 65 and older with those for younger persons across time are virtually nonexistent. This study provides these analyses. Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey are used to study the relative victimization rate among US elders. Macroeconomic indicators and environmental interventions were included to examine whether structural forces influence elder crime victimization rates. Such influences are fractionally cointegrated with the long-term elder property and personal crime rates, with each having a distinct data-generating process. The results of these analyses suggest that personal, but not property, crime rates have declined since the passage of the Crime Bill of 1994. As well, the summer months are associated with elevated rates of property crime committed against elders but not personal crime. "
0,"This study investigates the changing racial diversity and structure of metropolitan neighborhoods. We consider three alternative perspectives about localized racial change: that neighborhoods are bifurcating along a white/nonwhite color line, fragmenting into homogeneous enclaves, or integrating white, black, Latino, and Asian residents into diverse residential environments. To assess hypotheses drawn from these perspectives, we develop a hybrid methodology (incorporating the entropy index and majority-rule criteria) that offers advantages over previous typological efforts. Our analysis of 1990-2000 census tract data for the 100 largest US metropolitan areas finds that most neighborhoods are becoming more diverse and that members of all groups have experienced increasing exposure to neighborhood diversity. However, white populations tend to diminish rapidly in the presence of multiple minority groups and there has been concomitant white growth in low-diversity neighborhoods. Latino population dynamics have emerged as a primary force driving neighborhood change in a multi-group context. "
0,"Politics is arguably the arena in which gender inequality remains most pronounced. Yet in recent decades, women in some countries and regions of the world have made significant gains in legislative presence at the national level. But for women living outside of the industrialized West, we know little about the processes that facilitate their entry into politics. Through separate analyses of 36 high-income, 86 middle-income, and 63 low-income countries, I demonstrate that past models of women's political representation fail to explain variation across low-income samples. Using multiple methods, I also explore two sets of factors that may be more salient predictors of women's parliamentary representation in low-income nations: civil war and international linkages. Although historically women have been unable to consolidate gains made during wartime into post-conflict political representation, I find that certain types of civil conflict during the 1980s and 1990s positively affect women's representation in low-income nations. Longer, larger-scale wars that contest the political system or serve to alter the composition of the government have the best prospects for creating opportunities for women to gain parliamentary seats. Brief case studies of women, war, and social change in Rwanda, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tajikistan suggest that structural and cultural mechanisms may work in conjunction with political openings to produce post-conflict gains in women's political presence. Both women's lack of political representation and the tragic effects of civil war remain enduring challenges faced by the developing world, but at the intersection of these two problems, there is hope for women seeking political access."

0,"Despite the constant media coverage on the violence that has besieged Ciudad Juarez, the city remains vibrant.  Life does go on for the more than 1.2 million residents of Ciudad Juarez.  El Paso, Texas faces Juarez, Mexico from across a dry river, through a steel-weaved fencing. As a native of El Paso, the context of the city that I considered my backyard as a child has without a doubt changed.  Yet despite the social upheaval portrayed in the media, the urban space that lies on the edge of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez continues to ebb and flow yet remains worlds apart.  My proposed presentation is an in-depth look at one man’s transnational strategies and street hustle as he navigates between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso creating transnational capital that can be observed and lived out on the streets of Ciudad Juarez and downtown El Paso. The transnational street hustle, as I use it, is not reducible to anti-social maneuvering in the streets to create monetary gain.  In fact the street hustle that can be observed and lived out on the streets of Ciudad Juarez and downtown El Paso is more often just another trade rather than a desperate outcry from the social inequalities underlying the need to create one’s own employment.  My research stems from more than ten years of maintaining a relationship with this key informant as he has navigated and lived the life of a transnational border crosser."
0,"Names often indicate belonging to a certain ethnic group. When immigrant parents choose a first name for their child that is common in their host society, they show a high degree of acculturation. In contrast, selecting a name common only in the parents' country of origin indicates ethnic maintenance. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: the cultural boundary between the country of origin and the host society, the parents' sociostructural integration in terms of education and citizenship, interethnic networks, and religious affiliation."
0,"What do recent trends toward increasingly ambitious educational expectations and rising college completion rates mean for the stratification of higher education? This article shows that the odds of achieving expectations for a bachelor's degree increased across 15 cohorts of young adults, and to a lesser extent, for expectations to attend graduate/professional school. Gender-related constraints on realizing expectations for a bachelor's degree weakened, while constraints associated with minority racial/ethnic and lower socioeconomic statuses did not. Recent trends in educational stratification were thus a mixture of fulfilled expectations for growing proportions of some young adults, but continued social constraints for many others. Note, these results are derived from the experiences of high school seniors successfully reinterviewed over time, who are advantaged relative to school dropouts and nonrespondents."
0,"This paper examines weight gain among young women aged 19-25, focusing on the role of motherhood in becoming overweight and obese.  Using the Waves 1 (1995) and 3 (2001-2002) of the National Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I construct the Body Mass Index (BMI) to gauge whether young women became overweight or obese between waves.  There are few differences in the proportion overweight or obese at the first wave, when the women were aged 12-18 (approximately 16% overweight and 10% obese), but the proportions increase and diverge by motherhood status by the third wave.  Overall, 22% and 25.5% of all young women are overweight and obese by 2001-2002, respectively, but of young mothers, 26% are overweight and 34% are obese.  Excluding those whose weight remained stable or already had a child by the first wave, those who had a child between waves are significantly more likely to become overweight or obese.  Additionally, public assistance emerges as an important predictor of overweight.  These findings have implications for the health of the women, their children, and future pregnancies."
0,"Religion has a powerful influence on learning and development, and this provides an important cultural foundation for stratification processes. Findings from prior studies of the connection between religion and educational attainment are mixed, but most studies point to negative effects of sectarian Protestant affiliation and fundamentalist beliefs in the inerrancy of sacred texts on educational attainment, aspirations, occupational attainment, and wealth. Verbal ability provides an important potential mechanism through with conservative religion anchors stratification outcomes. I examine the impact of religious affiliation, religious participation, and beliefs in the inerrancy of the Bible on verbal ability. Using data from the 1984-2006 General Social Surveys, I find that both inerrantist beliefs and sectarian affiliations have substantial negative effects on verbal ability. Religious participation has a modest positive effect on verbal ability, but its influence is mostly confined to sectarian Protestants and biblical inerrantists. Importantly, the positive effect of age on verbal ability is substantially weaker among sectarians and biblical inerrantists, suggesting that their closed social networks hinder learning throughout the lifecourse.

0,"The prevalence of autism has increased precipitously-roughly 10-fold in the past 40 years-yet no one knows exactly what caused this dramatic rise. Using a large and representative dataset that spans the California birth cohorts from 1992 through 2000, we examine individual and community resources associated with the likelihood of an autism diagnosis over time. This allows us to identify key social factors that have contributed to increased autism prevalence. While individual-level factors, such as birth weight and parental education, have had a fairly constant effect on likelihood of diagnosis over time, we find that community-level resources drive increased prevalence. This study suggests that neighborhoods dynamically interact with the people living in them in different ways at different times to shape health outcomes. By treating neighborhoods as dynamic, we can better understand the changing socioeconomic gradient of autism and the increase in prevalence."
0,"For Japanese Americans, the significance of race has been noted to have declined, gradually and signifincatly, to the point that their economic status is currently similar to that of non-Hispanic whites.  Yet Japanese Americans have also experienced a long history of exclusion in the U.S. that needs to be reconciled with this view.  To reconcile the contrasting views, we track the social integration level of persons of Japanese descent by estimating Japanese American-white American homogamy relative to intermarriage levels during the WWII and  resettlement periods using Census PUMS files.  Here, we are interested in examining the upward bias in the level of intermarriage due to veteran brides--servicemen sent to another country, such as Japan, have few white women to select from as mates and hence are in an entirely different set of options.  We find that: a) the level of homogamy as opposed to intermarriage is substantially higher among veterans than nonveterans during the resettlement (1946-1961) and post-civil rights (1962-1980) involving Japanese brides; b) the majority of  these wives were naturalized after age 50; and c) a substantial gender asymmetry in intermarriage patterns emerged after the resettlement period, especially among vetrans; and d) revised estimates of the homogamy level of the resettlement cohort is 3 times higher when removing veterans who marry Japanese wives from the sample.  These findings suggest that the service persons intermarriage patterns have contributed to the substantial underestimation in the level of homogamy of Japanese Americans since WWII."
0,"Longstanding methods to depict the participation levels of under-represented students in math, science and engineering fields remain incomplete.  To remedy this, our study examines the horizontal segregation by gender, race and ethnicity of students in U.S. universities.  We employ the index of dissimilarity to examine racial and gender segregation within science fields.  We also examine representation at institutions of varying levels of selectivity.  By considering multiple dimensions of participation, our findings uncover a greater level of complexity in the representation of women and minorities in science fields."
0,"Ethnic and racial communities occupy symbolic and geographic spaces in which conflicting racial images are created and imbued with political, economic, and moral meaning by a wide range of interests, including those of developers, the media, city officials, and members of ethnic communities. To examine this issue, I compare two cases in the economic redevelopment of downtown San Diego.  In one case, the Chinese Mission building, originally built in 1927 was saved and turned into a museum and cultural center.  In the other, the Douglas Hotel, constructed in 1924 and the center of entertainment for African Americans until the post-WWII era, was demolished by the city to make way for a multi-use commercial and residential complex.  In the history of urban areas in the U.S., images of ethnic communities have had real, material consequences as local governments have strategically employed these images to justify development plans.  For example, city officials have declared neighborhoods as ""blighted,"" ""slums,"" and ""dens of depravity"" to justify displacing residents and businesses through urban redevelopment projects, or, as vital economic enclaves and sites of ""exotic"" activities to cultivate them as tourist attractions.  I examine this process in my comparison of the two sites."
0,"In this paper, I utilize a variant of Breuillys definition of nationalism to examine how one branch of the White Supremacist MovementWhite Aryan Resistance (WAR)talks about nationalism and the related question of who comprises the nation.  I use qualitative analysis, relying on content and especially discourse analysis to compare issues of WAR newsletters from the six months before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks to six issues after the attacks.  While I expected that references to nationalism and negative references to the government, Jews, and Arabs would increase following the attacks as a result of an opportunity for increased resonance, I find only partial support for this.  Instead, I discover that the White Supremacist Movements conception of the United States as a nation is different from that of most Americans.  Familiar targets of racismBlacks and Jewsremain preferred targets for negative speech, even at the expense of potentially increased recruitment."
0,"We draw on conversation analytic methods and research to explicate the interactional phenomenon of requesting in general and the specific case of requesting participation in survey interviews. Recent work on survey participation gives much attention to leverage-saliency theory but does not explore how the key concepts of this theory are exhibited in the actual unfolding interaction of interviewers and potential respondents. We examine interaction using digitally recorded and transcribed calls to recruit participation in the 2004 Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. We describe how potential respondents present interactional environments that are relatively discouraging or encouraging, and how, in response, interviewers may be relatively cautious or presumptive in their requesting actions. We consider how interviewers' ability to tailor their behavior to their interactional environments can affect whether an introduction reaches the point at which a request to participate is made, the form that this request takes, and the sample person's response. This article contributes to understanding the social action of requesting and specifically how we might use insights from analyses of interaction to increase cooperation with requests to participate in surveys."
0,"This study explores how racial composition, in-migration and community identity influence the distribution Of antiblack and antiwhite hate crimes. Drawing on six years of Chicago Police Department reports, two decades of census data and community survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the paper evaluates hypotheses derived from racial threat, macrostructural opportunity and defended community perspectives. Negative binomial models controlling for spatial dependence reveal different patterns for antiblack and antiwhite hate crimes across Chicago communities. Consistent with a defended communities model, antiblack hate crimes are most common in homogenous white communities with strong community identities undergoing recent black in-migration. In contrast, antiwhite hate crimes are most numerous in communities where blacks and whites comprise near equal proportions, supporting macrostructural opportunity perspectives."
0,"This article engages with problems that are usually opaque: What trajectories do scientific debates assume, when does a scientific community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that? We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en route to consensus."

0,This study stems from attempting to operationalize income inequality in predicting health outcomes at the cross-national level.  The Gini Coefficient has long been used as a population based measure to indicate relative income inequality for the entire unit of analysis.  A new trigonometric measure is suggested to further dissect population specific ownership of income without separating population brackets into dummy variables.  The new method suggests isolating clustered inflection points on the Lorenz curve and comparing radians across populations.
0,"We use hierarchical cross-classified random-effects models to simultaneously measure age, period, and cohort patterns of mortality risk between 1986 and 2006 for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black men and women with less than a high school education, a high school education, and more than a high school education. We examine all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease, lung cancer, and unpreventable cancers. Findings reveal that temporal reductions in black and white men's and women's mortality rates were driven entirely by cohort changes in mortality. Findings also demonstrate that disparate cohort effects between education groups widened the education gap in all-cause mortality risk and mortality risk from heart disease and lung cancer across this time period. Educational disparities in mortality risk from unpreventable cancers, however, did not change. This research uncovers widening educational differences in adult mortality and demonstrates that a cohort perspective provides valuable insights for understanding recent temporal changes in U.S. mortality risk."
0,"Transitivity and structural balance are fundamental properties of social networks.  Characterized best by axioms such as an enemy of an enemy is a friend or the friend of a friend is a friend, transitivity implies that individuals who like each other will also share similar evaluations of other actors, situations, or relations.  Empirically, though, do such rules apply to negative interactions such as murder?  That is, in the case of murder will the relations and allies of the victim or offender be motivated to come to their mutual aid?  In this essay, I combine quantitative and qualitative data to test the transitivity principle in the context of gang homicide.  Chicago gangs possess intricate patterns of alliance that coincide with the principle of transitivity, normatively requiring that certain groups coalesce against common rivals.  Findings suggest that at the dyad level, such precepts seem to hold as much of gang homicide is reciprocal in nature.  When extended to alliances between multiple gangs, however, transitivity does not always hold.  While transitive homicidal patterns occur at a higher frequency than most other patterns of interaction, they do not do so more than randomly expected.  Mutual avoidance or ""each gang for themsleves"" more aptly fit multilpe gang violence."
0,"Although sociologists have identified education as likely determinant of migration, the ways in which education affects migration are unclear and empirical results are disparate. This paper addresses the relationship between educational attainment, enrolment, and migration, focusing on the role of gender and how it changes with evolving social contexts. Using empirical analyses based in Nepal, results indicate that educational attainment has positive effects and enrolment has negative effects on out-migration and including enrolment in the model increases the effect of attainment. In the case of women, with the changing role of gender, increased education and labor force participation, the affect of educational attainment changes drastically over time, from almost no effect, to a strong positive effect. Consideration of enrolment, and the role of gender in education, employment, and marriage may help to explain the disparate results in past research on education and migration. "
0,"Mens economic status within the household is a well-known factor that shapes their masculine identity and their attitudes about how men and women should behave. Unlike previous studies of this phenomenon, this paper investigates how the association between mens breadwinning status and their gender attitudes is influenced by macro economic institutional arrangements. The authors theorize and empirically test a novel proposition that the effect of mens breadwinning status on their gender beliefs is mediated by the various institutional arrangements found in different types of labor markets. They argue that the institutional arrangements characteristic of rigid labor markets versus flexible labor markets provide men with different opportunities to experience a non-traditional gender arrangement in the household, which in turn shapes their gender beliefs. Rigid labor market structures endorse the traditional male-breadwinner female-homemaker arrangement, and contribute to mens ability maintain a long-term breadwinning status. By contrast, flexible labor markets are less gendered and provide men with more frequent opportunities to experience non-traditional arrangements. Thus, the fluctuations of mens economic status in a flexible labor market prevent men from perceiving a loss of breadwinning ability, even if they do not earn the larger share of family wage. For this reason, the authors hypothesize that the importance of breadwinner status in determining mens gender attitudes will be stronger in more rigid labor markets. The authors provide evidence for this hypothesis by applying multilevel models to data drawn from the 2002 International Social Survey Program and World Banks International Finance Corporation Doing Business database."
0,"In this research I analyze how, during legal segregation, white-generated fear was used to keep African Americans under control and how that fear motivated coping strategies used to survive onslaughts of blatant racism.  Drawing on fifty in-depth interviews from a snowball sample in a southern state, and using an iterative content analysis, I detail the views, understandings, and experiences of older African Americans (aged 50-89).  The respondents health and bodies are still affected by the white-induced state of fear.  Their deep fear of racist actions increases the likelihood of racialized pain being transported across later generations.  As they attempt to heal wounds stemming from still operative cycles of victimization and resistance, they pass fears and coping strategies to descendants.  White-generated trauma is evident today as they recall the terror-filled events and KKK-type symbols of an era they long to forget but dare not.  To alleviate the affects on the minds and health of African Americans, the racial traumas must first be fully acknowledged by black communities and the larger society."
0,"This essay examines various types of social support in contemporary society and then applies the knowledge to bereaved individuals.  The value of social support gained through both informal and formal networks is seen as critical to ones overall health and well being, especially when significant loss is experienced.  The role of modernity in shaping social support is discussed here and analyzed as we shift from modern to post modern society.  Lastly, communities of support such as mutual help groups and self help groups are compared in general and then as they apply to bereavement."
0,"Miami-Dade County, in South Florida, has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the United States.  Though much research has been done to reveal the causes of homelessness in the county, little has been completed to show what I believe is the main cause:  gentrification.  This paper analyzes the true effects that gentrification has had on Miami-Dade in the past five years and the consequences it has inflicted on the poorest individuals in this county.  While “community cohesion” has been a goal for city officials, gentrification seems to causing more destruction to the citizens that need the most governmental help and support."
0,"This research addresses the influences of West African cultures on a rarely studied area: marching cadences of the United States military. This article details the evolution of these military marching cadences tracing their form back to slave songs and to the music of precolonial West Africa. Six elements are identified that link these forms of music. These are: call and response, focus on the voice, percussion backbeat to create energy, functionality in nature, focus on the experiences of daily living, and oral history. These suggest a great influence of West African music on the United States military marching cadences."
0,"Political parties have largely disappeared from the agenda of historical sociology. The discipline tends to oscillate between state and society centered approaches neither of which adequately explain or grasp their significance. This essay introduces the concept of political society, understood as a social formation developing around the distribution of the means of interest representation. We use this concept to explain both the rise of mass parties, and the stabilization of capitalist democracy. We argue that capitalist democracies have been more stable to the extent that the means of interest representation are concentrated in the hands of a political class. Where in contrast the means of interest representation are dispersed, as in direct democracy, or controlled by a status group, as in rule by notables, capitalist democracy has tended to be unstable. To make this argument we compare the political evolution of France, Italy and India. In each case we show that stabilization depended on the formation of a political class, which controls the means of interest representation. Thus capitalist democracy is based on the expropriation of the means of interest representation from the mass of the population."
0,"Almost half of first marriages end in divorce, which in turn may produce joint physical custody arrangements. Seen by many states to be in the best interest of the child, joint physical custody is increasingly common. Yet much is unknown about its consequences for children. This article considers how joint physical custody arrangements affect children's neighborhood friendships, an important component of child well-being because of their contributions to social and cognitive development. Thirteen parents and 17 children (aged 5-11) in 10 families, selected via convenience and snowball sampling, participated in semistructured interviews. The findings suggest that joint physical custody arrangements do not imperil children's neighborhood friendships; indeed, most children and parents interviewed voiced contentment in this area."
0,"Several recent studies across the social sciences show that the spatial agglomeration of employment in a local labor market benefits both firms and workers in terms of better firm performance and higher wages. Drawing from the organizational ecology perspective, we argue that workers receive higher wages in large industrial clusters and urban labor markets because of the greater degree of organizational diversity relative to smaller local industries and labor markets. Using data from the 1990 PUMS-L, we employ a three-level hierarchical linear model in order to test hypotheses regarding organizational diversity and the effects of industrial and urban agglomeration on wages. We find that workers benefit from both forms of agglomeration due to greater establishment size and industrial diversity in large industrial clusters and urban labor markets. We also find that urban agglomeration has a larger substantive effect on wages than industrial agglomeration in reduced models, but the industrial agglomeration effect is more robust across models. These findings support the organizational ecology perspective, which suggests that workers earn higher wages in local industry clusters and urban labor markets because greater organizational diversity leads to more optimal matching between workers and employers. However, the wage premium associated with urban labor markets is also due to other factors, such as greater levels of human capital and higher rates of union density."
0,"Studies have shown that intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with poor mental health. But, does women's, and specifically mother's, mental health improve after leaving a union marked by IPV? We used two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (n = 2610) to examine the association between IPV as measured by controlling and violent behaviors, and maternal mental health and union dissolution. Mothers in unions marked by IPV reported poorer mental health, became more depressed and maintained high levels of anxiety over time regardless of whether or not their union dissolved, compared to mothers who were in non-abusive unions. Mothers in stable non-abusive unions became more depressed over time, but at a lower magnitude than mothers in controlling and violent unions. Mothers in non-abusive unions that dissolved also became more depressed and anxious over time. Overall, we find that women are still at risk for mental health problems even after leaving IPV unions.

0,"Southern and non-Southern labor markets entered the period of economic restructuring from different starting points. Industrial and occupational differences across regions were eroded by the growth of the service industry in all regions, the decline in personal services within the South, and the decline of unions and manufacturing jobs outside of the South. This analysis underscores that indicators of precarity such as unionization and part-time jobs are really at the core of understanding regional low-wage earnings convergence. Furthermore, the authors find that an interaction between the regional structure of occupational opportunities and the racial and gender makeup of workers in jobs, particularly black women, plays an important role in producing the sharp low-wage earnings growth observed in the South in the 1970s and 1980s."
0,"Parents' educational attainment is generally completed before offspring are born. Thus, there is little opportunity to study the ways in which children's observation of their parents' pursuit of education may augment the effects of structural factors on intergenerational transmission processes. In this article, the authors use qualitative and quantitative data collected from thirty-five women across a decade following their return to school to examine the effects of children's observations of their mothers' educational achievements on the children's educational aspirations and achievements in adulthood. The return to school was consequential only when mothers completed their degrees; when they did not, their enrollment appears to have had little or no effect on children's educational achievements. Mothers' completion of college was found to be the most important for children's educational outcomes when fathers were less educated and opposed to mothers' enrollment and when the return to school was fueled by personal and psychological, rather than career, motivations."
0,"This paper addresses the issue of how special collective ritual events operate and influence actors&#8217; emotional states and commitment to a group.  It is argued that in such events (e.g, rallies, holidays celebrations, religious ceremonies) the greater the emotional intensity experienced by persons, the greater will be their commitment to and solidarity within the group.  A model is proposed which identifies several factors involved in such a process.  The model builds upon a body of theory and research &#8220;structural ritualization theory,&#8221; which focuses on the role symbolic rituals play in social life and the generation and transformation of social structure.  Four factors play a crucial role in the model: focus of attention, interactional pace, interdependence, and resources.  Several of these factors also involve subcomponents that are identified and discussed.  Attention is directed to how the formulation presented here is influenced by, and differs in certain ways from, classic and contemporary analysts including those working in the areas of social psychology and the sociology of emotions.  Various examples are provided to illustrate the ability of the model to understand collective ritual events.  Directions for further theory development and possible research investigating the arguments of the theory are also discussed."
0,"In the early to mid-2000s, four flagship Israeli selective universities incorporated a need-blind and color-blind affirmative action policy into their admissions practices. The program, which gives an edge in admission to academically borderline applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds, emphasizes structural disadvantages, such as neighborhood socioeconomic status and high school rigor. The results of this study, based on administrative data from the four universities, demonstrate that having such a policy in place made the four institutions, especially the echelons at the most selective departments, more diverse than they otherwise would have been. The rise in geographic, economic and demographic diversity of a student population suggests that the plan's focus on structural determinants of disadvantage yields broad diversity dividends. The paper discusses the relevance of the findings to the ongoing discussion of admission regimes, diversity and equality of opportunity in the US. "
0,"Despite the fact that education now stands at the center of political rhetoric favoring a new, opportunity-centric kind of welfare state, comparative welfare analysis has yet to fully incorporate education into its research agenda.  Education made appearances in some early analyses of the welfare state, but only recently has it truly gained the spotlightand, still, without drawing much from the sociology of education.  Meanwhile, education became the political centerpiece of the many third way reform programs in the 1990s, and investment in skills is now regularly highlighted by international political elites as a centerpiece of both labor market and welfare reform efforts.  Some analysts thus note a convergence around a new, post-Keynesian policy paradigm, marked by a consensus on promoting investment in education as a means to cope with both old and new social risks: in the old category, unemployment, sickness, disability and old age; in the new category, long-term, part-time or otherwise unstable unemployment, lack of skills and single parenthood.  This of course raises huge questions about the role, functions and nature of education and its relationship to the welfare state.  In order to carve out a sociological contribution to this political state of things, this paper seeks to integrate major strands of comparative welfare and education research.  I first consider education as a welfare institution: drawing on the work of Gøsta Esping-Andersen and major themes from the sociology of education, I conceive of education systems as having de/commodifying, stratifying, public/private, de/familializing and institutional dimensions.  I then offer ways of defining and measuring these dimensions using data from the OECD and UNESCO on eighteen countries.  Second, I consider education as an ex-ante component of welfare regimes, looking at how education systems five dimensions vary with non-education welfare spending across categories (using OECD SOCX data).  Taken together, the paper provides first steps toward a more comprehensive understanding of the ways in which education systems do or do not serve welfare functions, and how they vary across welfare regimes."
0,"Although research has documented that earnings inequality within organizations affects many dimensions of organizational outcomes, we have little knowledge about what makes some organizations more unequal than others in terms of the earnings distribution. In order to study the relationship between organizational characteristics and within-organization earnings inequality, I analyze a nationally representative sample of manufacturing establishments in the National Employer Survey (NES). The analysis focuses on how organization-level characteristics Such as workforce composition within the establishment and flexible workplace practices are associated with within-establishment earnings inequality. The results suggest that gender heterogeneity, percentage of newly hired workers within the organization, and flexible workplace practices such as job rotation and self-managed teams are significantly associated with earnings dispersion within manufacturing establishments.

0,"Parent and peer influences on academic achievement are well documented, but little research has examined links to romantic involvement during the adolescent period. This study draws on interviews with 572 currently dating teens and results indicate that the romantic partner's grades are significantly related to adolescent respondents' self-reported grades, even after their own orientation toward school and traditional family, peer, and demographic controls have been taken into account. We hypothesize, following results on peer influence processes, that this concordance reveals a tendency to select similar partners, but may involve social influence processes as well. A longitudinal analysis in which partners' grades predict respondents' grades reported at the second interview (controlling for wave one grades and the other covariates) lends support to this view. We also explore the role of age, gender and race/ethnicity as affecting the nature of these relationships. Finally, we draw on the content of in-depth interviews elicited from a subset of the respondents to illustrate both types of mechanisms (selection vs. influence). These results underscore the importance of continuing to explore the role of romantic partners in connection with a broad range of prosocial as well as problem adolescent outcomes.(c) 2008 published by Elsevier Inc."

Time diary and questionnaire data (regarding work schedules and meal planning) from a sample of 300 households from the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The analysis shows that mothers work and commuting time interfere with the work of caring and increase the time spent purchasing takeout food. Non-standard work schedules of parents also increased the time spent buying takeout food."
0,"This article examines how planners have helped buttress the rational society and shaped the logic of suburban development in the U.S. In attempts to maintain an expert class and pursue progress through scientific management, planning inadvertently helps sustain the suburban sprawl that characterizes development in post-WWII America. We explore how the planning industry's efforts to reform housing development gets undermined through use of an elitist professional discourse, cooption by capitalist developers and real estate interests, and a lack of dedication to democracy and public inclusion. We also examine how Critical Planning Theory seeks to challenge the dominant rationalized model. Finally, considering the challenges that the planning industry continues to face, we ask what it would take to recast planning as a serious reform effort."
0,"The purpose of this article was to identify manifestations of a social discourse that construct those who are homeless as an existential problem. Based on 4 years of ethnographic data and grounded theory analysis, we illustrate the nature of exclusionary social practices that emerge from discourse on the homeless problem as well as the conflicting identities experienced by those who are homeless. Herein we frame the data using DuBois concept of double consciousness. Our findings indicate that those who are homeless mix together discourses of value and legitimacy with self-applied stigmas and self-denigrating political perspectives in ways that directly mirror DuBois notion of the conflicting nature of African and American identities around the end of the nineteenth century. We illustrate identity problems that manifest in the contemporary conflict between being both homeless and American."
0,"The involuntary relocation of people for development purposes has become prevalent across the world in recent decades. Depression is one of the documented negative outcomes of forced relocation among re-settlers. Viewing the affected population simply as passive victims, past studies have largely ignored the coping strategies employed by individual re-settlers in dealing with stress they experienced in the relocation process. Focusing on Three Gorges Project-induced relocation, this study examines coping strategies employed by re-settlers using panel data collected before and after relocation. We found that emotion-focused coping (e.g., planning for the worst, positive comparison) were more effective in dealing with relocation-related depression while problem-focused coping (e.g., bargaining for more compensation) elevated, rather than reduced depression. Emotion-focused coping reduces depression not only directly but also indirectly by restoring re-settlers’ sense of control. This study contributes to the literature by identifying coping mechanisms that are effective in dealing with stresses for project-induced re-settlers."
0,"Wealth production within a ""risk society"" typically depends on production technologies that expose citizens to dangerous substances. Knowledge of such exposure is, more often than not, hidden from the public. Empirical analyses show that citizens' claims of illnesses caused by risky exposures are frequently contested by the institutions that select production technologies and control information: the government, corporations, and physicians. In this article, we use the risk society thesis as a framework for addressing gaps in the environmental illness literature-specifically, the basis for authorities' contestations of illness claims for which the exposure-illness link is scientifically confirmed. Using case methods, including in-depth interviews with 124 citizens, analyses center on the contested illness claims of nuclear weapons workers at the federal Oak Ridge Nuclear Reservation. Results highlight how institutional and organizational resources provided authorities with tactical leverage, and allowed them to manufacture an ambiguous climate for public discourse. This discourse focused on the exposure-illness link for a particular individual and their specific symptoms rather than the established exposure-illness links in general. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for analyses of environmental exposure specifically, but also the seemingly contradictory tension between the risk society need to restrict information to experts and democracy need for open discourse."
0,"Konty (2005) introduced the idea of microanomiewhen an individual cognitively gives higher priority to self-oriented values than to group-oriented values.  Konty measured values with the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) and found that a high ratio of self-enhancement values to self-transcendent values was significantly related to deviant behavior.  The study also found that the effects of gender on deviance were effectively reduced to zero by including microanomie in the regression model.  In this study we replicate Kontys findings using three new samples from the United States, Germany and Japan in an effort to test the generalizability of the concept to other samples.  We first test whether or not microanomie predicts deviant behavior at the individual level in a combined cross-cultural sample.  Our preliminary results replicate Kontys findings that microanomie is related to deviant behavior at the individual level.  A second question of interest is whether or not microanomie varies across cultures and whether or not that variation is related to differences in deviance across the cultures.  Again, our preliminary results indicate that it does."
0,"This is a theoretical sociological study of leadership. Although sociologists have contributed important theories and research on authority and power, there is not yet a developed leadership theory in sociology. There are various sociological theories that can be used in the study of leadership.  In this study, I focus only on the contributions of institutionalism, both the old and new institutionalism. The theory of institutional leadership of sociologist Philip Selznick (1956) is revisited in this paper to refresh the memory of sociological contribution to the leadership studies. Based upon Selznicks theory of institutional leadership, I proposed an idea of extended rationality, and put it in the context of studies on rationality and bounded rationality."
0,"Previous research fails to address whether contingent employment benefits individuals' careers more than the alternative they often face: being without a job. Using work history data from Japan, this study shows that accepting a contingent job delays individuals' transition to standard employment more than remaining jobless. Moreover, having a contingent job, rather than having no job, leads Japanese men to have lower occupational status after they transition back to standard employment. I argue that in a highly segmented labor market like Japan's, the strict separation of labor pools for standard and contingent jobs makes being labeled as a contingent worker particularly detrimental. Meanwhile, the legacy of Japan's welfare corporatism alleviates the stigma of unemployment, making individuals better off jobless than having a contingent job. This research thus demonstrates the importance of labor-market contexts in shaping the scarring effects of contingent work arrangements."
0,"This paper examines the realtionship between education and racial experiences among Mexican Americans. We find that more educated respondents are more likely to be perceived as Mexicans, to be stereotyped by others, and to experience discrimination. Overall, the relationship between education and experiences with racialization that we identify are quite significant. It appears that more educated Mexican Americans live and work in environments with more Whites and non-Mexicans and therefore they encounter more stereotyping and discrimination."
0,"This article employs a unique method of inferring the legal status of Mexican immigrants in the Survey of Income and Program Participation to offer new evidence of the role of legal authorization in the United States on workers' wages. We estimate wage trajectories for four groups: documented Mexican immigrants, undocumented Mexican immigrants, U.S-born Mexican Americans and native non-Latino whites. Our estimates reveal a gross 17 percent wage disparity between documented and undocumented Mexican immigrant men, and a 9 percent documented-undocumented wage disparity for Mexican immigrant women. When worker human capital and occupation are held constant, these wage gaps reduce to 8 and 4 percent, respectively. We also find large differences in returns to human capital with undocumented Mexican immigrants having the lowest wage returns to human capital and having very slow wage growth over time."
0,"Sociologists have given considerable attention to identifying the neighborhood-level social-interactional mechanisms that influence outcomes such as crime, educational attainment, and health. Yet, cultural mechanisms are often overlooked in quantitative studies of neighborhood effects. This paper adds a cultural dimension to neighborhood effects research by exploring the consequences of legal cynicism. Legal cynicism refers to a cultural frame in which people perceive the law as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety. The authors find that legal cynicism explains why homicide persisted in certain Chicago neighborhoods during the 1990s despite declines in poverty and declines in violence city-wide."
0,"Under the Reagan administration in the 1980s, numerous programs focusing on the poorer segments of society experienced cutbacks.  However, homeless policy at the federal level for the first time flourished. This research focused on the role of gender and the family, as women and children became the new face of the homeless in our society. In a quantitative analysis of federal Congressional bills on homelessness from 1977-1988 (n=115), results indicate that although discourse on homeless women, children, and families increased, there failed to be any substantive policy action that awarded monetary benefits to them at the Congressional level.  Rather Congressional bills which involved homeless veterans, or work programs for homeless individuals had the greatest probability of becoming public law and receiving monetary compensation.  Although the new face of the homeless was women, children, and families, this facet only garnered surface level public and Congressional elite sympathy, no monetary sympathy at the national level"

However, measurement efforts have been dominated by attention to subjective, individualized facets of religiousness such as spirituality, beliefs, and attitudes, and little attention has been paid to congregate aspects beyond the single item measuring attendance at services.  We develop and test measures for religious practices and feelings occurring during regular congregational worship services.  Respondents (N=576) were religiously-diverse community-dwelling adults interviewed prior to cardiac surgery.  Exploratory factor analysis of the new items with a pool of standard items yielded a readily interpretable solution involving seven correlated but separable factors and one index variable, with high levels of internal consistency.  We describe religious affiliation and demographic differences in these indices.  Attendance at religious services exposes individuals to multifaceted physical, emotional, social, and spiritual experiences that may promote physical health through multiple pathways."
0,"In the months of September and October of 2010, seven young gay men committed suicide. Queer youth as a whole are six times more likely than their heterosexual peers to commit suicide. Laws are being drawn on anti-bullying with a hope that if the bullying stops, then it will all get better. This paper challenges that notion. Through the analytical lenses of Queer Theory and Psychoanalytic Feminism, the author places the root cause on masculinity and the masculine construction of the Other. Until this is addressed, those suicide statistics will hardly change. The author offers some solutions that may serve to better address the deeper issue of queer youth suicide."
0,"During the last decade General Strain Theory (GST) has made headway in the criminological literature and became one of the dominant theories explaining juvenile delinquency. The theory, which has stimulated research in the U.S. and abroad, emphasizes the role of strain and negative life events as antecedents to anger and other negative emotions, which in turn, lead to criminal behavior. Consistent with previous research, we assume in this work that juvenile immigrants in Israel are more inclined toward delinquent behaviors than their native born counterparts due to higher levels of blocked opportunities and negative life events. The study examines this assumption using a sample comprised of immigrant and native adolescents, and hypothesizes that immigrant youths from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and Ethiopia would score higher than their native-born adolescents on the strain and negative emotions factors. Furthermore we test the notion that anger mediates the effect of individuals strains effect on crime and that immigrants interaction with anger is more likely to result in crime. Results from OLS, and logistic regressions provide support for the GST assertions. Implications of our findings on future investigation within the General Strain perspective are discussed."
0,"Using data from a 2006-07 US survey of workers, we examine the association between creative work and work-to-family conflict, focusing special attention on the demands associated with creative work and their implications for work-family multitasking. Findings indicate that creative work is associated negatively with work-to-family conflict and stressful work-related thoughts-but these associations are suppressed by the following patterns: (1) creative work is associated with greater work demands; (2) those conditions are associated with higher levels of work-family multitasking; and (3) demands and multitasking increase work-to-family conflict and stressful boundary-spanning thoughts. Taken together, these patterns reveal suppression effects: Individuals with creative work would report lower work-to-family conflict and fewer stressful thoughts were it not for their exposure to work and boundary-spanning demands and their more frequent work-family multitasking. Collectively, our findings reveal previously undocumented patterns in the ways that the demands associated with creative work influence stress in the work-family interface. "
0,"Political power structure research has questioned what role, if any, outside actors play in policymaking for over a century, with three main competing perspectives emerging: state-centered theory, pluralism, and elite-power theory. The debates between these three perspectives remain largely unresolved because much of the work in this area has focused on the question of outsider unity rather than outsider influence, and/or relied heavily on specific policy cases rather than policymaking more generally. In this paper, I look at day-to-day policymaking over a two-year period to test the predictions of these theories. Analytically, I use relational analyses to examine the relationship between PAC campaign contributions and roll call voting in the 104th U.S. Congress (1995-96), attempting to address the issue of causality in this relationship. I find that PAC contributions, in general, have a significant positive effect on roll call voting. I also find, examining specific types of PAC contributions, that capitalist PAC contributions have a significant positive effect on roll call voting while labor PAC contributions do not. My findings thus support the predictions of elite-power theory, but fail to support the predictions of state-centered theory or pluralism."
0,"This study examines the relationship between crime and processes of urban revitalization, or gentrification. Drawing on recent urban demography research, we hypothesize that gentrification progressed rapidly in many American cities over the last decade of the twentieth century, and that these changes had implications for area crime rates. Criminological theories hold competing hypotheses for the connections between gentrification and crime, and quantitative studies of this link remain infrequent and limited. Using two measures of gentrification and longitudinal tract-level demographic and crime data for the city of Seattle, we find that many of Seattle's downtown tracts underwent rapid revitalization during the 1990s, and that these areas (1) saw reductions in crime relative to similar tracts that did not gentrify, and (2) were areas with higher-than-average crime at the beginning of the decade. Moreover, using a within-tract longitudinal design, we find that yearly housing investments in the 1980s showed a modest positive association with crime change, while yearly investments in the 1990s showed the opposite pattern. Our findings suggest a curvilinear gentrification-crime relationship, whereby gentrification in its earlier stages is associated with small increases in crime, but gentrification in its more consolidated form is associated with modest crime declines. Implications of these results for criminological theory, urban development, and broader crime patterns are discussed."
0,"In this unprecedented age of gay and lesbian visibility, this paper examines the actual embodied experiences of lesbian and queer women.  Drawing on in-depth interviews with a racially diverse group of non-straight women, I listen to the narratives they tell about the relationship between their sexuality and their raced and gendered bodies.  Some women saw their sexuality as specifically offering them the opportunity to pay with gender and bodily performance in ways they found liberating and empowering.  At the same time, other non-straight women experienced greater corporeal constraint, often reinforced by others policing their gender and racial presentations.  Some experienced this policing as overt violence, while for others it took the form of exclusion and invisibility."
0,"In recent years, social scientists have identified not just heterosexism and homophobia as social problems, but also heteronormativity-the mundane, everyday ways that heterosexuality is privileged and taken for granted as normal and natural. There is little empirical research, however on how heterosexuality is reproduced and then normalized for individuals. Using survey data from more than 600 mothers of young children, ages 3 to 6 years old, this article examines how mothers normalize heterosexuality for young children. The data suggest that most mothers, who are parenting in a gendered and heteronormative context to begin with, assume that their children are heterosexual, describe romantic and adult relationships to children as only heterosexual, and make gays and lesbians invisible to their children. Those who consider that their children could some day be gay tend to adopt one of three strategies in response: Most pursue a passive strategy of ""crossing their fingers"" and hoping otherwise. A very few try to prepare their children for the possibility of being gay. A larger group, primarily mothers from conservative Protestant religions, work to prevent homosexuality. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for understanding sexual identity development and the construction of heteronormativity."
0,"Immigration from Latin America to the United States has and will continue to change dramatically. Over the last few decades, Latinos in the U.S. have increasingly become an immigrant population, diverse in terms of national origin, and dispersed throughout the United States. As Latino immigrants choose not to settle in traditional states such as California, New York and Texas, new receiving areas in the southeast and Midwest are now experiencing large influxes of Latinos. The implications of this change are evident in the social and civic incorporation of Latinos, race relations between Latinos and other racial and ethnic groups as well as political representation. This paper explores recent trends in Latino immigration to new emergent states using data from the 2006 Latino National Survey.   Comparing several states in new and traditional receiving areas, the analysis examines race relations, employment and political competition across racial groups and feelings of linked fate between Latinos and African Americans and whites.  Initial findings suggest that Latinos in both old and new receiving areas perceive closer ties to African Americans in particular than might have been expected given recent research and media coverage."
0,"This article examines an unusual practice-unassisted childbirth-and the ways in which advocates and practitioners manage the stigma they are accorded. Given their ""doubly deviant"" status as not only women who birth at home but also as women who choose to give birth without professional assistance, these women provide a unique case for our theoretical understanding of stigma management. As members of homebirth social networks, the women must reckon with what I term layered stigma, the broad stigma of homebirth as well as the deeper in-group stigma within their deviant community that results from their rejection of midwives as appropriate care providers. By examining the dynamics of stigma management among practitioners of unassisted childbirth, I highlight the complex, situation-dependent nature of stigma and the impact of its management on women's sense of self."
0,"Research suggests that there are differences in the frequency with which white and African American students are punished in schools, with African American students being 2.3 times more likely to be suspended than white students. Most of the research on school punishment has focused on documenting race differences and looking for student and school-level factors to help explain disproportionality in out-of-school suspension. This study aims to fill the gap in the literature by analyzing the role of the teacher in affecting student punishment in a large, urban, primarily minority student district. Results indicate that positive teacher behavior toward students and positive teacher expectations of students reduces suspension from school."
0,"A classical sociological source of new insights was always based on examining the surprising and emergent consequences of goal-oriented activity. Surprising side-effects were mainly seen as a deviation from rational planning or goal attainment. Today, in many fields of ecological restoration, the boundaries between research and implementation are permeable in both directions. Here the conceptual framework of real-world experimentation can be understood as a means to positively deal with uncertainty and surprises. As many areas of ecological design cannot be based on the institutional conditions of unrestricted scientific knowledge production, several challenges have to be addressed: (1) negotiating the experimental design among heterogeneous actors, (2) turning concerned citizens into participating actors, and (3) handling surprises and re-negotiating the design. By using a working model of the requirements and the operating mode of real-world experiments two cases in ecological restoration will be illustrated: an ecological restoration process of Montrose Point, a peninsula built on landfill in Lake Michigan on the North Side of Chicago and the restoration and design of former brown-coal mining areas in Eastern Germany around the city of Leipzig. It will be shown how in the interaction of natural and socio-cultural elements, positive as well as negative surprises (e.g., strong weather, changing attitudes towards nature) can be understood as positioned at the core of ecological design processes and not as mere side-effects or anomalies. To avoid failures, real-world experiments can provide a legitimate foundation via processes of recursive learning."
0,"This study uses data from multiple rounds of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to describe the frequency with which children from various demographic backgrounds engage in various home literacy activities in kindergarten through the eighth-grade  and to look at the relationship of the childrens reading skill development throughout their first 9 years of school to these home literacy activities while accounting for differences associated with demographic and school characteristics."
0,"Numerous studies conclude that teacher effects on academic achievement are substantial in size. Education is about more than academic achievement, and we know very little about teachers' effectiveness in promoting students' social development. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -- Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS- K), we estimate teacher effects on social as well as academic outcomes. We find that teacher effects on social development are sizeable, and are approximately twice as large as teacher effects on academic development. We further determine that teachers who produce better than average academic results are not the same teachers who produce better than average social results. However, we find that observable characteristics of teachers and the instructional approaches utilized in their classrooms are weak predictors of teacher effects. Finally, we show that the development of social skills has a positive effect on the growth of academic skills, and therefore teachers who are good at teaching social skills provide an additional indirect boost to academic skills in addition to their direct teaching of academic skills.  We conclude that current policy debates over what it means to be a ""highly qualified teacher"" should also take social development into account."
0,"In this paper we argue the dominant strands of contemporary social and cultural theory rely on a misleading model of belief formation and a misguided conception of what beliefs are, how and in what format they are embodied and how and under what circumstances they are accessed by the social agent in naturally occurring situations. This has led cultural sociologists to mischaracterize the key phenomena of interest to a ``sociology of belief.'' We argue that the contemporary theory of belief, in conceptualizing belief as primarily representational, propositional and as a tool for the production of inferences, and in conceptualizing action as the end-point of a chain of logical implications, provides an impoverished picture of how belief enters into the production of action. Drawing on practice theory, we suggest that---in direct contradiction to the classical conceptualization of belief---persons can form pre-theoretical, pre-conceptual beliefs about the world, and that they can reason and form expectations about the world at this pre-reflexive level. We review recent theoretical developments in studies of infant development that depart from dynamic systems theory and show that their results converge nicely with, and provide micro-models for, various phenomena (such as hysteresis) that should be at the centerpiece of any sociology theory of belief."
0,"The generation of knowledge about atrocities, and their framing as crime, is examined for six (eventually eight) Western countries. Specifically, we explore how the violence in Darfur is presented in newspaper reports across time periods and consider how different judicial interventions shape knowledge creation in each period. Theories that predict globalized discourses are juxtaposed with others that suggest country-specific knowledges, patterns of acknowledgement and framing. An analysis of roughly 2,800 media reports (eventually 3,500), as well as a preliminary review of state department documents, nongovernmental organization websites, and preliminary interviews with government officials, journalists, and activists, speak to the relative strength of these competing theories. This paper presents first results from an ongoing NSF-funded research project."
0,"We used adopted and biological children from Waves I and 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households to study the links between parents' marital conflict, divorce and children's behavior problems. The standard family environment model assumes that marital conflict and divorce increase the risk of childrens behavior problems. The passive genetic model assumes that parents' and children behavior are linked because of genetic transmission from parents to children. The child effects model assumes that parents' marital distress is the result of (rather than the cause of) children's behavior. Our analysis shows that the associations between parents' divorce and marital conflict and children's behavior problems are comparable for biological and adopted children. Moreover, the primary direction of influence appears to run from parents to children. Taken together, these results Provide support for the standard family environment model."
0,"To a certain extent, dramatic improvements in computing capacity have been commonplace throughout the information age. In 1965, Gordon Moore predicted that integrated circuit capacity would continue to double every two years until well into the foreseeable future (Brock, 2006). In the years since his observation, Moore's Law has predicted computer chip progress with astounding consistency. Year after year, processors have become smaller and faster, while information technologies have become increasingly pervasive and portable. Yet, sophisticated as handheld wireless technologies have become, they are primitive in comparison to the technologies needed to create artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence represents a threshold in computing that will transform machines into human-like intellectual entities."
0,"Identity politics arises out of conditions of systematic stigmatization and structural disadvantage, but sharing a social structural position does not guarantee that people will define themselves and their collectivity in the same way. In fact, because identity politics occupies two major points of tension, it gives rise to several alternative ways of conceptualizing the ""we,"" the collective self. Using ethnographic material gathered on American Jews' understandings of anti-Semitism and its relationship to contemporary politics, this article inductively discerns four alternative models of collective selfhood (embattled, relating, political, and redeemed) that correspond to four alternative narratives of identity politics (reified identity, humanistic dialogue, critical solidarity, and evangelism). These narratives help explain the deep emotions sparked by challenges to people's self-definitions. A comparison to studies of LGBT movements further reveals the utility of this conceptualization and elaborates a model not apparent in the first case."
0,"The subversion and punishment of the adept are pervasive features of all societies.  This phenomenon is a response to the group problem of what to do with the highly able.  The problem arises when a majority of a group is comprised of weak members, yet possesses instrumental leaders, who must decide what to do with high performers in the group.  Reward systems are subverted to benefit the less able and the adept are cast as deviant.  Patterns of punishment represent both an evasion of achievement norms and an honoring of other values and beliefs.  Punishment is a resolution of two tensions: punishment of the adept for their behavior and protection from the adept for all others who cannot perform at levels well above the average.  The academic profession is used as a case to describe the phenomenon.  The forms and consequences of punishment are discussed.  It is argued that punishing the adept serves to sustain social systems on which all people, however able, depend.  The discussion concludes by illustrating the ubiquity of the phenomenon throughout social institutions."
0,"For the last 250 years, pedagogies of language for deaf students have become a site of social control, public debate/conflict, and social inequality.  This paper focuses on “paradigm wars” between critical social control institutions, namely American Sign Language (ASL)-based and oral-based (spoken English) educational institutions.  ASL-based institutions using the bilingual-bicultural (Bi-Bi) approach emphasizes the development of the natural sign language as the first language, then teaches the majority language through reading.  Oral-based educational institutions place spoken English as the primary choice of language pedagogy for deaf students.  Although sign language and spoken English may be perceived as official languages with its own linguistic rules, classifiers, and syntax as well as carrying the same potential of acquisition of a language, they are perceived and signified differently.  This paper examines the ways that the two frameworks present “evidences” to make a case for the most normal avenues to a child’s education.  For the constructions of the oral school, to talk is human; for the constructions of ASL school, to sign is human.  As a result, this determination may have reproduced unintended social inequality and social stratification by re-shifting social representations of deafness and sign language including its cultural recognition.  Finally, this paper offers a possible alternative view of reapproprating of the corporeal differences of deafness including positive strategies to minimize reproduced social stratification, oppression, social inequality, and divisions when dealing with deafness in education."
0,"We adapt a metaphor from life course studies to designate the whole of one's possessions, across time, as a convoy of material support. This dynamic collection of things supports daily life and the self, but it can also present difficulty in later life. To alleviate the purported burdens of the material convoy, a discourse has arisen that urges elders and their family members to reduce the volume of possessions. An analysis of 11 such possession management texts shows authors addressing two distinct audiences about elders' need to downsize: family members and elders themselves. Authors who speak to family members do so with an urgent, unsentimental tone that echoes mainstream clutter-control advice about disorderly, overfull households. In texts for elders, the standard critique about consumption and unruly lives is gentler, more sensitive to the meaning of things, and underplays the emotions of divestment. There is stress on the responsibility to spare the next generation and control one's legacy. These latter texts seem to respect that downsizing in later life symbolizes a narrowing of the life world."
0,"Recent decades have seen an increasing influx of high-educated immigrants.  Returns to education have become more complex because some immigrants have received their highest degree in their home country and immigrants in general have concentrated in certain fields.  This paper examines the increasing complexity by including the country and field of degree into the stratification system and a focus on the three major professional-sending Asian countries.  Using the NSFs 1993 National Survey of College Graduates to examine degree-job match and earnings of degree holders of bachelor or above, our study confirms that, all else equal, (1) there is no difference in returns to education between whites and Asians and (2) U.S. degrees provide a great advantage over foreign degrees.  New findings include (1) a non-nativity effect among high-educated workers, i.e., Asian immigrants with U.S. degrees actually earn more than their native counterparts; (2) China degrees are the most disadvantaged, followed by Indian degrees; (3) Philippine degrees facilitate degree-job match but provide lower earnings; and (4) engineering, computer/math sciences, and health profession fields facilitate degree-job match but only the first two ensure greater earnings."
0,"Despite the proliferation of scholarship on sexual citizenship, there is a surprising amount of silence on both age and race in the literature.  This essay argues that the exclusion of racialized and teenage subjects not only exacerbates the marginalization of these (often overlapping) groups but also renders existing critiques and alternative visions of sexual citizenship insufficient.  By situating teenage sexual subjectivities at the center of an intersectional theory of sexual citizenship, critical citizenship theorists can not only better account for the normalizing discourses of racialized heterosexism, but also begin to theorize teenage sexual citizenship across multiple and intersecting dimensions of difference."
0,"Georg Simmel's ideas on the modern development of science and technology have rarely been discussed and virtually never been viewed as part of his sociology. In this paper some of the theoretical and conceptual implications of Simmel's take on modern science and technology and its course of development will be highlighted. It is argued that Simmel offers several important inputs for contemporary theorizing in the sociology of science and technology, most important here his idea of the development of modern culture which combines an understanding of the production of side effects in science with the cyclic closure of the cleavage between a technology-push and a social choice or demand pull perspective."
0,"Are indigenous investors in Third World export platforms more stable than their allegedly ""footloose"" foreign rivals? While mainstream economists hold that investor behavior is independent of investor identity and therefore call for the parallel treatment of domestic and foreign firms, their critics hold that indigenous investors are more dedicated than their foreign counterparts and therefore call for industrial policies designed to cultivate and defend native entrepreneurs. Who is correct? The author uses a unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data to document and account for the relative stability and dynamism of indigenous investors in the Dominican Republic's largest export processing zone and thereby brings economic sociology back from the margins of development theory-and development theory back into the heartland of sociology."
0,"Previous sociological inquiry into the various arms of the animal advocacy movement, and social movements in general, has repeatedly noted the critical importance of radical factions in the overall impact of the movement.  Thus, while these individuals comprise a decidedly small minority of the entire activist population, the effects of their work is far-reaching.  Yet, in the existing scholarly literature on animal advocacy, little attention has been paid to understanding the socially constructed justifications and rationales these individuals employ in order to engage in, defend and encourage militant direct action (MDA) on behalf of nonhuman animals.  Informed by Mills (1940), Scott and Lyman (1968) and building on recent research by contemporary social constructionists, this paper explores the vocabularies of motive these marginalized movement actors employ to rationalize behaviors that may be viewed as untoward by the public, their targets and, in many cases, fellow activists."
0,"Professionals in many different fields have long recognized that trauma affects not only the individual victims, but also those who assist them.  However, research on vicarious traumatization and emotion management have failed to recognize a deeper, more life-altering effect of working with traumatized clientsnamely, soul pain.  Using in-depth interviews with advocates working on behalf of survivors of physical and sexual violence, I present data to suggest that, as a direct consequence of hearing countless stories of human brutality, staff members experience a profound, woundedness of the spirit that may best be described as soul pain.  This finding is important not only because it expands upon our current understanding of the occupational hazards of the helping professions, but also because it reveals a hitherto unexamined dimensionthat of the soul or spiritthat is impacted by ones activities in the workplace."
0,"Does increasing the minimum wage reduce the high school completion rate? Previous research has suffered from (1. narrow time horizons, (2. potentially inadequate measures of states' high school completion rates, and (3. potentially inadequate measures of minimum wage rates. Overcoming each of these limitations, we analyze the impact of changes in state and federal minimum wage rates on state high school completion rates for the graduating classes of 1982 through 2005. Our state-level analyses, which consist of a series of state and year fixed-effects models with controls for state-year time-varying covariates, provide no support for the argument that increasing the minimum wage reduces rates of high school completion."
0,"This paper brings together elements from the sociology of historical events, social movements, and literature to illuminate a largely neglected venue of class formation--the late 19th century novel.  I trace the network linkages of counter-narratives that rippled outward from the great labor rebellion of 1877 as cultural transformations.  New Linquistic categories, assumptions about the nature of peoples, stories, and images began with a 'narrative cascade' by press and politicians in the midst of the uprising and soon began to take shape in a newly emerging form of fiction--the ""realist economic novel.""  I do a detailed textual and contextual analysis of one such anonymously authored novel--""The Bread-Winners""--the opening gambit in this new genre, and show how it ""narratively coupled"" a series of threats to Victorian elite male privilege while igniting a series of novel counter-narratives.  I suggest that the narrativized struggles and threats depicted in these realist novels and in pages of literary criticism about them served to help shape changing elite discourse on social class in late 19th-century America and thereby shaped collective identities rooted in class terms."
0,"The causal impact of higher education on earnings may be heterogeneous across different members of a population. Using a newly developed instrumental-variable method in economics, we illustrate heterogeneous treatment effects of higher education on earnings resulting from sorting mechanisms that select individuals with certain unobserved attributes into college education. The setting of our empirical work is contemporary Taiwan - a transitional economy that has recently experienced a rapid expansion in higher education. We find distinct patterns by gender, with selection bias most clearly shown among women but not among men: the college return to earnings is on average greater for women who actually attended college than women who did not attend college.

0,"Becoming a parent remains a key marker for the transition into adulthood, especially for many women. Infertility thwarts this transition. In this research, we investigate one aspect of the gendered nature of adult development within the life course. Specifically, this study examines interview data from 40 infertile women in order to explore how this group of women cope with what they perceive to be a failed life course transition and how it affects their sense of self. We find that this failed life course transition altered these women's relationships with others. Further, this change had a corresponding effect on their self. These women's inability to do gender by being mothers challenges their sense of themselves as normal adult women. Using West and Zimmerman's concept of doing gender, we argue that infertility can be experienced as a failed life course transition among women who desire children. We also demonstrate how this failed transition has a distinctly gendered component."
0,"Worker displacement has become a common feature of employment in the ""flexible economy."" While studies of income losses and the duration of unemployment after displacement abound, and popular accounts argue that workers often lose status, less empirical attention has been paid to the quality or prestige of employment displaced workers are able to secure after a downsizing event. This paper helps to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on changes in occupational prestige among a nationally representative sample of displaced workers who became reemployed from the January 2004 Displaced Workers and Employee Tenure Supplement of the Current Population Survey. Our findings show that displaced workers with higher levels of education, net of other factors, fared significantly better than others in job quality upon reemployment, highlighting the importance of education in retaining status and privilege in the new economy.

0,"In American society, living apart from parents is widely regarded as a marker of adulthood.  Focusing on the nations two largest metropolitan areas, this paper examines the age-specific likelihood that young people will reside with parents or live apart.  IPUMS data from Census 2000 show that there are not only marked racial-ethnic differences, but also differences between the two cities.  Young people living in the New York CMSA are much more likely to share a home with parents than their counterparts in the Los Angeles CMSA.  The CMSA differences are particularly remarkable for whites in their early 20s.  Further analysis confirms that residential arrangements are related to other adult social roles and personal resources.  Controlling for roles and resources, however, has little effect on either place or race effects on parental co-residence.  Racial-ethnic differences in parental co-residence are affected by immigrant generation status, however.  Compared to their native-born counterparts, the first generation is less likely to live with parents while the 1.5 generation is more likely."
0,"In 2000, Jonathan Pontell published a book called Generation Jones pointing to the existence of an overlooked generation slipped in between the Baby Boom and Generation X.  This generation, born between 1954 and 1965 was demographically part of the baby boom but was too young for most of the cultural events typically associated with this generation. In this paper I show evidence that the members of Generation Jones were distinct not only because they missed out on many cultural events, but because they missed out on employment opportunities as well. An age-based analysis of occupational trends shows a marked decline in entry into professional jobs within the Generation Jones cohort and a slowing of access to managerial positions among men. These findings have two important implications. The first implication is a practical one. Generation Jones corresponds exactly to the cohort in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. These findings suggest that research using the NLSY79 may be problematic because it reflects the experiences of an unusual generation. The second implication of these findings is the need to further investigate the possible causes these outcomes. I discuss two potential factors. One possibility is that Generation Jones suffered from a demographic disadvantage. At the tail end of the Baby Boom, their opportunities for mobility were restricted because the rungs above them on the ladder were already filled. A second possibility is that Generation Jones entered the labor market during a particularly bad economic recession and therefore suffered permanent setbacks."
0,"This study examines endorsement and authorization as two social mechanisms that can induce perceptions of legitimacy for individuals who manage work teams. Endorsement is the support of a manager by one's own team members, whereas authorization is the support of a team manager stemming from a higher bureaucratic level. Applying these mechanisms to specific work teams we hypothesize that (1. a team member who observes that other team members endorse a manager and the upper management authorizes the manager will perceive that manager's acts to be more legitimate; (2. in the context of the team environment the effect of endorsement will be greater than that of authorization; and (3. perceived legitimacy will mediate the effects of endorsement and authorization on positive outcomes such as team members' efficacy and commitment. These hypotheses were tested using 320 respondents from 56 Korean work teams. The results provide overall support of these hypotheses. As predicted, endorsement and authorization are key mechanisms significantly enhancing legitimacy. Further, the effect of endorsement on legitimacy is greater than that of authorization, and legitimacy partially mediates the effects of both endorsement and authorization on team efficacy and commitment. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of prevailing theories of legitimacy."
0,"This article explores the origins of a social form with lasting and profound sociological implications: the corporation. Though corporations date back as far as the Roman Republic, the early United States fostered a significant transformation in corporate law Shortly after the American Revolution, several states pioneered a system whereby corporate charters became available to almost anyone (at a price), leading (eventually) to a proliferation of corporate charters unlike anything ever seen before in world history. This proliferation of corporate charters first occurred in colonies that were originally chartered as corporations: Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, all of which used the corporate organizational form for a wide array of social pursuits. These colonies also experienced repeated conflict with the Crown over the rights and privileges of corporations. As American ""states,"" they built on these experiences to liberalize access to the means of incorporation and to elucidate the rights and freedoms of corporations. Other studies aptly document the diffusion of the corporate organizational form after 1800; this article takes up the antecedents to the use and popularity of the modern corporate organizational form. These observations do not supersede scholarly work regarding the economic origins of the American business corporation, but they do shed valuable light on the interdependence of states and markets, as well as the nature of institutional-legal transformation more generally."
0,"To clarify how monitoring by community members may shape individuals’ revealed preferences, we elicit preferences for equivalent monetary values of cash, food, or a mixture from respondents in northern Kenya, a chronically food insecure arid and semi arid region. We develop a model wherein respondents’ valuation of payouts varies by elicitation strategy. We randomly assign participants to two elicitation strategies. Members in the first group reveal preferences privately while members in the second group reveal preferences in front of their peers. Results from our logistic regression show that changes in elicitation methods do shift revealed preferences, indicating that preferences for cash and food are shaped by often-overlooked influences, such as peer monitoring. These findings point to the importance of framing effects in communities where cooperation is an important social norm and suggest directions for research on decision-making and group behavior."
0,"Conventional wisdom suggests that when institutional logics overlap, the production of hybrids signifies collapse, blending, or easy coexistence. The author provides an alternative interpretation: hybrids can maintain a distinctive boundary and can emerge from contestation, not coexistence. This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic-commercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics."

(1 population growth's effect on development depends on age-structure; (2 historic population density (used here as an indicator of preindustrial social complexity) boosts contemporary economic performance; (3. ethnic polarization impairs economic growth; and (4. a nation's degree of sociolinguistic integration positively influences economic performance. Investigating annual changes in real gross domestic product per capita from 1970 to 2000, our pooled time-series analyses of 101 developed and developing countries generally support these hypotheses net of common alternative explanations, suggesting that the etiology of economic growth COLT Id benefit from the reintroduction of classic and contemporary sociological theories"
0,"This paper analyzes cultural narratives constructed in newspaper articles about the various parties (doctors, legislators, law enforcement officers, and pill users) involved with the so-called “pill mill epidemic” in the state of Florida. More specifically, the analysis focuses on how news stories about “pill mills”- pain management clinics suspected of illegally dispensing narcotic painkillers - create cultural identities that reflect a melodramatic view of the moral order, with victims, villains, and heroes, and how these narratives may affect people with medically unexplained chronic pain who rely on prescription pain medications for treatment."
0,"Cyber bullying, the use of information and communication technologies to intentionally &#8206;harm others, has become an important area of research. Studies had begun to investigate &#8206;the extent of cyber bullying and personality characteristics of the victims. Less is known &#8206;on the effect of online specific activities and the role of parental mediation on the &#8206;likelihood of being bullied. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature and &#8206;conducts a secondary analysis of a representative sample of the U.S. youth population,  &#8206;the Teens and Parents survey conducted by the Pew and American Life project (n=935). &#8206;The results indicate that the risk of youth being bullied is higher for adolescents that have &#8206;an active profile in social networking sites and participate in chat rooms but playing &#8206;games online not. There are gender differences in risk factors. Few parental mediation &#8206;techniques are protective but most not. The results indicate the need for more parental &#8206;participation to reduce the youth risks that derive from Internet use for interpersonal &#8206;communication. &#8206;"
0,"This paper employs a field experiment to assess whether interpersonal contact changes domiciled individuals' attitudes of the homeless. Volunteers for Project Homeless Connect-a one-day event that provides social services to the homeless-were asked to complete a pre- and post-survey. The results provide mixed support for the contact hypothesis. After volunteering, respondents were far less likely to see homelessness as the result of individual characteristics, such as substance abuse or work aversion. However, opinion was remarkably stable when it came to policy preferences. The results cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that individuals' perceptions of the causes of homelessness track closely with their preferences for governmental policy. "
0,"Nations and nationalism remain relevant even in the context of increased global integration. At the same time, as commodity chains become longer, more transnational, and increasingly complex, the linkages between national identity, global capitalism, and political and economic elites are evolving. In this article, we show how culture-expressed in terms of national attachment and collective heritage-is a key means by which elites assert their power along global commodity chains. Specifically, we use the tequila commodity chain as a lens for analyzing how notions of patrimony, and the attendant reliance on the language of shared collective experience, are mobilized to forward corporate agendas in the global marketplace. Focusing on the interplay between global processes and local responses, we argue that the Mexican state and tequila companies promote notions of nationalness at the expense of the agave farmers, small-scale distillers, and communities where tequila is produced. We show how three central themes are part of this process: the protection of place, the maintenance of quality, and the defense of national interests. This article illustrates how new forms of national attachments are emerging under globalization by integrating an analysis of culture into commodity chain research."

0,"Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, this study employs propensity score modeling to measure the effects of participation in varsity football (among men) and varsity basketball (among men and women) in the 10th grade on students' CPAs and math test scores in the twelfth grade. This study also investigates whether the effect of sports participation on student achievement differs between black and white students. The results show that participation in varsity football negatively affects the 12th grade GPAs of black, but not white, men but does not affect the math test scores of either of these subgroups. Moreover, varsity basketball participation leads to higher GPAs in the 12th grade among white, but not black, women. Implications of the different operationalizations of sports participation, the investigation of different student subpopulations, and the different methods of analysis are discussed. "
0,"Why did the transition from socialism to capitalism result in improved growth in some countries and significant economic decline in others? Scholars have advanced three main arguments: (1) successful countries rapidly implemented neoliberal policies; (2) failures were not due to policies but to poor institutional environments; and (3) policies were counterproductive because they damaged the state. We present a state-centered theory and empirically demonstrate for the first time one of several possible mechanisms linking neoliberal policies to poor economic performance: mass privatization programs, where implemented, created a massive fiscal shock for post-communist governments, thereby undermining the development of private-sector governance institutions and severely exacerbating the transformational recession. We performed cross-national panel regressions for a sample of 25 post-communist countries between 1990 and 2000 and found that mass privatization programs negatively affected economic growth, state capacity, and property rights protection. We further tested these findings with firm-level data from a representative survey of managers in 3,550 companies operating in 24 post-communist countries. Within countries that implemented mass-privatized programs, newly privatized firms were substantially less likely to engage in industrial restructuring but considerably more likely to use barter and accumulate tax arrears than their state-owned counterparts."
0,"The paper analyzes the consequences of timely communication of planned organizational changes on perceived success of reorganizations. Two competing mechanisms are derived and tested with data from a telephone survey (carried out in 2003), among a stratified random sample of n=545 Dutch business organizations who performed a reorganization. The com-mitment perspective predicts that early announcement of reorganization plans increases the likelihood of reorganization success, since it signals concern for the well-being of employees. The influence mechanism predicts that early information decreases the likelihood of reorgani-zation success, because it enables employees to use the information to their own advantage, anticipate on the strategies of management, and organize opposition against the plans. We further argue hat both mechanisms are amplified if the reorganization is expected to have negative effects on the workforce. We found partial support for both mechanisms. Timely communication with employees increases the chances for successful change only if the con-sequences of the change are likely to be negative, but otherwise decreases reorganization suc-cess. Timely communication with middle management increases chances for success inde-pendently of the consequences of the change."
0,"The purpose of this study is to assess the extent to which locus of self (institutional versus impulse), measured using the Twenty Statements Test (TST), moderates the relationship between beliefs about alcohol and the college experience (BACE) and alcohol use among college undergraduates. Although the majority of our respondents listed more idiosyncratic personal characteristics and preferences than consensual social roles in response to the TST, the number of students classified as institutionals was notably higher than what has been reported within the literature. In opposition to our hypothesis that BACE would affect levels of alcohol consumption primarily among these individuals, our results indicated that the perception that alcohol use is integral to the college experience had a relatively minimal effect on drinking among respondents who defined themselves in terms of institutional roles. Moreover, multiple social roles themselves appeared to reduce the effects of BACE on levels of alcohol consumption. More impulse-oriented personal characteristics and preferences did not exhibit this moderating influence. Thus, our findings suggest that role occupation may be more important than locus of self in shaping students' susceptibility to beliefs about drinking and college life."
0,"This study applies advanced conceptualization and measurement to an analysis of acculturation among 1632 Mexican-heritage preadolescents. We assessed whether - and how - multiple measures combine to form a latent acculturation construct that groups individuals into classes; and determine how many and what classes (or types) of acculturation are experienced by this sample of 5th graders. Measures included attitudinal, behavioral, and linguistic acculturation, generation status, time in the US, ethnic identification, and contact with the culture of origin. The analysis identified five classes of acculturation, differing in size and characterized by specific measures of acculturation: less acculturated, moderately bicultural, strongly bicultural, highly acculturated, and marginalized. Although most youths fell into the first four classes, consonant with their exposure to American society, a small minority of youths fell into the last class. Despite substantial exposure to US culture and recent exposure to Mexican culture, these youth showed little affinity for either culture. "
0,"I find that despite the commonality of having parents living abroad, there are differences in experiences that lead some children of migrants to aspire to migrate, while others aspire to stay in their homeland.  Non-migrants who have achieved greater social status in their homeland perceive migration to the US as an automatic decrease in status and therefore not desirable.  On the other hand, members of transnational families who have been unable to achieve economic stability or upward mobility despite parents migration do aspire to migrate."
0,"I argue that economic globalization, indicated by the tremendous rise in world foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent decades, is not driven simply by investor considerations of economic risk and return, but is significantly shaped by the construction of demand for foreign capital by receiving states. States signal this demand through the levels of formal and substantive legitimacy they grant to FDI They institutionalize globalization in formal rule as a normatively desirable development strategy. States substantiate this commitment by providing domestic and foreign actors with ideational and organizational resources to facilitate FDI To illustrate this argument, I use the case of Central and Eastern Europe, which was large v closed to global capital before the collapse of Communism. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data show that substantive legitimacy granted to FDI by host states, more than formal regulations, determined the size of foreign capital flows into postsocialist countries in the first decade of market reform. These findings point to social foundations of macroeconomic trends beyond the re instrumental considerations of risk and return privileged in previous research."
0,"This study was an effort to test Kims (2001) Integrative Theory of Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation using data from 67 Bosnian refugees in St. Louis, Missouri, obtained from a pilot study of a larger project.  A convenience sample was used and the participants completed a self-reported questionnaire which measured host language competence, host and ethnic interpersonal relationships, host and ethnic media use, sociocultural adaptation, psychological health, ethnic and cultural identity salience, and demographics.  Correlation analyses were run to test 23 proposed hypotheses and two research questions.  The analyses revealed that host language competence was positively related to host media use, psychological health, and U.S. cultural identity salience.  While host media use was positively related to both ethnic media use and sociocultural adaptation, ethnic interpersonal relationships was positively related to psychological health.  Lastly, ethnic identity salience was positively related to U.S. cultural identity salience, psychological health, and sociocultural adaptation.  These findings suggest that host communication competence and host and ethnic social communication were used to serve different functions in the resettlement process of Bosnian refugees."
0,"This paper investigates Mexican immigrant incorporation by examining labor force participation and schooling among Mexican-origin adolescents in the United States. Theoretical perspectives on immigrant incorporation, labor migration-related cultural repertoires and adolescent development considered together imply that studying ethnoracial differences in schooling among adolescents without taking work into account can yield mis-leading pictures of Mexican-origin non-high school completion patterns, thus hampering the assessment of incorporation theories. To avoid this, we analyze Mexican-origin generational differences in the relationship between schooling and workforce participation among adolescents compared to non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Using micro-data from the 2000 US Census, we find that Mexican immigrant boys who are not enrolled in school are more likely to be in the workforce, and conversely that those who are enrolled in school are much less likely to be in the workforce, compared to whites and blacks. Such relative differences in school/work specialization, as predicted, diminish across Mexican-origin generations. Moreover, based on supplementary analyses, we find similar patterns for a cohort of young adults who failed to complete high school during the 1990s. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that cultural orientations growing out of the nature and experience of Mexican labor migration are important for assessing school enrollment patterns among Mexican-origin youth and for gauging their implications for educational policy and immigrant-group incorporation.

0,"This paper analyzes temporal variations in two gender attitudes in China: beliefs about gender equality and perspectives on women's combined work and family roles. It uses the most currently available population series from the 1995, 2001 and 2007 World Value Surveys of 4500 respondents and a series of multilevel cross-classified models to properly estimate period and cohort effects. Attitudes toward women's dual roles manifest neither period nor cohort effects; the population displays a universal high level of acceptance of women's paid employment. Orientations toward gender equality manifest both cohort and period effects: members of the youngest cohort of both sexes hold the most liberal attitudes; the positive effect of college education has increased over time. Attitude toward gender equality in China displays neither a shift toward conservatism nor an over-time trend toward egalitarianism in 1995-2007, a time of rapid economic growth.

0,"Using data from 7272 adolescent US girls, we explore how girls' race/ethnic group status affects their bodyweight, perceptions of overweight, and weight control practices. We hypothesize that a girl's race/ethnic status influences her basic identity which in turn prompts her to adopt or reject a ""drive for thinness."" After controlling for family and peer support, school engagement, family SES, maturation, and family structure, we find that girls' race/ethnic status influences their susceptibility to the thinness ideals of mainstream culture. African American girls weigh more than Asian. Hispanic, or White girls, but at any given weight they perceive themselves as overweight and attempt to control their weight less. Asian American and White girls invest most in thinness dynamics. Some evidence also suggests girls from lower SES families are less driven to be thin. Our results affirm the utility of viewing material bodies as ""situations"" that are experienced and interpreted in accord with identity group relations and dynamics. Published by Elsevier Inc."
0,"In response to the dramatic employment displacement brought about by economic restructuring, the Chinese state has engaged in a large scale, labor-retraining project to retool workers for the new economy. This paper considers this labor-retraining project as a state gender strategy for reconstructing the worth of devalued populations, particularly women workers. Specifically I examine how gendered labor capacities are created and legitimated. Field data from the two-month intensive Yunnan Province Womens Federation Beauty Skills Training Course for rural women reveals the institutionally structured, routinized, and practiced bodily routines promoted in training courses. The examination of a training course designed for women illuminates the ways in which emergent occupational divides are grounded in womens bodies. The resulting forms of embodiment sow the corporeal seeds of consent to insecure and low-waged gender-typed work."
0,"Does religious pluralism decrease religious participation or increase it? Secularization theorists claim the former, while religious economies proponents claim the latter, and each side has used estimated pluralism-participation correlations to support its argument. Using a formal game theoretic model, this article shows how religious market forces and regulations generate plausible pluralism-participation correlations, whether or not the direct causal mechanisms argued by either side of the debate exist. The model generates testable hypotheses concerning the pluralism-participation relationship at both local and national levels and yields insights into previous empirical work."
0,"To illuminate how race affects the usage of punitive tools in policy implementation settings, we analyze sanctions imposed for noncompliant client behavior under welfare reform. Drawing on a model of racial classification and policy choice, we test four hypotheses regarding client race, local context, and sanctioning. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional multilevel analyses of individual-level administrative data, we find that race plays a significant role in shaping sanction implementation. Its effects, however, are highly contingent on client characteristics, local political contexts, and the degree to which state governments devolve policy control to local officials."
0,"A pivotal idea in this paper is that prevailing notions of childhood have changed over time in the U.S.  Specifically, I show that changes have occurred in parent behaviors regarding cognitive development of their young children and argue the growing trend in the parenting of cognitive development in young children in the latter half of the 20th century is largely attributable to the institutionalization of mass schooling.  This paper examines parenting cognitive development from 1951 to 2001 in four ways.   First I briefly review three related literatures: 1) the sociological literature on changes in parenting in the U.S. during the 20th century; 2) the research literature on changes in the U.S. during the 20th century in expert literature to parents on cognitive development of children; and, 3) the research literature on parental involvement in schooling.  Next, I present analysis of data on parents from Patterns of Childrearing 1951-52, the Detroit Area Study 1963, and the National Household Education Surveys 1991 and 2001 to show the changes in parent behaviors around the cognitive development of their children in the U.S. in the 50 year span from 1951 to 2000.  Third, I demonstrate the changing impact of household income and mothers education as evidence of the overall influence of mass education on norms and behaviors of parents.    Finally, I describe the normative nature of parenting cognitive development by the beginning of the 21st century using the National Household Education Survey 1991, 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2001 and speculate on its implications for the sociologies of parenting and education, as well as a neo-institutional analysis of schooling.  The results show parents increasingly spend time more time engaging in activities related to cognitive development over the second half of the 20th century so that by 1991 it is normative behavior.  In addition, mothers education becomes an increasingly better predictor of parenting cognitive development over the latter half of the 20th century."
0,"Using data from the German social insurance system immigrant employment in organizational buffer zones will be investigated from an organizational ecology perspective. Theories in organization and labor market research predict higher exit rates of employees holding jobs in buffer zones. These buffer zones protect organizations from unfavorable environmental turbulences. Consequently, analyzing the impact of buffer zone employment on job stability of immigrants requires a fully dynamic approach, which goes beyond a mere identification of generally increased turnover rates of immigrants."
0,"If two contending candidate locations are fixed in some ideological space, and voters vote for the candidate closer to themselves, then the candidate whose policies are closer to a majority of the voters wins.  However, if voters make their choices based upon some single dimension rather than the whole space, then candidates can promote some  particular single dimension, what we call putting a spin on it.   We show that (except under some extreme special case conditions) there will always be some possible spins on which a majority of voters will favor even the most poorly placed candidate; i.e., we show that the possibility of spins always provides some hope for losers.  We show the potential importance of spins, by considering how strategically chosen spins might have worked in three recent real world U.S. presidential elections.  In general, we argue for a broadened concept of political competition that makes political persuasion about the basis of voter choice much more central for political outcomes."
0,"Occupational careers are usually modeled as continuous; however, most careers are not continuous, but, in fact, are characterized by periods of interruptions.  Although many careers have interruptions, interruptions are rarely integrated into models of occupational mobility and status attainment. Womens careers are more often marked by periods of interruptions, due to women greater propensity to be removed from the labor force for childcare and household responsibilities.  This paper examines gender differences in the whole range of occupational-career interruptions in Poland (a country that is currently undergoing radical social changes) and Sweden (the ideal welfare state).  The results of the analysis suggest that women more frequently experience interruptions and for longer periods of times than men in both Sweden and Poland.  There also appears to be a gendered nature to the interruptions with women and men experiencing different types of interruptions.  In Sweden, for both men and women wages are significantly lowered for an interruption while in Poland for both men and women, wages were not significantly lowered.  This suggests that in Poland, the type of interruption matters more than just being removed from the labor force.  Lastly, different types of interruptions were compared for men and women to see which interruptions had the largest impact on wages.  The results confirm that in Sweden, men and women experience interruptions similarly, although the magnitude of the penalty varies by interruption.  In Poland, there appears to be greater gender differences and not all interruptions lowered wages."
0,"Diversity has become a fashionable and plastic buzzword over the past thirty years. With the recent U.S. Supreme Court cases concerning affirmative action at the University of Michigan, the concept of diversity has received even greater public scrutiny. The existing scholarly literature that examines discourses about diversity usually relies on macro-level, legal, or text analyses, overlooking peoples interpretations of diversity in their everyday practices. The proposed paper helps to fill in this gap. It draws on over a year of ethnographic evidence about how interests groups involved in the lawsuits against UMincluding university administrators, pro- and anti-affirmative action activists, legal professionals, and political leaderspolitically and legally mobilized around the lawsuits and then responded to the Courts decisions. The paper builds on cultural analyses of the law and collective action by examining how various interest groups negotiate different socio-legal paradoxes around diversity. Preliminary findings show how nearly every group is in favor of diversity, but they all confront challenges when defining this concept and putting it into practice. For example, outsider activistsboth in favor of and opposed to affirmative actiontalk about diversity by simultaneously endorsing it and questioning its relevance, meaning, or existence. The proposed paper concludes with a discussion of how ideas related to law acquire constituencies, constitute the categories through which people construct the world, and ultimately shape their efforts to address different social problems."
0,"Sociologists who study emotions and mental health often examine similar concepts and processes, and sometimes employ similar methodologies. However, few attempts have been made to delineate potential sources of synergy in the theoretical and empirical perspectives that each brings to bear on the study of emotional well-being. Our paper focuses special attention on anger, drawing upon the sociology of emotions literature to frame anger as a social emotion. Then, we survey literature in the sociology of mental health in order to illustrate the role of anger in stress processes. One of our central aims is to extend the research focus beyond anger as simply another outcome in the stress process to its potential role as a mediating and moderating condition. In doing so, we attempt to integrate core themes from sociology of emotions research to inform and develop our arguments."
0,"When viewed through the lens of organizational sociology, American county fairs are an odd hybrid.  Though both participants and observers understand fairs as products of tradition and community, these organizations must nevertheless comply with a complex set of formal bureaucratic rules.  Both organizational modestradition and bureaucracy work in tandem to lend the organization a familiar and stable form. Though institutionalists have long acknowledged dual sets of norms within formal organizations, this paper pushes their work further, and squarely into the realm of cultural sociology.  I argue that in societies dominated by bureaucratic organizations, the complementarity of bureaucratic and informal, affective norms facilitate the perpetuation of practices we understand as traditions in late modernity. I base my conclusions on over 200 hours of participant observation at county and district fairs in Southern California. As volunteers collect the work of fair exhibitors they transform everyday domestic objects such as pies, preserves or polyanthas, into objects recognizable by a bureaucratic organization. The requirements of the fair organization and statewide fair bureaucracy lend purpose to interactions between volunteers and exhibitors as these objects are collected.  At the same time, informal norms of decency and graciousness lend the interactions a distinct quality, and this quality proves rewarding for the volunteers (as they claim, ""You meet such nice people"").  I argue that a combination of bureaucratic form and carefully maintained norms of association not only facilitates the fairs annual reproduction, but together constitute what regular participants understand as the events ""traditional"" quality."
0,"In the 2006 American Community Survey (ACS), 6% of respondents with Latin American ancestry answered 'no' when asked whether they were Hispanic themselves. Conventional definitions of the Hispanic population exclude such respondents as 'not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino' even though they are self-identified Latin American descendants. Since their exclusion may bias our assessments of Hispanic social mobility, it is important to know more about them. Non-Hispanic identification is most common among Latin American descendants who (1) list both Latin American and non-Latin American ancestries, (2) speak only English, and (3) identify as White, Black, or Asian when asked about their 'race.' Ancestry and racial identity are considerably more influential than respondents' education, income, place of birth, or place of residence. These findings support both traditional straight-line assimilation and a more recent ""racialized assimilation"" theory in explaining discrepant responses to the ethnicity and ancestry questions among Latin American descendants.

0,"Recent evidence indicates that contrary to some criminological theories, immigrants are less violent than native-born Americans. The relationship between immigrant status and reduced violence appears to hold at both the individual and neighborhood levels of analysis. This phenomenon has been referred to as the immigrant or Latino paradox. It has been suggested, although rarely examined, that cultural differences and strong social networks among immigrants account for their lower violence rates. These factors even appear strong enough to counterbalance the crime-promoting effects of economic disadvantage. This study investigates whether such patterns extend to intimate partner violence. Consistent with research on other forms of violence, we find that neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower levels of intimate partner violence. This relationship appears to be partially mediated by cultural norms and social ties."
0,"Research has examined racial/ethnic disparities in health care among various minority groups, but Asian Americans remain understudied population. Hmong individuals, particularly, may face sociocultural barriers to health care. Using administrative and survey data, we examine the cumulative effects of depression—an established barrier to effective health care—and provider discrimination—a prominent barrier among racial/ethnic minorities—on unmet need among 869 Hmong enrollees of Minnesota public health care programs. We find low-to-moderate prevalence of depression (13 percent) and discrimination (39 percent); notably, 58 percent reported provider linguistic/cultural barriers (a key control variable). Logistic regression, controlling for cultural barriers, nativism, and demographics, indicated that depression and discrimination independently predicted greater unmet need/delayed care. Nativism and child status had the opposite effect. Post-estimation, predicted probabilities showed that individuals without depression or discrimination had a 9 percent chance of unmet need/delayed care; depressed individuals experiencing discrimination had a 27 percent chance. Findings suggest that discrimination’s disruption of care is not mediated by mental health; rather, the two operate incrementally. Far from reflecting cultural barriers among Hmong individuals, these represent points of additional complexity. The effects of child status and nativism suggest that differences in public coverage create enduring need for non-native, adult enrollees."
0,"It may be premature to think that contemporary families are egalitarian because wives are working more and fathers are more involved with children. This research contends that egalitarianism is reflected in gender similarity in missing work to attend to children's needs. Drawing from two national surveys of dual-earner parents, familial factors (especially children and spouses work hours) exceeded job-related factors in determining women's sole provision of urgent childcare. Although mend egalitarian ideology was positively associated with urgent-childcare provision, men as a whole were less likely than women to adapt their work efforts to familial demands. These findings suggest more persistent traditionalism than progress toward egalitarianism in work-family role performance. The implications of these results for future research were briefly discussed."
0,"This paper reviews prior work on the media and discusses two approaches.  The first focuses primarily on the content of media and assumes that children passively consume such content.  In this view the media directly affects children (positively or negatively).  In the second approach children are seen as active agents who appropriate and use media content in their lives.  This paper extends prior research in line with the second approach as children as active consumers, by focusing on children spontaneous references and uses of media in their peer cultures in preschool and elementary school settings in the United States and Italy.  The study find that children have complex knowledge of the media, use it in their collective peer routines, and that the use of media can contribute to childrens development of literacy."
0,"This paper provides an examination of womens role in serial killing teams.  It reconsiders the traditional applications of radical feminist research on serial killers.  Radical feminists situate essentialism as a central tenet of their theoretical approach, which limits the utility of the theory for application to female serial killers.  This paper argues that an analysis of patriarchal power relations, which emphasizes the constitutive element of radical feminist theory, can provide a useful framework to achieve insight into female team serial killers.  The paper demonstrates the utility of this approach through two case studies of female serial killers who killed in killing teams, Karla Homolka and Myra Hindley."
0,"Despite diverse understandings of cosmopolitanism, most authors agree that cosmopolitans espouse a broadly defined disposition of openness toward others, displayed in cultural, political or aesthetic domains. It is argued that such an attitude is expressed by an emotional and ethical commitment towards universalism, selflessness, worldliness and communitarianism. Using qualitative focus group data to investigate the basis of such values of openness, this paper proposes the development of a category labelled strategic cosmopolitanism. The participants in this qualitative study saw themselves as conscious beneficiaries of an increasingly interconnected world and its economic and cultural prospects. They generally expressed cosmopolitan sentiments by referring to easily accepted opportunities associated with globalisation (eg. travel, cuisine, music) rather than the more difficult aspects of openness such as showing hospitality to strangers, or accepting human interest ahead of perceived national interests. These views were clearly counterbalanced, however, by sentiments of fear of dilution of national culture and culture loss. We argue that cosmopolitanism is a cultural repertoire, a set of discursive, practical resources available to social actors which is variably deployed to deal with emergent agendas and issues, related to things like cultural diversity, the global, and otherness."

0,"This paper examines the factors associated with the tempo of low-income couples relationship progression into sexual involvement and coresidence. Data come from a recently-collected survey, the Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS) that obtained information from low- to moderate-income married and cohabiting couples. Over one-fifth of male and female respondents reported becoming sexually involved with their current partner within the first week of dating. Entrance into shared living was also quite rapid; about one-third of respondents moved in with their partner within 6 months. Furthermore, about two-thirds of married respondents initially cohabited with their partners. Indicators of family disadvantage accelerated entrance into sexual involvement and coresidence; these effects are more pronounced for women than men. Our results also suggest that the pace of relationship progression, into sexual involvement as well as shared living, has accelerated among unions formed more recently. "
0,"An efflorescence of contemporary scholarship on Tocquevillian associations tends to focus on their role in increasing 'social capital' within civil society. There is a strong case that this reading mischaracterizes both Tocqueville and forms of association that challenge the status quo. This essay aims to move beyond the communitarian versus liberal debate around the Tocquevillian legacy by connecting it to a more inherently sociological dynamic: the form and function of the associations themselves and their subsequent impact. Case-studies of three community organizations provide insight into the different associational models, organizational goals and public-facing modes of self-presentation pursued by each group. With Elisabeth Clemens work on the organizational form as frame in mind, this investigation asks why these organizations choose to organize in a particular manner, and what happens when they do. It also raises a number of critical questions for further investigation and suggests several avenues for additional inquiry."

0,"In this analysis I examine the spread of Internet Distance Learning (IDL) for graduate education among institutions of higher education.  I posit that IDL is a controversial innovation and thus follows a different pattern of diffusion than the typical pattern described by neoinstitutionalist arguments.  I propose a new theory, Status Contingent Diffusion Theory, which argues that the spread of a controversial innovation is affected by both the status of the organization and the current routines of the organization.  I argue that lower status organizations will adopt IDL first and for a wide range of purposes, while high status organizations will be reluctant to adopt IDL and if they do so will limit the way they offer IDL.  I test this argument with data from U.S. News and World Report and Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS).  The argument proposed by Status Contingent Diffusion Theory is supported by these data."

Previous research has demonstrated that these processes engender powerful emotions that have important implications for group solidarity. We investigate whether these emotional reactions also generate “structural strain” that results in feelings of alienation and detachment from the exchange relation and subsequent deviance. We offer a theory of the joint effects of power use and justice sentiments on rule violation. This integrative theory generates derivations that are amenable to testing in a laboratory setting. Our principal derivation argues that power use and perceptions of injustice generate deviance through strain produced by detachment from the exchange relationship. These ideas capture parallel arguments found in prominent criminological theories.
0,"This article examines how lesbian, gay, and straight-but-affirming members of lesbian- and gay-affirming churches in the South challenged a deep-rooted Christian belief in homosexual sin. Data are taken from 200 hours of participant observation and 25 in-depth interviews in two Protestant churches: one predominantly black, working class, lesbian, and evangelical, and the other mostly white, middle class, heterosexual, and liberal. I identify three strategies lesbian, gay, and straight-but-affirming church members used to accommodate-but not assimilate-to heteronormative conceptions of the ""good Christian."" First, some black lesbians minimized their sexuality as secondary to the Christian identity. Second, most lesbian and gay members-both black and white-normalized their sexuality by enacting Christian morals of monogamy, manhood, and motherhood. Third, a small group of black lesbian/gay and white, straight-but-affirming members moralized their sexuality as grounds for challenging homophobia in the church. Using these strategies, church members both resisted notions of homosexual sin and reproduced a ""politics of respectability"" (Warner 1999) among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Findings shed empirical light on two issues in the social problems literature: (1) the inseparability of race and gender from sexual identity; and (2) the importance of an intersectional analysis in assessing the possibilities of faith-based strategies for sexual equality."
0,"In keeping with the 2011 PSA meeting's theme, ""Sociologists as Claims Makers: Turning Theory Into Action,"" the presidential address reported research findings (scientific sociology) that were accompanied by a documentary that represented the research results (applied sociology). Guided by a social constructionist perspective, findings from five studies were organized into seven themes to demonstrate the problems domestic violence victims, or protective parents, encounter when their abusers entangle them in contested custody battles. The documentary shown in the presidential address can be viewed in this article by connecting to a link provided. It is noted that the focus of the research and documentary remain at the social issue level-a phenomenon that exists in society, but has not yet been defined as a social problem. It is argued that the problems identified in the research are affecting many thousands of domestic violence victims and their children, yet the issue has received minimal attention in the discipline of sociology."
0,"Bullying is an important social problem that occurs within a bounded social setting. As such, it is best understood by analyzing the social dynamics that produce and sustain it. However, previous research has tended to view bullying as a manifestation of personal pathology or amorphous characteristics of contexts. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by applying the construct of collective efficacy to account for variations in the frequency of bullying perpetration within schools. Just as collective efficacy provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the dynamics of bullying in schools, these settings also provide an ideal social context for testing collective efficacy theory. The reason is that schools are clearly defined contexts with regular, ongoing social interactions among students, teachers, school staff and administrators. In the present study, both lagged cross-sectional (LCS) models and fall-to-spring change (FSC) models were estimated to determine the empirical relations between student perceptions of collective efficacy and bullying perpetration, using data collected from 7,299 youth in fifth, eighth, and eleventh grades in 78 schools. Two key results were found: (1) perceptions of collective efficacy were negatively, significantly, and substantially associated with the frequency of bullying perpetration within schools over time, and (2) of the three components of collective efficacy (cohesion and trust, informal social control by adults, informal social control by peers) identified in a principal components factor analysis, cohesion and trust had the strongest estimated effects in all models estimated. Findings suggest that collective efficacy theory can provide a useful framework for capturing important dynamics of bullying in schools with important implications for prevention and intervention."
0,"How does disability onset affect social activities in late life? The relationship between disability and social activities is examined longitudinally rather than cross-sectionally, and specific social activities are examined rather than limited to overall social activity levels. While participation in some activities may decrease, participation in other activities may increase or be substituted for these activities. What kind of accommodation in social activities is observed? I analyze the 1994-2000 Second Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA II), of which three waves of data were collected (baseline interviews were in-person and follow-up interviews were by telephone). The sample is nationally representative of the noninstitutionalized, age 70 and older, population in the U.S. (n = 4,323). Disability onset decreases subsequent social activity levels measured at the first follow-up interview. As for specific social activities, disability onset is associated with a decrease in all social activities examined except for no change in getting together with relatives. Also, before controls are added, disability onset is associated with an increase in getting together with friends and neighbors, but this relationship disappears when controls are added. Future revisions of this paper will analyze mediating variables as well as social activity levels measured at the second follow-up interview to see if any adaptation to disability and restoration of activity levels occurs."
0,"Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare are widespread, but most analyses focus on the characteristics of individuals rather than considering whether disparities also operate at the level of organizations. This research considers whether the racial/ethnic caseload composition within addiction treatment centers is associated with the likelihood that the center offers pharmacotherapies for addiction. Using data collected in 2002-2003 from 362 publicly funded and 401 privately funded specialty substance abuse treatment centers in the US, logistic regression models were used to estimate models of naltrexone adoption, disulfiram adoption, and agonist medication adoption. For the models of naltrexone and disulfiram adoption, there were significant negative associations between the percentage of minority clients and the adoption these medications, net of other organizational characteristics. However, the association between minority clients and agonist medication adoption was not significant. These data highlight the importance of studying racial disparities at the level of addiction treatment organizations in order to improve the quality of care delivered in these settings."
0,Studies of health inequalities consistently find neighborhood and network effects.  But the mechanisms that may account for these contextual effects remain relatively unknown.  This paper uses arguments about trust and trusting relations developed in the social capital literature to (1) build a case for trust as one mechanism that accounts for the effects of neighborhood disorder and network capital on depression and (2) develop the argument that trust is more important in underclass areas.  We find that trust mediates the association of neighborhood disorder and depression but not the association of network capital and depression.  We also find that support is more important in underclass areas.  We conclude by exploring the implications of these findings for future research on mechanisms to account for neighborhood and network effects.
0,"This study investigates ethnic outgroup feelings from a multigroup perspective. We test predictions from the similarity principle and intergroup contact theory, claiming that people are more positive towards similar others and that outgroup exposure leads to outgroup attraction. Multilevel analyses on dyadic ingroup-outgroup pairs gathered from a Dutch survey on four ethnic minority groups show that similarity (especially in group characteristics) positively affects favorable outgroup feelings. Outgroup exposure has a non-linear, reversed U-shape effect: a growing share of an ethnic outgroup in the neighborhood of residence initially increases favorable outgroup feelings, yet when the ethnic outgroup is large, further growth decreases favorable feelings. We also find a similarity by contact interaction, such that when group similarity is high, outgroup exposure generates more favorable feelings. The latter finding integrates two rather separate research fields and supports the equal status condition from intergroup contact theory. "
0,"Political-economic sociologists have long investigated the dynamics and consequences of international trade.  With few exceptions, this area of inquiry ignores the possible connections between trade and environmental degradation.  In contrast, environmental sociologists have made several assumptions about the environmental impacts of international trade, but the assumptions lack theoretical specificity and are thus empirically under-investigated.  Bridging these two complementary areas of macrosociology, the present study proposes and tests a structural theory of unequal ecological exchange.  The theory posits that more-developed countries externalize their consumption-based environmental costs to less-developed countries, which increase forms of environmental degradation within the latter.  To test a key assertion of the theory, a weighted index of vertical trade is created that quantifies the relative extent to which exports are sent to more-developed countries.  Using the index, cross-national panel analyses of deforestation, 1990-2000 are conducted to test the hypothesis that less-developed countries with higher levels of exports sent to more-developed countries experience greater rates of deforestation, net of other factors.  Results of the analyses confirm the hypothesis, providing support for the theory of uneven ecological exchange.  Additional findings correspond with other sociological studies of deforestation, particularly those that focus on the effects of rural and urban population growth as well as level of capital intensity and rate of economic development."
0,"Part of the dilemma in addressing mental illness in the media surrounds the diverse and scattered disciplinary efforts.  In this presentation, we present a first effort to bring together theory and methods from sociology (prejudice, social network contacts, and survey research) and cognitive psychology/communications research (retention; physiological, cognitive and emotional effects, and experiments).  We target the underlying roots of stigma and propose an integrated approach to guide future studies which combines a content analysis of television, with an analysis of effects on individuals and efforts directed to individual change."
0,"Over the past 50 years, women roles have changed dramatically-a reality captured by substantial increases in employment and reductions infertility. Yet, the social organization of work and family life has not changed much, leading to pervasive work-family conflict. Observing these strains, some scholars wonder whether US. women high employment levels are sustainable. Women employment in professional and managerial occupations-the core of the analyses offered in this article-merits particular interest because of the material and symbolic implications for gender equality. In a cohort analysis of working-age women born between 1906 and 1975, I show that employment levels among college-educated women in professional and managerial occupations have increased across cohorts. Full-time, year-round employment rates continue to rise across cohorts, even among women in historically male professions and mothers of young children. Although labor force participation rates have stopped rising, they have stalled at a very high rate, with less than 8 percent Of professional women born since 1956 out of the labor force for a year or more during their prime childbearing years. Moreover the difference in employment rates between mothers and childless women-the ""child penalty"" -is shrinking across cohorts."
0,"Using data from a 2005 nationally representative survey of working adults residing in the United States, we show that education is associated positively with a sense of personal control. The well-educated have higher status occupations which include higher levels of schedule control, challenging, interesting and enriching work, greater economic rewards and security, and a higher level of trust. Collectively, these patterns contribute substantially to the association between education and sense of control. We also observe that demanding work has a negative effect on sense of control, but this emerges only after adjusting for other higher status work conditions that correspond with demands. Our observations inform the integration of theoretical perspectives to describe education benefits for personal and social functioning."
0,"We live in a crisis prone era. The most recent global financial and food crises have disproportionately impacted those already marginalized in society: people of color and the working classes. The spatial expressions of this disproportionality are especially acute, evidenced by the uneven distribution of the basic necessities of food and home.  Activists in the United States are responding to these spatial challenges in a distinctly spatial way by reclaiming public spaces by exercising their constitutional right to peaceably assemble. During the process of creating spaces of dissent we observe the formation of a spatialized identity among social movement actors.  We use two cases based in Florida to highlight these processes. The first case involves Food Not Bombs (FNB) in the city of Orlando where attempts were made to ban the group from distributing food in public parks to the homeless and working poor. The second case is a local iteration of the Occupy Wall Street protests, Occupy Gainesville (OG), which has occupied the city’s most central public gathering place, the Bo Diddley Community Plaza.  These case highlight the spatiotemporal relationships between unjust economic systems and those resisting such systems while also showing how collective identity influences, and in turn is influenced by space.  We conclude by arguing for the continued integration of spatial considerations into social movement research."
0,"Within modern, liberal democratic social formations, similitude is, and has historically been, aggressively enforced at the same time as inclusivity and the acceptance of difference has remained a central claim. This contradiction will be interrogated using the work of Pierre Clastres and Marcel Gauchet. Both authors suggest that groups cohere around ideals that are symbolically represented and identified with by group members. These representations can be epistemologically situated vis-à-vis the group in a variety of ways with important repercussions for the social and political life of the group. Gauchet argues that the emergence of the state cannot be understood outside of the process of disenchantment characterized as the return of the religious Other to the world, and the resulting gradual demise of religion. While the advent of liberal democracy is to some extent represented by Gauchet as the culmination of this event, it is not a glorious climax. Rather, even as universalized ideals around which groups cohere are disavowed in the name of self realization, the self is to be realized within conditions of freedom and autonomy that must be strictly enforced and universally recognized. Thus, for Gauchet, the diminution of religion has given rise to the deeply fractured and pathologized self upon which liberal democratic societies are based."
0,"Our study extends research on the feminization of poverty by analyzing the variation in women's, men's, and feminized poverty across affluent democracies from 1969 to 2000. Specifically, we address three issues. First, we provide more recent estimates of adult women's and men's poverty and the ratio of women's to men's poverty with two different poverty measures. We suggest that by incorporating the elderly, the feminization of poverty may be greater than previously estimated. The feminization of poverty is nearly universal across affluent Western democracies 1969-2000. Second, we show that women's, men's and overall poverty are highly correlated, but the feminization of poverty diverges as a distinct social problem. Third, we find that women's, men's and overall poverty share several correlates, particularly the welfare state, though some differences exist. At the same time, several of our findings differ with past research. The feminization of poverty is only influenced by social security transfers, single motherhood and the sex ratios of the elderly and labor force participation. While power resources theory probably best explains women's, men's and overall poverty, structural theory may best explain the feminization of poverty. We conclude by discussing how analyses of the feminization of poverty contribute to debates on poverty and gender inequality. "
0,"This analysis combines results and models from prior analyses of ecological effects on educational outcomes to specify a comprehensive path model estimated separately for male and female respondents to the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen. We find that males are exposed to higher levels of violence and disorder than females, and that the gender gap in such exposure grows as the ecological concentration of minority group members increases. At the same time, however, ecological effects on academic performance appear to be stronger for females than males. In the rare cases where females are exposed to high levels of disorder and violence, the effects on college grades are quite large. Nonetheless, relatively few females experience high exposure to violence and social disorder, and, as a result, male grades are more influenced by the ecological disadvantage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"The purpose of this paper is to determine how the collective memories of a baseball player’s contributions to his sport change posthumously.  That is, we seek to examine if levels of veneration accorded to an athlete depends on whether he is alive or deceased, the timing of his death, and type of death he experienced. Building upon theories of cultural valorization, we propose that our collective efforts to remember retired athletes are greater if those athletes have passed on; that is, collective memory augments lifetime achievement in the consecration of individuals.  Specifically, we analyze the history of voting conducted by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) on players eligible for induction to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.  The results suggest that a variety of variables such as performance and recognition measures affect the amount of votes a player receives. However, dying exerts a powerful influence on votes received toward entry into the National Baseball Hall of Fame by hitters but not pitchers, offering partial support for our propositions."
0,"Although the past decade has witnessed increased usage of ecological data to map the community-level effects of religion, the vast majority of studies in this body of scholarship continue to be plagued by two key shortcomings. First, ecological research on religion is often conducted in an atheoretical manner, one that privileges the structural character of religion while failing to demonstrate sensitivity to the substance Of collectively held religious beliefs and values. Second, ecological scholarship Often employs crude methodological techniques that overlook noteworthy distinctions within large religious collectivities (e.g., variants Of conservative Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism). This study charts new theoretical and methodological directions in the use of ecological data by exploring the complex linkages between religious ecology and mortality in the United States. We hypothesize that the other-worldly theology and individualistic orientation found in conservative Protestantism dampens this faith traditions commitment to population health, thereby leading to demonstrably different outcomes in mortality by denominational families. Also, drawing on previous work that criticizes the ""monolithic bloc"" depiction Of conservative Protestantism, we hypothesize that important distinctions in mortality will be found when sub-groups of conservative Protestants (evangelicals, Pentecostals and fundamentalists) are compared because each of these factions exhibits distinct degrees of other-worldliness. Using restricted county-level data from the National Center for Health Statistics and 2000 Churches and Church Congregations data, we observe noteworthy religious differences in mortality, thereby underscoring a need for the development of more sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches to the ecological study of religion. Ecological researchers are encouraged to take seriously the content of collectively held religious beliefs and exhibit sensitivity toward the distinctive worldviews that hold sway within particular faith traditions."
0,"Research shows that those with greater social capital enjoy better physical and mental health. The current study illuminates a paradox of social capital which may afflict those involved in traumatic events. Several years of survey data reveal a dynamic picture of the link between social capital and stress following Hurricane Katrina. Results reveal that initially after Katrina, those who were more socially embedded carried the greatest load with respect to helping the displaced population, thus experiencing more stress. But over time, the most socially-involved then snapped back from their stressful experiences more rapidly than isolates. This confirms that over the course of stressful events, social involvement first exposes people to more stress, but as time passes, provides them a significant buffer against negative psychosocial experiences.

0,"The pattern of hires among graduate departments shows a clear hierarchy, with a few departments supplying a large share of the faculty.  This paper analyzes the relationship between department of origin and employing department of sociology in 1965, 1983, and 2007.  It considers two primary issues:  (1) the overall distribution of the number of placements by different departments and (2) the stability of individual rankings.  On the first point, a small number of departments provide a large fraction of the faculty at other graduate departments, especially at the more prominent ones.  However, the degree of dominance by the leading institutions declined between 1965 and 2007.  On the second point, there is a high degree of stability, but no evidence of a long-term ""memory""--that is, controlling for 1983 ranking, 1965 ranking did not have a significant effect on current ranking."
0,"Drawing on three years of participant observation in a Liberian immigrant community, this article examines the role of legal refugee status in immigrants' daily encounters with the state. Using the literature on immigrant incorporation, claims making, and citizenship, it argues that refugee status profoundly shapes individuals' views and expectations of their host government as well as their interactions with the medical, educational, and social service institutions they encounter. The refugees in this study use their refugee status to make claims for legal and social citizenship and to distance themselves from native-born blacks. In doing so, they validate their own position vis-a-vis the state and in the American ethno-racial hierarchy. The findings presented demonstrate how refugee status operates as a symbolic and interpretive resource used to negotiate the structural realities of the welfare state and American race relations. These results stress the importance of studying immigrant incorporation from a micro perspective and suggest mechanisms for the adaptational advantages for refugees reported in existing research."
0,"We ask whether ethnic residential segregation influences the future educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden. We use a dataset comprising a cohort of children who finished compulsory school in 1995 (n = 6,560). We follow these children retrospectively to 1990 to measure neighborhood characteristics during late childhood, and prospectively through 2003 to measure the number of years of education attained thus far. The largest immigrant groups came from Finland, Turkey, former Yugoslavia, Iran and Chile. Our empirical analysis reveals that immigrant children who grow up in neighborhoods with many young coethnics who have limited educational resources, obtain relatively low average grades from compulsory school, and on average, do not attain the same levels of education as do immigrant children who grow up elsewhere. For a minority of immigrant children who lived in neighborhoods with educationally successful young coethnics, we find a positive effect of growing up in an ethnic enclave. Also in this case, the effect of the ethnic environment on future educational attainment is mediated by school results in compulsory school."

After the Boston Globe broke the story about John Geoghan - a priest in the Boston Archdiocese who was accused of abusing numerous children, convicted of one count of indecent assault, and eventually murdered in prison - the Church had many questions to answer. To this end, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) commissioned John Jay College of Criminal Justice to research the nature and scope, as well as the causes and context of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church."
0,"Theories of political sociology do not often include the media as an important factor in analyzing political outcomes.  While the media are a complicated organization of interests, they operate as political actors and have positive and negative impacts on outcomes.  The media have a somewhat contradictory basis of production and signification that is oblique to other political interests.  The media are partisan but their interests are based on presenting entertaining and even shocking reports on politics.  The media's political power is inherently bound up in the reporter's ability to create, frame, and broadcast hews in presenting political regimes.  In the face of the media's political power, executive administration and political candidates engage in long-and short term bargains that structure how politicians interact wtiht the media.  This bargain varies from administration to administration, but they have many of the same elements involved in their negotiations.  Overtime, political organizations become isomorphic with the meida in order to facilitate these bargains.  Thus, the institutionalized power of the media comes about from the varied power resources and valued alternatives of both the media and the politicians.  The paper provides examples from the Bush-Media bargain."
0,"Besides reducing overall smoking prevalence, do anti-tobacco policies to raise prices and restrict locations for smoking also reduce educational disparities? Theories emphasizing proximate disincentives answers yes, suggesting that the policy changes create stronger disincentives for smoking among low education groups. A social resource or fundamental cause theory suggests in contrast that flexible and broad resource advantages of high education groups maintain inequalities in health behavior despite policy changes. Using 24 National Health Interview Surveys, this study tests these claims by describing smoking prevalence by education level from 1976 to 2006 in the United States and giving special attention to the last ten years when tax and clean-air policies have expanded. Logistic regression models that allow trends in smoking to vary by education, race, ethnicity, and nativity find a small decline in educational disparities in smoking. However, this decline stemmed from trends among Hispanic and foreign-born respondents; in contrast, smoking disparities among white, African American, and native-born respondents show no evidence of narrowing. Likely due to the greater resources of high education groups for health behavior, changes in prices and restrictions thus far have done little to reduce educational disparities."
0,"Recent disasters have been of such scale and complexity that both the common assumptions made about learning from them, and the traditional approaches distinguishing natural from technological disasters (and now terrorism) are thus challenged. Beck's risk thesis likewise signals the need for a, paradigmatic change. Despite sociological inflections in disaster research and management, however, an examination of the risk ""management practices deployed during Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami reveals attendant problems with a persistent instrumental rationality and disjuncture between society and environment. Therefore, an alternative, post-social understanding is proposed. It includes relational (rather than instrumental) approaches which reinstate the importance of nonhuman nature, but it also recognizes that disasters are post-normal problems, and that disaster research and management increasingly deal with phenomena beyond the limits of current know-how"
0,"Generalized trust varies across individuals and countries. Past studies on trust have demonstrated that voluntary association membership, inequality and ethnic homogeneity at country level are important. However, those studies examined either individual-level or country-level factors separately. In this paper, we conceptualized the emergence of generalized trust as a multilevel process in which the effects of individual-level attributes are influenced by social contexts. Using a multilevel modeling approach on World Values Survey in 48 countries, we estimated a cross-level interaction between voluntary association membership at individual level and income inequality and ethnic homogeneity as two types of social cleavages at country level. We found that the positive effect of voluntary association membership decreases with the level of income inequality."
0,"This paper examines the professional experiences of nine Black faculty members at a predominately white Research I institution.  Through in-depth interviews using ethnographic research methods, I examine aspects of emotional labor that exist for Black faculty in the academy in addressing the expectations of their institution, colleagues, students and communities.  My most significant finding was that there are generational differences of opinion between the senior cohort (professors in their 50s and 60s) and the junior cohort (professors in their 30s).  The generational differences of opinion were most profound firstly in terms of how faculty members define their community and secondly in the way in which they choose to fulfill their obligation to their community.  I argue that the generational differences of opinion among faculty members are attributed to the historical moment in which they came of age.  However, regardless of these generational differences, Black faculty hold a commitment to promote social change, whether that be in the classroom or within the community."
0,"Despite over 100 years of a widening differential between mens and womens death rates, recent studies have shown that the gap is now narrowing in a large number of countries throughout the developed world.  This study examines the effect of gender equality on this convergence in the mortality rates between the sexes.  Using the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), I study the effect of gender equality on the sex mortality ratios for different age groups and causes of death in 45 countries around the world.  My findings indicate that higher levels of national gender equality are associated with a smaller differential between male and female mortality rates.  Ultimately, the study concludes that the narrowing differential is due to the greater effect of gender equality on male mortality rather than on female mortality."
0,"Fashion trend forecasting companies offers their customers a way to reduce uncertainty in a field characterized by change (or neomania), the fashion field. This paper asks how fashion trend forecasting companies legitimize themselves in the field of fashion. The study is based on 25 interviews with employees of fashion trend forecasting companies in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo, both online subscription-based ones and publication-based ones. As a cultural production field, the fashion field has two parallel but competing principles of legitimacy (an economic and a cultural/symbolic one). Because of the high value placed on design, designers, and creativity, the fashion forecasting companies must be careful not to interfere with the dominant ideas about fashion and creativity. Thus, they tend to present their services as “inspirational” rather than “directive”, and they claim that they do not affect trends, they just channel trends. However, many firms stress their fashion capital. It is common to have confidentiality agreements with customers who wish not to disclose the use trend services.  Many trend forecasters admit there is a tendency towards self-fulfilling prophecies. This kind of legitimacy is only recognized backstage, for most of the time the fashion trend forecasters need to downplay their actorhood."

However, the extent to which countries comply with the norms promoted and codified by environmental organizations and treaties has been less rigorously tested.

Here, I address the relationship between stated environmental objectives and practices and integrate world society and world-systems perspectives on the natural environment. Using random effects regression analyses of cross-national chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, I find that integration into world culture significantly predicts overall decreased use of these environmentally harmful products. However, the effect varies by zone of the world system, which supports an integrated theory of global environmentalism."
0,"According to classic and contemporary social theory, the community is crucial to how individuals respond to the onset of health problems. Cultural response to symptoms provides the foundation for lay diagnosis; offers a gauge for marking individual and societal health literacy; and reflects the cultural embeddedness of modern medical knowledge. Using data from the Stigma in Global Context – Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) on the recognition of schizophrenia from vignettes describing individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria, we examine the nature and correlates of lay diagnosis. Focusing on Western societies in the SGC-MHS, we ask three questions regarding problem recognition in Bulgaria (N=236), Cyprus (N=226), Germany (N=390), Hungary (N=345), Iceland (N=293), Spain (N=327), Great Britain (N=291), and the United States (N=443): What is the cross-national variation in recognition of mental illness? Is lay diagnosis associated with individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics and/or their evaluation of underlying causes?  Do lay diagnoses shape the nature and direction of the illness career? We find lay diagnosis of “mental illness” to be high across these Western nations with some, though modest, difference across countries. Variation for the more specific diagnosis of “schizophrenia” is greater though fairly consistent in country ordering. Lay diagnoses are shaped most consistently by attributions, inconsistently by socio-demographics, and, in turn, associated with respondents’ treatment recommendations and expected outcomes. In light of assumptions about public beliefs and knowledge that often underlie research, community efforts, clinical programs, and health policy, these findings suggest that a greater understanding of the complexities of lay diagnosis is warranted."
0,"Existing theories of social movement participation elaborate important mechanisms and processes but cannot reliably predict or account for participation or non-participation in movements, because they generally ignore the sociohistorical contexts of participation decisions.  This paper sketches an alternative approach to studying participation in movements that examines how movement actors succeed or fail in their attempts to solve problems posed by specific contexts of mobilization.  Toward that end, the paper compares participation in four union organizing campaigns that took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the late 1990s, demonstrating that the kinds of general mechanisms and processes social movement theorists have elaborated cannot account for the divergent outcomes of these four cases.  It is argued instead that participation outcomes in these four episodes of mobilization can only be understood by examining how the activists involved solved  or failed to solve  the problems posed by legacies of business unionism  the specific sociohistorical context of these two pairs of mobilization attempts."
0,"American parents of children adopted from China frequently consume Chinese cultural objects for display in their homes.  While they defend this consumption and display as an effort to validate their childrens ethno-cultural origins, parents also reveal that it signifies and solidifies their own identifications with Chinese culture.  As part of a larger research project examining China adoptive parents evolving Chinese identities, this paper asks: Which parents exhibit their familys Chineseness in this way, and why?   Through semi-structured in-depth interviews with ninety-one Americans in the China adoption process, I focus on the emergent and personal meanings that parents give to Chinese cultural objects; demonstrating how these meanings both structure parents consumption and yield a display differential.  In doing so, I reveal that White European-parents and mothers are most likely to engage in this consumption and display; thereby, amending the three types of ethno-cultural identity consumption represented in the literature.  Specifically, I expose the central role of race in ethno-cultural identity consumption; specify that the collective category of reference for ethno-cultural identity consumption is not always an ethnic category; and illustrate the ways in which global ethno-cultural identity consumption both appeals to and satisfies distinctly local constructs."
0,"Rational choice approaches to reducing terrorist violence would suggest raising the costs of terrorism through punishment, thereby reducing the overall expected utility of terrorism. In this article, we argue that states should also consider raising the expected utility of abstaining from terrorism through rewards. We test effects of repressive (or punishing) and conciliatory (or rewarding) actions on terrorist behavior using the newly developed GATE-Israel dataset, which identifies events by Israeli state actors toward Palestinian targets on a full range of counterterrorism tactics and policies from 1987 to 2004. Results show that repressive actions are either unrelated to terror or related to subsequent increases in terror, and conciliatory actions are generally related to decreases in terror, depending on the tactical period. Findings also reveal the importance of understanding the role of terrorists' constituencies for reducing violence."
0,"We analyzed data from 50 states and the District of Columbia from 1960 to 2005 to study how the unemployment rate and the divorce rate are related. Unemployment is positively related to divorce in a bivariate analysis, but the association is not significant when state and year fixed effects are included in the statistical model. When the sample is divided into time periods, unemployment is negatively and significantly associated with divorce after 1980. These findings provide the strongest support for a ""cost of divorce"" perspective and suggest that a high rate of unemployment decreases the rate of divorce, net of unobserved time-invariant state characteristics and period (year) trends.

Drawing on structural and organizational theories of the workplace, the authors demonstrate how organizational conditions affect workers' and regulatory agents' understandings of unlawful discrimination. Using a national sample of work establishments, matched to discrimination-charge data obtained from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the authors examine how characteristics of the workplace and institutional environment affect variation in the incidence of workers' charges of sex and race discrimination and in the subset of discrimination claims that are verified by EEOC investigators. The findings indicate that workplace conditions, including size, composition, and minority management, affect workers' charges as well as verified claims; the latter are also affected by institutional factors, such as affirmative action requirements, subsidiary status, and industrial sector. These results suggest that internal workplace conditions affect both workers' and regulatory agents' interpretations of potentially discriminatory experiences, while institutional conditions matter only for regulatory agents' interpretations of those events."
0,"Conceptions of adulthood have changed dramatically in recent decades. Despite such changes, however, the notion that young people will eventually ""settle down"" and desist from delinquent behaviors is remarkably persistent. This article unites criminology with classic work on age norms and role behavior to contend that people who persist in delinquency will be less likely to make timely adult transitions. The empirical analysis supports this proposition, with both arrest and self-reported crime blocking the passage to adult status. The authors conclude that desisting from delinquency is an important part of the package of role behaviors that define adulthood."
0,"In this project I explore how processes of social marking can help explain the creation of historical representations. Researchers often discuss the work that goes into such a creation as though readers already understand how representations of complex people and/or events come into existence, or as though it is a naturally occurring process. By looking at the ongoing dispute over indigenous rights and agrarian land reform between the Mexican government and the Zapatista movement I examine the role of social marking in the creation of both groups’ representations of the revolutionary icon Emiliano Zapata – a process sometimes referred to as memory entrepreneurship. Since both groups use the memory of Zapata to back their claims regarding the land dispute, I also examine how the Mexican government and the Zapatistas’ different knowledge bases, traditional and organic respectively, affect which aspects of Zapata’s memory they highlight or deemphasize. I will begin with a brief history of the Zapatista movement."
0,"We advance the term appropriate labor to encompass the idea that the abstract ideal of the worker is not necessarily tied to the image of a man or men's bodies or to a bureaucratic organizational structure.  Rather, the concept of appropriate labor conveys the notion of a negotiated ideal. Who is appropriate? When are they appropriate? Where are they appropriate? And for how long will they remain appropriate? The designation of particular workers as appropriate labor is not fixed but is subject to change with fluctuations in the available labor pool, taking both race and gender into account.  Using domestic service, as an example of an occupation based in an informal, female-centered organizational structure – the household – we will illustrate how the designation of particular workers as appropriate labor is collectively defined, fluid over time, and requires institutional work."
0,"This study investigates the reasons why eligible households in Beloit, Wisconsin chose not to participate in the Food Stamps Program. Through Beloit Colleges Duffy Community Partnership Program I became an intern for Caritas, a local food pantry, where I conducted 18 interviews with people who met the criteria for Food Stamps, but were not enrolled in the program. Throughout my internship, I encountered many clients who were eligible for the program yet chose not to participate; I wanted to find out why. During these participant interviews six themes emerged. Reasons cited include: the lack of accessibility to the Food Stamp Program, the stigma associated with the program, bureaucratic issues, performing a cost-benefit analysis, the lack of information about the program, and the feeling of not deserving the help. My results show that the current rate of food stamps participation in Beloit, Wisconsin is greatly restricted by these six factors and participation rates are unlikely to increase unless policymakers can address these issues."
0,"This article extends theories of social movement diffusion to encompass other kinds of cultural modeling. Using a comparison of two cases of food protest in the United Stales the health food movement of William Sylvester Graham (1830s) and the early organic movement (1960s-1970s)-I emphasize similarities in underlying grievances and in the general advocacy of natural food alternatives. The two movements differed dramatically, however, in framing and tactics. I focus on contrasts in the religious significance they assigned to diet, in their democratic commitments, in the relationship they constructed between personal transformation and social change, and in their use of state-centered strategies. These frames and tactics transposed to food reform more general scripts associated with cultural institutions and movements of the time, particularly evangelical churches and temperance (Grahamites), and environmentalism, the New Left, and the wider counterculture (organic advocates)."
0,"Recent public health research has consistently reported that self-identified multiracial adolescents tend to display more problem behaviors and psychological difficulties than monoracial adolescents. Relying on insights from qualitative analyses using small or clinical samples to interpret these empirical patterns, these studies implicitly assume a pejorative stance toward adolescents' multiracial self-identification. Building on the social psychological arguments underlying Park's and Stonequist's seminal discussions of the ""marginal man,"" we derive hypotheses indicating that self-identified multiracial adolescents may show more psychological difficulties, but are also likely to have more active social interaction and participation than monoracial groups. We also incorporate later elaborations of the marginal man theory to develop alternative hypotheses regarding multiracial youth's school and behavioral outcomes. Based on a nationally representative sample of racially self-identified youth, the results suggest that patterns of multiracial-monoracial differences are generally consistent with the hypotheses derived closely from the marginal man theory or its subsequent elaborations. We examine the heterogeneities within these general patterns across different multiracial categories and discuss the implications of these findings."
0,"Human services occupations are prone to high rates of burnout and turnover. These outcomes have adverse implications for service providers and the clients in their care. Several studies have assessed the structural causes and consequences of burnout and turnover, but little attention has been paid to the potentially protective role of coworker support. We estimate a structural equation model including job characteristics, coworker support, and workplace justice to predict turnover intention, both directly and indirectly through emotional exhaustion. More than 1,800 substance abuse treatment counselors provided survey data for these analyses. Net of demographic and workload measures, low autonomy, and a lack of distributive justice significantly predicted emotional exhaustion, while coworker support was inversely associated with exhaustion. In turn, exhaustion was a significant predictor of intent to quit. Coworker support exhibited direct inverse effects on intent to quit, while counselors reporting low autonomy and lack of workplace justice were more likely to be contemplating quitting. These findings extend previous research by identifying specific and beneficial effects of coworker support on counselors' job-related affect and well-being."
0,"In the following study, I explore how school level characteristics such as student-teacher ratios and the racial and socioeconomic composition in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools impact eighth grade student achievement. Although individual characteristics of children are often predictors of academic success, it is impossible for U.S. education policy to control these characteristics. It is, however, possible for public policy to control the characteristics of the schools children attend. I employ Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to analyze data on eighth grade students and schools in the Charlotte Mecklenburg school system. The strategy allows me to control for as well as explore the effects of individual activities, prior test scores, and family backgrounds of students while simultaneously observing the effects of the racial and socioeconomic composition and student-teacher ratios of the school on students end of grade test scores. I find that both the  racial and socioeconomic composition of schools are important predictors of both math and reading achievement for Charlotte-Mecklenburg eighth grade students."
0,"We use a model of continuous attachments in networks to generate propositions concerning inequalities in network structures, and test the propositions on data from organizational settings. Our network model, inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality, reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements in the network members' choices. "
0,"Women's employment and childrearing are competing activities, which exert much pressure on their time and energy. Many studies have found that women in paid employment, especially in a demanding career, limit their fertility and have few children or none. This negative correlation was explained mainly in terms of opportunity costs and the incompatibility of women's employment and childrearing. This study focuses on the interplay between women's employment and fertility decisions in Israel, a socially diverse country, characterized by high levels of both fertility and female employment. We argue that in an environment which supports and encourages high fertility women's employment activity is less consequential for family planning. The study analyzes simultaneously the decision to have a third child and the decision to work. The findings show that fertility affects negatively women's work activity, but women's employment has no effect on their decision to have an additional child. Also, cultural variables affect the fertility decision but not economic considerations, while the opposite holds for the work decision. "
0,"Although the suicide rate among US. Youth between the ages of 10 to 24 dramatically increased during the past 50 years, little research has examined this outcome within larger social contexts of the adolescent environment. Relying on Durkheim's theory of social integration, we examine the effect of individual- and structural-level social integration on adolescents' suicidality. Using a sample of 6,369 respondents within 314 neighborhoods, we examine the assumptions that high levels of religious, familial, neighborhood, and school integration are associated with fewer suicide attempts among youths. We find support for the traditional Durkheimian assumptions; specifically, the proportion of religiously conservative residents in a neighborhood reduces youths' risk of attempting suicide, as do individual-level controls of school and parental attachment. Moreover; we find evidence for a cross-level interaction between depression and neighborhood level of religiosity. Depression increases youths' risk of attempting suicide, but in places where religion is very important, this positive effect of depression is diminished."
0,"Recent inequality scholarship fixates on trends in the amount of inequality and largely ignores trends in the form of inequality. The authors describe three ideal-typical inequality regimes (big-class, microclass, and gradational) and identify the mechanisms driving a shift toward or away from each of them. Using GSS and CPS data on 39 measures of life chances, attitudes, and behaviors, the authors find that big-class inequality is in decline whereas microclass inequality has remained stable. Moreover, big classes are simplifying into largely economic aggregates, whereas microclasses remain more complicated moral configurations that cannot be understood in terms of economic standing."
0,"In this paper I analyzes the share of U.S. income going to U.S. the top 1% and 0.1% of income-receiving  households during the 1949-2001.  I are stress theory and hypotheses concerning Presidential partisanship, Republican Congressional power, union density, and  the financialization of the U.S. economy, alongside controls for real per capita GDP and business cycle indicators. Because of the extensive presence of non-stationary variables, I use Error Correction models.  Results from these  indicate strong positive impacts of union decline and financialization on the income share of the top 1 and 0.1%; and they  belie claims for the relevance of Presidential and  Congressional.  I briefly discuss preliminary evidence for a common root of union decline and financialization in the de-industrialization of the U.S. economy over the last few decades"
0,"Based on an analysis of 120 intensive interviews focusing on 40 different friendships crossing the lines of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, and ability, it was apparent that the assessment of the overall impact of the social boundaries by respondents all fell within one of eight types of impact:  no impact, providing a source of bonding, being an eye-opening experience, causing some initial hesitation, encouraging them to be mindful of the difference, eliciting a sense of respect, being a source of some discomfort, and making the friends less understanding of each other.  Some types of impact were more common than others.  In addition, there were variations in the distribution of social boundaries within each type of overall impact as well as corresponding variations in the distribution of types of overall impact within each social boundary.  Within a single friendship, each friend could have a very different view of the impact of the social boundary on the friendship, although there was no consistent or recognizable pattern in these variations."
0,"Quantitative research on the world-system is led by two traditions.  One is the political economy of the world system perspective and the other the world society/world polity tradition.  These two approaches are predicated upon different theoretical assumptions.  Further, both perspectives suggest a causal priority of one over the other, enacting, in some very general way a replay of the classic Marx/Weber debate.  What is common to both views is the proposition of the existence of a global level of causal dynamics and processes that is purely autonomous from lower levels entities such as individuals and nation-states.  In the bulk of their research so far, however, analysts from both of these camps tend to overlook causal dynamics that occur at a purely global level of analysis in favor of focusing on the effect of global processes on national outcomes.  In this respect both perspectives betray their initial insight that the global constitutes an autonomous reality beyond the individual and the nation-state. In this paper, we propose that a way to extend and cash in the internal logic of both arguments is to move theoretical claims and empirical investigation beyond this limitation by focusing on the interactions between distinct global rhythms and processes, what we referred as the transition from traditional sociological to globological analysis.   We show the analytic utility of this approach by adapting methods initially developed to the study of macro-economic processes to the study of causal dynamics occurring at the supranational level, pitting the primary process isolated by the PEWS approach (economic interaction across nation states) and the World Polity approach (the expansion of a network of non-governmental organizations in global civil society) using data covering a period of 185 years from the early 19th century to the late twentieth century.  The results show that throughout that period, global civil society expansion increases whenever economic interaction across nation-state boundaries increaseswhat has been referred to in the PEWS literature as structural globalizationbut that economic globalization is largely causally independent from the expansion and structuration of world civil society."
0,"This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature on organizations and inequality by investigating the central role of merit-based reward systems in shaping gender and racial disparities in wages and promotions. The author develops and tests a set of propositions isolating processes of performance-reward bias, whereby women and minorities receive less compensation than white men with equal scores on performance evaluations. Using personnel data from a large service organization, the author empirically establishes the existence of this bias and shows that gender, race, and nationality differences continue to affect salary growth after performance ratings are taken into account, ceteris paribus. This finding demonstrates a critical challenge faced by the many contemporary employers who adopt merit-based practices and policies. Although these policies are often adopted in the hope of motivating employees and ensuring meritocracy, policies with limited transparency and accountability can actually increase ascriptive bias and reduce equity in the workplace."
0,"Utilizing data from thirty-one in-depth interviews collected over a four-month period, this paper examines marriage choices made by transnational migrants who left Syria as adults and later returned to the homeland to enter the labor market. The literature on international marriage traditionally focuses on migrant settlers, conceiving marriage as an event that occurs following international migration from peripheral to core countries. Moreover, scholars of international marriages focus almost exclusively on marriage choices among low-skilled migrants. This paper broadens the transnational marriage literature by focusing on the previously unexplored issue of marriage choices among high-skilled return migrants whose initial intention to settle was flexibly determined. I show how the nexus of marriage and migration is linked to larger questions about national identity, cultural maintenance, and gender ideologies across time. I argue that for Syrian men, academic credentialing in the West vastly increases their marriage options, both within Syria and on the international marriage market. For Syrian women, on the other hand, earning an advanced degree in the West dramatically decreases marriage choices, leaving women with a wealth of economic potential which they are often unwilling to abandon in order to fulfill the duties of a “traditional” wife. By focusing on the globalization of this gendered “marriage gradient,” this paper expands our understanding of marital selection, transnationalism, and global migration."
0,"Sociologists widely acknowledge that uncertainty matters for decision making, but they rarely measure it directly. In this article, we demonstrate the importance of theorizing about, measuring, and analyzing uncertainty as experienced by individuals. We adapt a novel probabilistic solicitation technique to measure personal uncertainty about HIV status in a high HIV prevalence area of southern Malawi. Using data from 2,000 young adults (ages 15 to 25 years), we demonstrate that uncertainty about HIV status is widespread and that it expands as young adults assess their proximate and distant futures. In conceptualizing HIV status as something more than sero-status itself, we gain insight into how what individuals know they don't know influences their lives. Young people who are uncertain about their HIV status express desires to accelerate their childbearing relative to their counterparts who are certain they are uninfected. Our approach and findings show that personal uncertainty is a measurable and meaningful phenomenon that can illuminate much about individuals' aspirations and behaviors."
0,"Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination in employment on the basis of color is prohibited, and color is a protected basis independent from race. Using data from the spouses of the main respondents to the New Immigrant Survey 2003, this paper shows that immigrants with the lightest skin color earn on average 16-23% more than comparable immigrants with the darkest skin color. These estimates control for years of legal permanent residence in the US, education, English language proficiency, occupation in source country, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, race, country of birth, as well as for extensive current labor market characteristics that may be themselves influenced by discrimination. Furthermore, the skin color penalty does not diminish over time. These results are consistent with persistent skin color discrimination affecting legal immigrants to the United States. "

The  world  has  become  socially  smaller  in the  sense  that there is  no  clear  demarcation  line  to  separate  domestic  concerns from  international  issues.

0,"Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U. S. studies have employed ""best single race"" questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a ""best single race"" survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a ""best single race"" (BSR) question captures someone's sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents' choice of ""white"" as their BSR."
0,"This paper uses recent data on tenth graders' performance, and school and family lives to provide a current assessment of generational disparities in math and reading scores, and to evaluate the roles played by a broad range of predictors in creating the observed relative performance of immigrant, second- and third-generation students. In the presence of a wide range of predictors, we find that preschool-aged immigrants outperform the third-plus generation in reading, while the third-plus generation scored higher than school-aged immigrants in reading and outperformed the second generation in both math and reading. We also find that all children of immigrants benefit from very high parental expectations, and that recently arrived immigrants have strong feelings of school attachment which they manifest in pro-school behaviors. In contrast, third-plus generation students socialize more heavily and are relatively indifferent toward school, but have access to more and stronger forms of between-family social capital. These generational differences in attitudes and social capital, and their subsequent effects on generational disparities in academic performance, lend considerable support to the immigrant optimism hypothesis.

0,"It has been argued that the effects of the desegregation of public schools from the late 1960s onward were limited and short-lived, in part because of white flight from desegregating districts and in part because legal decisions in the 1990s released many districts from court orders. Data presented here for 1970-2000 show that small increases in segregation between districts were outweighed by larger declines within districts. Progress was interrupted but not reversed after 1990. Desegregation was not limited to districts and metropolitan regions where enforcement actions required it, and factors such as private schooling, district size, and inclusion of both city and suburban areas within district boundaries had stronger effects than individual court mandates."

0,"Theories of fertility change have long attributed family and friends with persistent influences on the many behaviors affecting individual fertility.  However, the difficulty of empirically estimating such social influences has complicated identifying the pathways linking families and friends to individual fertility outcomes.  This paper examines the importance of social interactions in fertility outcomes by estimating the effects of family structure and family members fertility on individual fertility outcomes.  Genealogical data from eight countries in Europe are used to estimate family effects on individual age at first birth and cumulative fertility.  In the below replacement fertility regime of modern Europe, there is little evidence of the inter-generational correlations in fertility behaviors which have historically characterized fertility change.  In contrast to parents, siblings maintain relatively important effects for individual fertility.  Moreover, womens fertility is more subject to the influences of their sisters than their brothers.  These findings illustrate the relative importance among one set of social interactions influencing individual fertility.  They also outline pathways of influence among family members that present a potentially important set of forces in Europes sustained below replacement fertility."
0,"This paper reports results of an experiment on the relationship between whites' implicit racial bias and prosocial behavior toward blacks. We hypothesized that implicit anti-black bias would lead to less prosocial behavior (generosity with limited monetary resources). Consistent with our hypothesis, the results revealed that implicit anti-black bias, measured by the Implicit Association Test, had a negative effect on generosity toward blacks. This finding extends prior work by showing that implicit racial bias affects non-hypothetical decisions about how to allocate limited monetary resources. We conclude with a discussion of implications and suggestions for future work. "
0,"Unmarried black women now work at lower rates than married black women, a reversal of long-standing trends in female employment patterns that has not occurred among white women.  Using the NLSY and survival techniques, we examine the effect of marital status on womens entry into and exits out of employment.   We find that married black women are more likely to enter employment than unmarried black women; however, the opposite is true for white women.  Both black and white married women are less likely to exit employment than their unmarried counterparts.  We conclude that marital status and employment levels have both become by-products of the level of human capital and the labor market characteristics of black women."
0,"With the proliferation of alternative relationship forms such as non-marital cohabitation, it might be expected that traditional union formation scripts in which the man is the initiator and the female shows receptiveness to his advances are passé.  Using in-depth interviews with 30 working class cohabiting couples, we find that most couples still comply with traditional dating scripts throughout various phases of their relationships including the first date, moving in together, and discussing marriage.  While women were more likely than main to raise the idea of living together, couples were far more likely to move into the mans residence than the womens.  Furthermore, they often relied on indirect methods to advance the relationship, allowing them to follow normative gendered expectations.  Nowhere are gender norms more prevalent than in expectations regarding proposals.  The vast majority of those expecting they will marry their partner believe that the man should propose, while the women must wait to be asked; even those not desiring this arrangement indicate that it is the pattern they themselves will follow.  Only four couples assert that they intend for cohabitation to be an alternative to the marriage.  Despite living in alternative unions, most cohabitors are not challenging normative gender expectations regarding relationship progression."
0,"My research is a study of how coalitions of social movement organizations (SMOs) solve conflict; it addresses the dearth in the literature of social movement research. My study will illuminate how SMOs work out problems of collaboration, thereby facilitating more effective organizations. Coalitions can take many forms, but I define them as organizations composed of SMOs, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community organizations, and activists involved in collaborative work. Given this diversity, for a coalition to be successful it must find methods for resolving the conflicts that can emerge from participating in collective activities. I focus on conflict resolution methods in coalitions for increasing the likelihood of reaching collective goals. The agendas of SMOs can include, increasing coalition membership, incorporating diverse organizations, and mobilizing funding and volunteers to enhance their ability to meet constituent needs."
0,"Modernization theory argues that, as societies industrialize and further develop, the influence of social background and other ascribed characteristics on educational and socioeconomic Outcomes declines, while achievement in the education system becomes more important. The purpose of this research is to investigate propositions derived from modernization theory as they apply to Australian society during the second half of the 2 0,h century. Specifically, these are (1. declines in the influence of socioeconomic background on education, occupation and earnings; (2. increases in the occupational and economic returns to education; and (3. decreases in gender inequalities in all three outcomes. These propositions are examined using data from nationally representative surveys conducted from 1965 through 2005. In accordance with modernization theory, it was found that the effects of socioeconomic background on education, occupational attainment and earnings have declined. Gender inequalities in education have been reversed, and the gender gap in earnings has declined. The effect of education on occupational attainment has increased more strongly among men than women. Contrary to expectations from one interpretation of modernization theory, the returns in earnings from education have not increased."
0,"Building on Preston and Campbell's two-sex model of intergenerational transmission, this article provides a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of the racial distribution in black-white-mulatto systems. The author shows that ""bounded"" patterns of racial classification and switching imply long-run racial homogeneity in the absence of differential reproduction. Beyond the theoretical analysis, the author attempts to account for the dramatic growth of the white population share in Puerto Rico in the early 20th century. Because the effects of racial classification and differential reproduction were roughly offsetting, the observed growth of the white share can be attributed almost entirely to racial switching."
0,"Many urban Mapuche activists in Chile argue that in order to gain collective rights, they must regain their ancestral territory. In making this argument, however, these urban activists ignore the complications that arise from the fact that approximately 60 percent of the Mapuche population is urban. Furthermore, they fail to acknowledge the possibility that urban Mapuche people as a whole will not gain any direct benefits from regaining land as many of the urban dwellers do not want to return to rural communities. Why, then, do urban Mapuche organizations believe that their collective rights rest on gaining land rights? Using theories of both multicultural citizenship and urban indigenous identity, I argue that these activists and organizations are reacting to two distinct processes. First, they are reacting to discriminatory state policies towards Mapuche land rights; despite the fact that Chile has signed international legislation recognizing indigenous peoples rights, the state engages in a dual policy that prioritizes neoliberal economic policies and leaves little room for dialogue about indigenous claims for collective rights. Second, many urban Mapuche activists fear that the state is forcing them to choose an urban identity over and at the expense of a Mapuche one, and thus these indigenous activists cling to the characteristic which they feel defines them as part of the Mapuche people  land."
0,"Isomorphism is frequently used as an outcome measure in organizational research, particularly as evidence of institutional forces. But what does measuring isomorphism actually measure? And, how do you identify isomorphism when it appears? In the classic article by DiMaggio and Powell (1983) isomorphism is defined as the tendency for the structures of organizations to become similar to each other. Over the years there have been many operationalizations of isomorphism, most often as the presence of one or a few criteria that the researcher says are measures of isomorphism. I argue that these operationalizations have lost the original relational and multidimensional aspects of the concept and therefore fail to exploit its primary strength. This paper presents an alternative method for operationalizing isomorphism that treats it as a relational concept that can encompass heterogeneity. I demonstrate this alternative method by measuring isomorphism in organizational texts and documents, an excellent source for studying phenomena such as isomorphism that are of wide interest to organizational researchers. I also summarize the different uses of isomorphism in organizational research and how its conflation with diffusion and its use as both a mechanism or process and as an outcome has led to some theoretical confusion."
0,"Though overlooked by students of ethnic and racial studies, animal practices can be a key organizing principle of everyday life and identity.  Based on interviews and three weeks of participant observation in Berlin, Germany, this study examines how a group of Turkish men experience and assign significance to the activity of caring for domestic pigeons.  The men experience their connection to these animals as in the blood and naturally given (primordial), and through their relationships with pigeons they anchor their identity in the morally pure realm of nature.  Even while this paper demonstrates the role of interactional processes (circumstances) in shaping how animal practices are framed, it shows that the actors experience of their attachments to animals as primordial is a distinct pattern of orientation.  Linking this finding to phenomenological investigations of religious experience, the instrumentalist assumptions of many circumstantialist theorists are critiqued.  This study builds on primordialist approaches to ethnicity and nation that follow the cognitive turn, and widens the scope of inquiry to include animals and nature as objects of primordial attachment."
0,"Sociology with a Southern face characterizes Southern sociologists and Southern social issues. This article asks why we are sociologists and what we are doing about it in the South. I posit that many Southern sociologists share common biographical experiences that provide insights for understanding and solving Southern problems. Longstanding conditions of the Black Belt are used as an example with special focus on Southern demographics and persistent impoverishment. Given the magnitude of the southern issues involved, I believe there are good reasons for doing sociology about the South. I conclude with a call for sociologists with Southern faces - wherever they live - to pay greater attention to solutions as well as using our sociological expertise to diagnose social problems we see through the Southern face of sociology."
0,"Gendered portrayals of characters in television and film is a well-researched topic, but comparatively little information exists concerning the depictions of male and female characters in movie posters.  This study analyzes movie posters for the 10 top-grossing films of 2007, 2008, and 2009 (n=30) using qualitative and quantitative methods to determine if patterns known to be present in film and television are mirrored in the movie posters.  When compared to their female counterparts, male characters exhibit an extremely limited range of emotion and are frequently posed in such a way as to highlight their individuality and agency.  All of the posters carefully maintain a heteronormative construction of gender.  Female characters are present in the posters at a substantially lower rate than they appear in television or film.  They are allowed a greater degree of flexibility when it comes to emotional expression and display less power and assertiveness than male characters.  Both groups are sexualized at an approximately equal rate."
0,"In this paper, I examine the boundaries of normative sexuality and show how gender plays an important role in the construction of “good” versus “bad” sex. To do so, I focus on Christian sexuality websites, which are created by and for evangelicals to discuss how to achieve God’s intent for married, heterosexual couples: to have active and mutually-satisfying sex lives. Drawing on data from interviews with website users and analysis of online content, I examine the ways in which some evangelicals justify non-normative sex within the confines on heterosexuality and gender normalcy. Website users rely on what I refer to as the “holy triangle” of gender normalcy—the relationship between the self, spouse, and God—in order to justify “bad” sex as “good.” By situating gender within a relational and spiritual (and therefore subjective) context, these evangelicals are able to simultaneously normalize the kinds of behaviors that they participate in and condemn others who may participate in similar acts but fail to meet the requirements of the holy triangle."

Using hierarchical logistic modeling, we find that the sex difference in feelings of depression is wider in high gender equity societies because children increase depression for women in high gender equity societies, while they reduce depression for women without paid employment in low gender equity societies.

Using four-wave panel data from the Americans’ Changing Lives Survey (N = 1182), I predict alcohol and cigarette use by examining the effects of (1) volunteering, (2) socio-demographic factors as moderators, (3) type of volunteer organization, and (4) contextual aspects of volunteer organizations.  Findings indicate volunteer activity does not reduce health risk behavior generally, but volunteering for a religious organization decreases the incidence rate of alcohol and tobacco use.  Supplemental analysis suggests that the time constraints and contextual appropriateness associated with participation in a religious community might contribute to this incident rate reduction."
0,"We question the common assumption that education promotes tolerance and thereby limits ethnic violence and propose instead that education might actually heighten the risk of ethnic violence in four ways:  by strengthening oppositional identities, exacerbating ethnic-based stratification, expanding mobilizational capacity, and increasing anomie.  We test these competing theories through cross-national statistical methods.  While controlling for several factors and using three different measures of average societal education, education is positively and significantly related to communal conflict, suggesting that assumptions about the effects of education on tolerance and violence need to be reconsidered."
0,"Despite a great deal of public discourse concerning the effect of the September 11th attacks on Americans' religious and spiritual lives, social scientists know very little about the nature, size, and duration of this effect. Using panel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study analyzes the influence of 9/11 on the religious and spiritual lives of American young adults. The results suggest that the 9/11 attacks exerted only modest and short-lived effects on various aspects of young adults' religiosity and spirituality, and these effects were variable across different groups. These findings suggest that no remarkable religious revival occurred among young adults after September 11th, and researchers interested in analyzing religious development across the life course or religious change over time need not worry about sea changes in religiosity and spirituality brought on by 9/11."
0,"This paper undertakes to reexamine world-systems analysis and historical social science in light of the Braudelian notion of the ""very long term.""  It is well known that from the very outset, world-systems analysis was constructed by Wallerstein as a critique of the disciplinary social sciences from the perspective of the ""longue duree"", which was recommended as a middle way between the atemporal metaphysics of sociology and the qualitatively empty chronology of historiography (as well as between what Wallerstein saw as their incarnations in the recent work of other world-systemists).  Alternatively, the timeless equilibrium or the endless sequence of events were seen as variants of the ""very long term"" perspective, which was seen to distort sociohistorical reality, and about which Braudel was said to be skeptical.  Yet, however skeptical Braudel may have been about a social science based exclusively on the very long term perspective, he nevertheless provided as detailed a description of it as of his three other temporalities, all of which play an important role in configuring Wallerstein's units of analysis - his world-systems.  Moreover, Braudel utilized the very long term as one of the temporalities in his own work.  Having established this, our task will be to try to reincorporate this temporality into the world-systems perspective.  The purpose of doing so is twofold.  First, it facilitates a workable synthesis between the increasingly divergent positions taken by world-systemists within the last decade.  Second, in so doing, it endeavors to survive the predicted demise of the the merely critical world-systems analysis by remaining true to Wallerstein's principles and by laying the groundwork for a theoretical and constructive (world)-historical social science."
0,"How do transnational employers interpret the rules of global capitalism, and how do they design and implement labor practices and policies consistent with these interpretations? This analysis identifies the ways in which managers employ gendered assumptions in constructing and implementing labor practices among highly skilled professional workers in the post–socialist Hungarian finance sector. Relying on thirty-three in-depth semi-structured interviews with employers in the Hungarian finance sector as well as interviews with headhunting firms, labor and employment lawyers and archival analysis of all cases brought before Hungary’s Equal Treatment Authority between 2004 and 2008, we identify several of the specific strategies these global employers use to shed, demote and marginalize employed white collar mothers considered inefficient and thus too expensive for the company. Our findings suggest that employers construct the competitive imperatives of market capitalism in such a way that enhances or reinforces cultural stereotypes related to motherhood and results in the design of recruiting, hiring and promotion practices that discriminate against women with children."
0,"Strategic and tactical planning for military intervention needs revision as the causes, methods, and means of conflict have evolved. Counter-insurgent engagement is one such intervention that governments, militaries, and non-governmental organizations seek to better understand. Modeling insurgencies is an acceptable means to gain insight into the various characteristics of asymmetric warfare to proffer prescriptive resolutions for mitigating their effects. Colombia's insurgency poses the challenge of assessing population behavior in a non-traditional revolutionary climate. Factors prevalent in traditional insurgency are not applicable in Colombia, specifically between the years 1993 and 2001 with the democratization of the drug cartels. The catastrophic events of September 11th reverberated in Colombia resulting in a new policy and strategy to the waging the counter-insurgency there. This research introduces a structured methodology to modeling the Colombian counter-insurgency incorporating qualitative assessment, mathematical representation, and a System Dynamics approach to represent the effects of the policy change.

0,"This paper examines gender differences in the participation of university life science faculty in the opportunities afforded by the emergence of commercial science. Our particular focus is on the scientific advisory boards (SABs) of biotechnology firms. In part based on interviews of faculty members, we develop hypotheses regarding how scientists career achievementstheir productivity, co-authorship networks, institutional affiliation and patenting activityhave different effects on the likelihood that male and female faculty will become SAB members. We then statistically examine this framework in a case cohort dataset containing the career histories of 6,000 life scientists. We find that participation in for-profit ventures appears to be a new arena in which gender differences in attainment are extensive: women life scientists are far less likely to receive paid advisory roles at for-profit biotechnology companies. Moreover, the gap in participation rates persists after conditioning on numerous measures of human and social capital. We also find that this gender difference is contoured by a number of factors; notably university prestige, co-authorship networks and the level of institutional support for commercial science. Collectively, the qualitative and quantitative findings of this paper establish a large gender gap in the participation of university faculty members in commercial science. They suggest that female faculty are constrained largely by lack of opportunity and, surprisingly, that the gender gap is largest in high prestige institutions."

In this paper we ask (1) who are these faculty? (2) What factors led them to become involved? (3) What are the ways in which they seek to bring about change on their campus, and (4) what are the consequences both for the institution and the individual faculty member of their ongoing involvement."
0,"Men who have sex with men use the Internet to find partners for offline sexual encounters, but there is little research about mens own perspectives on this practice.  The Men, Internet and Sex with Men Study was a qualitative inquiry into mens use of the Internet for same-sex sexual purposes. This paper specifically addresses mens presentation of self in the online sexual search, how men interpret the selves presented by potential partners, and the insight such inquiry offers about sexual risk behaviour.  Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with men (gay, bisexual and heterosexual) in Toronto, Ontario who use the Internet for same-sex sexual purposes.  Dramaturgical concepts were used to frame mens processes for finding sexual partners online.  Men used techniques of e-presentation of self to attract sexual partners: impression management for the desired partner; reinvented and/or multiple selves; and impression management for sexual safety.  Men used other tactics for interpreting selves presented by potential sexual partners: constructing compatibility, physical safety and sexual safety.  The dramaturgical focus reveals positive and negative implications for sexual behaviour among men who seek sex online, related to unique attributes of the Internet.  Such interactionist inquiry helps illuminate crossroads between technology and public health."
0,"This paper describes how peer-to-peer sexual harassment rapidly was transformed from an unremarkable reality of secondary school life into a serious social and legal problem.  First, it shows how organizations and professionals served as an entry-point for social change and legal mobilization.  I argue that schools were quick to address peer sexual harassment because activists framed it as a moral and pedagogical issue that resonated with educators' deeply held professional values.  Second, the paper shows how law and organizations develop endogenously.  Without any legal mandate, schools created and institutionalized harassment policies.  Courts then looked to these organizational practices to determine the content and scope of Title IX.  In this way, schools literally ""enacted"" the law through their practices.  This finding goes beyond previous work on endogeneity in that school policies influenced law at the level of doctrine, not simply at the level of meaning, enforcement or application."
0,"What factors influence the severity of rape law?  This paper explores the question of why states have enacted rape statutes that differ in severity.  Drawing on theories of gender stratification, hypotheses are developed using gender income equality measures.  Threat hypotheses are also tested by examining the effects of minority presence on statute construction.  Ordinal probit models are used to test these hypotheses using data obtained from the rape statutes of all fifty states in the years 1970, 1980, and 1990.  Key findings are that (1) female economic equality is a significant factor explaining increased legal severity; (2) minority presence in the historically Confederate south is strongly associated with legal severity; (3) the presence of a Republican governor and Republican controlled legislature are associated with increased legal severity; (4) the political ideology of state citizens also posses significant explanatory power.  These results support hypotheses that the state acts in the interest of the economically powerful and racial majority.  As female economic power increases, the state will enact laws in their interest.  More importantly, this paper also finds support for the hypothesis that historical prejudice and racial fear influences states to enact more severe rape laws."
0,"Social scientists have become increasingly interested in the racial identification choices of multiracial individuals, partly as a result of the federal government's new ""check all that apply"" method of racial identification. However, the majority of work to date has narrowly defined the population of multiracial individuals as the ""biracial"" children of single-race parents. In this article, we use the open-ended ancestry questions on the 1990 and 2000 5% samples of the US Census to identify a multiracial population that is potentially broader in its understanding of multiraciality. Relative to other studies, we find stronger historical continuity in the patterns of hypodescent and hyperdescent for part-black and part-American Indian ancestry individuals respectively, while we find that multiple-race identification is the modal category for those of part-Asian ancestry. We interpret this as evidence of a new, more flexible classification regime for groups rooted in more recent immigration. Our results suggest that future work on multiracial identification must pay closer attention to the varied histories of specific multiracial ancestry groups. "
0,"Employing general strain theory, the authors examine gender differences in the dynamic strain-and-coping relations between GPA, depression, and drinking. Using longitudinal high school data from the Youth Development Study, the authors test five hypotheses. GPA negatively affects drinking (confirming Hypothesis 1), but without consistent gender differences (Hypothesis 1a). GPA also negatively affects depression (Hypothesis 2), and more strongly for girls (Hypothesis 2a). Depression's positive effect on drinking supports Hypothesis 3, but gender comparisons refute Hypothesis 3a. Conversely, drinking positively affects lagged depression (Hypothesis 4), and more strongly for girls (Hypothesis 4a). Finally, drinking's largely absent effect on GPA rejects Hypothesis 5a, whereas depression's negative effect on lagged GPA, stronger among girls, supports Hypothesis 5b and Hypothesis 5c. A deleterious chain of effects occurs across high school, but mostly for girls only, possibly implicating gendered behavioral norms and socialization. This study informs general strain theory by suggesting that alcohol may provide divergent behavioral and emotional coping functions, respectively, for boys and girls."

Drawing on theoretical perspectives and empirical data, this article focuses on ordinary Americans who have suffered during trying times. First, one popular set of political narratives is shown to fit the sociological model of ""blaming the victim."" Second, General Social Survey data from 1991 and 2004 are used to counter charges of widespread consumer opportunism and to expose the serious systemic vulnerabilities that existed for Americans before the recession."
0,"By the mid-2000s, ethnic supermarket chains primarily targeting Latino consumers made up 10% of the overall supermarket market share in Southern California. The expansion of the Latino supermarket niche in Southern California has come hand in hand with the expansion of the Latino population over the past 30 years. While chains like those examined in this paper have begun to spring up in other regions in the United States, the Los Angeles metropolitan area is the incubator for this new wave of large scale ethnic entrepreneurship. The birth and growth of these ethnic supermarket chains mirror the social, demographic, political, and economic conditions in Los Angeles over the past few decades, conditions that have provided ethnic entrepreneurs with the opportunity to build grocery empires with revenues in the hundreds of millions each year. What impact do these chains have on ethnic entrepreneurship by individuals? How do communities react to outside ethnic enterprises? How do these chains become part of the local ethnic community? This paper will explore these questions through case studies of three communities in which supermarket chains have set up shop. The first is an upper middle class northwestern Los Angeles county suburb (Santa Clarita) that has recently become increasingly Latino. The second is a traditionally working class Latino community in Anaheim, California. Finally the third is inner city and recently increasingly Latino area of South Los Angeles."
0,"The purpose of the current study is to investigate the link between online activism and organizational membership and civic activism in the local community. We took advantage of the existence of spontaneously organized community bulletin boards in two suburban communities in Israel and collected data from local residents that participate and the ones that do not participate in these lists. We compare both groups in the level of locally based membership and participation in civic activities in order to find out whether online political activism is translated in face to face participation and community based social activism. The findings show that online local involvement has a positive effect on organizational membership and participation in civic activities, beyond and over the effect of social and economic stakes in the community. The results provide a further indication that online activities matter and have an effect on every day life of local communities. The implications of the findings for the formation of community social capital and directions for future research are discussed."
0,"How do developments in global discourse influence the trajectories of the politics of race in relation to economic and citizenship status in particular nation-states?  In this paper, we consider the trajectories of claims to indigenous rights in Fiji and Tanzania.  Historical development of global constructions of indigeneity have paralleled the rise of the system of nation-states and have come to identify indigenous peoples as culturally distinct minorities whose human rights are at-risk.  Claims to indigenous rights have been deployed in Fiji and Tanzania that are contrary to these global constructions.  Indigenous Fijians have asserted claims to political dominance and favorable economic treatment, while in Tanzania attempts to redistribute economic wealth have been framed as indigenization.  Comparison between the cases shows greater direct engagement of international law in Fiji as an attempt to internationalize a domestic dispute, while in Tanzania an attempt to domesticate international developments led to limited direct engagement.  Consequently, domestic rhetoric in Fiji was both more likely to shift over time as international law developed and be challenged domestically as inapplicable.  In both countries, successful creations of national identity, in line with historical constructions of indigeneity, have rendered current claims of indigenous rights counter to global constructions."
0,"Parents whose children have been removed by state child welfare agencies are offered services to resocialize them so they will become adequate parents and can then regain custody of their children.  Using fieldwork and interview data, this paper examines how the state assesses successful rehabilitation.  Using a Foucauldian definition of normalization, this paper argues that parents are evaluated based on their ability to demonstrate reformation in narrowly prescribed ways.  Specifically, parents must comply with services, demonstrate meaningful change as a result of services, and explicitly admit culpability for the allegation that led the family into the system.  Without satisfying all three prongs of demonstrable rehabilitation, parents will fail to regain custody of their children."
0,"The literature on the development of the antigay Christian Right suggests that its increased access to political institutions has lead it to follow the expected path of moderation and deradicalization. However, I argue that this moderation has remained on the strategic level of framing and that the movement’s ideology has remained largely intact. This is because a focus on framing has a) exaggerated the voluntaristic aspect of movement strategies (thereby allowing strategic reframing to be seen as signs of moderation); and consequently, b) improperly focused the main axis of power as between opposing movements, rather than on the relationship between movements and core political institutions. Returning to this latter focus allows us to see the intimate connection the antigay Christian Right has had with the economic Right in the U.S. This relationship is seen in two ways:  the Christian Right’s introduction into politics itself as the product of the economic Right’s campaign of reframing gives it close access to a successful model of ideological camouflage; second, its function as the mobilizing wing of the economic Right increases its ability to act on its own terms. A focus on framing undermines the central determinant of a movement’s moderation (or lack): the relationship of movements to the core political institutions that sponsor or suppress them."

We focus on aspects of family structure that affect parental support and estimate shared family variance in investments as well as within-family variation using a multilevel model. Family membership accounts for about 60% of the variance in payment of college costs. Small family size, living with both biological parents (compared to one biological parent and a stepparent), higher parental education, and having older parents are associated with greater parental expenditures.

0,"Ancestor worship and bloodline continuation are the core norms of lineage in China. Beginning in the late 1970s, these cultural norms came into direct confrontation with the state birth control policy. Pitched against each other are the antinatalist laws backed by the powerful and unyielding state apparatus on the one side and the ancient pronatalist norms backed by revived lineage networks on the other. Even though the draconian state policies did succeed in dramatically reducing the overall birthrates, data analyses show that villages with strong kinship networks tend to have higher birthrates. The findings demonstrate the normative capacity of social networks to bend the iron bars of formal institutions. A general framework is developed for analyzing the roles of social networks in four ideal-typical juxtapositions of formal and informal institutions: normativism, legalism, congruence, and conflict."
0,"Attributions of responsibility (AR) are of interest to sociologists and psychologists. However, the measurement of AR has been inconsistent both within and across the disciplines. The present study tests whether AR is a multidimensional or unidimensional concept. Data for study 1 were collected from 201 undergraduate students at a large, midwestern university. Results indicate that there are four factors associated with AR, supporting the contention that AR is a multidimensional concept. Study 2 replicated the findings of the first with a sample of 441 undergraduates. Results indicate that there are four factors that respondents consider when attributing responsibility for wrongdoing."
0,"Individuals who belong to social movement organizations (SMOs) do not necessarily identify themselves with the larger social movement overall. This sharp disconnect presents challenges to highly motivated activists, who rely on widespread movement identification to achieve their most valued goals in the political arena. This study aims to map out the conditions under which the movement identification process takes place. A mixed methods approach employs both content analysis and logit modeling techniques on original data collected from 149 members of fathers' rights groups located across the United States in 2003. In terms of results, first, the content analysis methods that are used on the interview data illustrate that SMO participants most commonly cite the social movement's formulation of a strong, social change goal when they consider the movement identification decision. Second, the logit models which are employed on the quantitative data show that engagement in externally-oriented identity work activitiesor those activities that require members to interact with nonmembers of their immediate group in building their collective identityas well as personal strain and notions of political efficacy are the most significant predictors of individual-level social movement identification. These results highlight the social movement features that are most significant to both movement identifiers and nonidentifiers, and demonstrate the importance of externally-oriented identity work on the conversion of simple SMO participation to social movement identification."
0,"Racial and ethnic identity becomes most prevalent during adolescence. Understanding racial choice and change during adolescence is important to understand how youth perceive themselves, which in turn affects their relationships with others.  Using data from Waves I and III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (henceforth Add Health), a nationally representative sample of youth in 7-12th grades, we examine changes in racial identification over time among Hispanic adolescents.  Empirical analyses suggest that the initial racial identification of the respondents has significant impact on the odds of changing race by Wave III.  We also find evidence that family and context have significant effect on the change of racial identifier over time.  Overall, our findings support the notion of fluidity of race, but also find that race is only a fluid choice for some Hispanic youth."
0,"We analyze the relationship between Hispanic population growth and changes in U.S. rural income inequality from 1990 through 2000. Applying comparative approaches used for urban areas we disentangle Hispanic population growth's contribution to inequality by comparing and statistically modeling changes in the family income Gini coefficient across four rural county types: established Hispanic, rapidly growing Hispanic, rapidly growing non-Hispanic, and slow-growth or declining counties. Results support perspectives that stress growing social heterogeneity for understanding the contribution of minority population growth to inequality, including changes in human capital and industrial restructuring. We find remarkably similar inequality growth across rapidly growing Hispanic and non-Hispanic counties. This suggests that growing rural inequality stems largely from economic expansion and population growth rather than changing Hispanic composition."
0,"Despite their longstanding interest in race, American sociologists have conducted little empirical research on sociodemographic patterns or longitudinal trends in ""racial conceptualization""-that is, notions of what race is, how races differ, and the origins of race. This article outlines key empirical, methodological and theoretical considerations for a research agenda on racial conceptualization. Drawing on in-depth interviews with more than 50 college students, I describe the variety of race concepts among respondents, illustrate the importance of using multiple measures of conceptualization, and demonstrate the malleability of conceptualization, linking it to demographic context and thereby raising the question of its future evolution in the changing United States of the 21(st) century."
0,"The systematic analysis of documentation status and its effects on children of immigrants is particularly timely and important given recent debates on immigration in the media and the defeat of recent proposed legislation such as the DREAM Act, which would have expanded opportunities for higher education and pathways to citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants.  Using in-depth interviews with 50 Brazilian children of immigrants in young adulthood, I deconstruct the conventional black/white categorization of documented/undocumented, examining the In-Between status that many immigrant children occupy, often for long periods of their lives.  In so doing, I argue that the state continues to structure opportunities through the creation of categories of membership, statuses which are uncertain and confusing for the immigrant youth.  I examine the effects of the states power on the ground: how the uncertain statuses that result from the implementation of United States laws affect immigrant childrens daily lives, social worlds, and outlooks for the future.  The findings have implications for discussions of the state, citizenship/belonging, immigrant incorporation, and transitions to adulthood."
0,"Research on philanthropy has not examined whether charitable giving to religious causes can impinge on giving to secular causes. In this paper we focus specifically on the role of organized religion in enabling or suppressing individual-level charitable giving to nonreligious causes, with a special emphasis on charities that provide basic necessities to individuals in need.  We outline several key sociological insights related to giving behavior that lead to conflicting expectations about the role that religious giving and participation might play in decisions to increase or decrease giving to secular causes.  Using panel data measuring giving and spanning a four year period, we develop a critical test of these competing hypotheses.  Our findings reveal that the relationship between religious and secular giving is generally not of a zero-sum nature: families that increase their religious giving tend to increase their secular giving as well, except in particular religious traditions.  We suggest several social-psychological, cultural, and institutional mechanisms for why this might be the case.  Our study challenges some prevailing assumptions about how philanthropy works and proposes important future avenues of exploration."
0,"Using a national probability sample of adolescents (12-17), this study applies general strain theory to how violent victimization, vicarious violent victimization, and dual violent victimization affect juvenile violent/property crime and drug use. In addition, the mediating effect and moderating effect of depression, low social control, and delinquent peer association on the victimization-delinquency relationship is also examined. Based on SEM analyses and contingency tables, the results indicate that all three types of violent victimization have significant and positive direct effects on violent/property crime and drug use. In addition, the expected mediating effects and moderating effects are also found. Limitations and future directions are discussed."
0,"With minimal foreign capital infusions (the limited Soviet financial aid), Chinese mercantilist state had to appropriate the fruit of the land reform: the rural surplus that was formally appropriated by the landlords was extracted through collectivization. The rural surplus was transferred to industry through supplying urban workers in state enterprises with cheap food in order to suppress industrial wage. This allowed Chinese state to sustain a more rapid pace of self-reliance accumulation and industrialization. Chinese mercantilist states dual exploitation of peasants and urban workers strengthened the rural-urban dichotomy."
0,"Comparisons of wellbeing between the United States and Western Europe generally show that most Americans have higher standards of living than do Western Europeans at comparable locations in their national income distributions. These comparisons of wellbeing typically privilege disposable income and cash transfers while ignoring other aspects Of we are state and labor market structure that potentially affect the distribution of wellbeing in a society. We argue that non-work time is such a factor. In this empirical exercise involving the United States and the Netherlands, we show that reasonable estimates of the contribution to wellbeing from non-market activities such as the raising of children or longer vacations can overturn claims in the literature that the United States offers greater wellbeing to more of its citizens than do western European countries."
0,"We use a lifecourse framework to examine how the ""new risk economy"" has left middle-age professionals, managers and executives more vulnerable to job loss and unemployment despite high levels of human capital. Using in-depth qualitative data from 77 recently-unemployed white-collar workers, we examine perceptions of macro-economic forces and their implications for respondents' career-recovery plans and expectations for their own and their children's future career pathways. We find that most respondents attributed their job loss to factors associated with globalization and used coping strategies that involved adapting a 'free-agent"" mentality in the face of declining employer loyalty and deprofessionalization to manage perceptions of age bias. Respondents also make mastering the ""new risk economy"" a developmental goal for themselves and their children."

0,"Research into the influence of the neighborhood environment on homicides, which are numerically dominated by homicides of men, has identified several key structural and other characteristics, such as per capita income and social cohesion, that influence risk independent of individual-level factors.  There is significantly less comparable data on homicides of women (femicides), though, which are more often perpetrated by intimate partners than are homicides of men. The objective of this paper is to examine the contribution of neighborhood factors to the likelihood of intimate partner femicide as compared with non-intimate partner femicide and unknown cause femicide, using social disorganization and feminist theories as frameworks for investigation. Using surveillance data on 1058 femicides occurring between 1990 and 1999 and archival data on 59 New York City neighborhoods, we conducted a multi-level case-control analysis using hierarchical regression methods.  In our analysis, neighborhood per capita income was negatively associated with intimate partner femicide risk.  No other neighborhood characteristic, such as social cohesion, was statistically significantly associated with risk of intimate partner femicide as compared with non-intimate partner femicides and unknown cause femicides, above and beyond the contributions of individual-level factors.  The strongest predictor of intimate partner femicide risk was individual-level foreign-born status. We discuss the implications of these results for future research, theory and practice."
0,"Law school socialization primarily emphasizes the cultivation of a professional identity.  However, nonwhite individuals, and especially the offspring of recent immigrant groups, have a difficult time separating from their schooling race, ethnicity, socioeconomic history, or immigrant background.  Simultaneously, race is injected into law school through a lack of critical racial analyses, professors’ commentary, and perceptions about meritorious admissions.  Feeling alienated from standard law school culture, Asian American and Latino law students join respective racialized organizations where pan-ethnic peers surround them.  Pan-ethnic student organizations become a support system for nonwhite students who are anxious about their legal education.  These organizations exist to provide academic support, professional networking opportunities, and events to socialize with peers who are Asian or Latino/Hispanic, become attached to respective pan-ethnic identities.  Drawing on over 15-months of observations at student organization meetings, interviews with 85 law students, and analysis of student organization listserv correspondences, I argue that contrary to law schools’ colorblind agenda, attending law school actually heightens students’ own awareness about race, ethnicity, and immigrant background.  Pan-ethnic organizations exist in law school to provide academic support, professional guidance, and social networking, but they also contribute to the unintentional racialization of Asian American and Latino law students."

0,"Most pregnant women in the United States today choose a normative physician-guided pregnancy followed by a medically managed hospital birth. Some, however, choose the care of a midwife during pregnancy and birth, whether in the hospital or, more rarely, at home. Despite growing research on both these paths, a third option chosen by some women has rarely been studied: a planned birth at home with neither a doctor nor a midwife assisting. In this article, I examine the stories told by women in this under-researched population to consider how they make and explain this highly unusual choice. Analysis of online birth stories and in-depth interviews with women who planned and had an unassisted homebirth reveal ways in which these women rely on competing discourses of midwifery and medicine to craft a unique sense of agency in birth."
0,"Research suggests that minority students have greater academic success if their teachers engage in a culturally relevant pedagogy.  Teachers that emphasize academic achievement, cultural competence, and sociopolitical consciousness are identified as drawing from this pedagogy. Small samples have limited past researchers ability to identify characteristics of teachers and school contexts where culturally relevant pedagogy is likely to occur.  Using surveys from Chicago Public School teachers, this research fills the gap in the literature by quantifying the concept of culturally relevant pedagogy and identifying teacher and school contextual predictors.  Findings indicate that teacher characteristics, professional training, classroom attributes, curriculum control, and parent-teacher cooperation all serve as predictors of culturally relevant pedagogy."
0,"This study combines qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the impact of organizational identity on organizational restructuring at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  Although CAS strived for the ideal identity of an autonomous scientific institution, the state pushed it into business activities in the 1980s.  Business firms, especially those that earned profits without conducting research and development (R&D), caused scientists’ anxiety of organizational distinction.   Scientists’ pursuit of the scientific identity led to the reform of “Knowledge Innovation,” during which firms that only had profits but no R&D were most likely to be discontinued (they were even more likely to be discontinued than firms that had neither profits nor R&D).  By contrast, firms that had both profits and R&D were least likely to be closed because they were consistent with CAS’s positive distinction."

Three trends have been suggested by recent literature: convergence, divergence, and parallel movement.  To evaluate these trends we examine 79 political and social attitudes clustered in 10 broad dimensions from the 1990 and 2000 World Value Surveys for each country.  Our results indicate that, on 85 percent of these issues, public opinion in the U.S. and Canada is either converging or moving in similar directions."
0,"Despite sociology's longstanding interest in inequality, the internalization of racial oppression among the racially subordinated and its contribution to the reproduction of racial inequality has been largely ignored, reflecting a taboo on the subject. Consequently, internalized racism remains one of the most neglected and misunderstood components of racism. In this article, the author argues that only by defying the taboo can sociology expose the hidden injuries of racism and the subtle mechanisms that sustain White privilege. After reviewing the concept and providing examples of the phenomenon, the author draws on critical social theory to examine reasons for the taboo, such as a theoretical fixation on resistance, a penchant for racial essentialism, and the limitations of an identity politics. The author concludes by offering a method for studying internalized racism and resistance concurrently within the matrix of intersecting forms of oppression."
0,"This study suggests that multitasking constitutes an important source of gender inequality, which can help explain previous findings that mothers feel more burdened and stressed than do fathers even when they have relatively similar workloads. Using data from the 500 Family Study, including surveys and the Experience Sampling Method, the study examines activities parents simultaneously engage in and how they feel when multitasking. We find that mothers spend 10 more hours a week multitasking compared to fathers and that these additional hours are mainly related to time spent on housework and childcare. For mothers, multitasking activities at home and in public are associated with an increase in negative emotions, stress, psychological distress, and work-family conflict. By contrast, fathers' multitasking at home involves less housework and childcare and is not a negative experience. We also find several similarities by gender. Mothers' and fathers' multitasking in the company of a spouse or children are positive experiences, whereas multitasking at work, although associated with an increased sense of productivity, is perceived as a negative experience."
0,"Becoming parents is a key event in couples lives and a major change in new parents lives is in the division of labor because the transition to parenthood brings a tremendous increase in family work. Much research studying changes in the domestic division of tasks is based on crossectional analyses or in other words at one moment in the relation, focusing on differences between couples. However, in order to conclude anything about an actual change in division of tasks within a couple after childbirth, one needs longitudinal panel data. With help of Dutch longitudinal panel data we describe and explain actual changes. Existing explanations for the division of domestic labor mostly refer to the relative productivity and relative social-economic resources of the spouses or to their cultural socialization. The change in parenthood forms an important opportunity to test the relative importance of economic resources versus attitudes on the division of household tasks before and after the transition to parenthood. Overall, most couples experience a change to a more unequal division of domestic labor after childbirth. After childbirth, especially higher educated men change their contribution strongly. Furthermore, womens resources are more important for an equal division after childbirth than are his. And we found that more egalitarian orientations do lead to a more equal division, but the influence of economic resources becomes larger after childbirth and exceeds the influence of attitudes."
0,"This study utilizes survey data (n = 421) collected from repatriated migrants in Mexico to examine the facilitation of unauthorized crossing attempts through southern Arizona, an area that has become the most important crossing corridor along the southern border.  This study uses various measures of migration-specific cultural, social, and human capital to explicate crossing modes.  Interestingly, no women reported having crossed alone, which appears to be consistent with previous findings.  Further, women were more likely to cross with a coyote than with family or friends when compared to men, net of all other factors.  Contrary to findings from extant studies, results suggest a curvilinear relationship between age and mode of crossing when controlling for all other covariates, with younger and older migrants being more likely to cross with others than alone.  Previous work has called for the differentiation between coyote types in analyses of crossing modes.  However, this study found no statistically significant difference between “border business” and “interior” coyotes.  This may be due to the emerging hierarchical nature of the way coyote business is conducted in southern Arizona resulting from increased competition between drug cartels and coyotes in this contested region.  This complex matter deserves further systematic research."
0,"Sense of control is the sense of manipulating ones own life. Previous research has demonstrated that education could raise sense of control. However, sociologists have not provided consistent evidence about the association between race and sense of control. Based on Aging, Status, and Sense of Control (ASOC) 1995 data, I use OLS regression models to examine the differentials in sense of control between whites and non-whites as well as the interaction effect on sense of control between race and education. Although this study does not provide evidence supporting that whites have higher sense of control than non-whites, I find that education affects sense of control of whites and non-whites differently. Although education could boost sense of control of whites, it slightly reduces sense of control of non-whites."
0,"As a result of rapid increases in the costs for outpatient prescription drugs, health insurance companies developed or contracted with pharmaceutical benefit management companies (PBMs) to perform a host of cost saving practices, including preapproval of prescriptions, before the drug is dispensed to the patient.  Approval could be limited to the companys official list of approved drugs, or require significantly higher patient copayments for high cost drugs.  Patients upset with non coverage or a high copayment were advised to contact the prescribing doctor and consider if a PBM-suggested alternative drug was acceptable.  This paper explores how the growth and wide acceptance of the Internet, as well as resulting cost savings made possible the preapproval of outpatient drugs and how this practice may be affecting physician autonomy."
0,"Prioritizing husbands' careers over wives' careers should theoretically constrain wives' career advancement and contribute to the gender wage gap. However, past research has not systematically tested how career priority in decision-making affects decision outcomes. This paper is the first to offer a behavioral operationalization of career prioritizing in family migration decisions and test whether the prioritized spouse indeed experiences better relative outcomes. I analyze dual-earner couples' reports on 73 decisions about whether and where to move. As predicted, husbands' careers fare better than their wives' careers when he has a job lined up before the decision made, when he finds a job before she does, when only the wife makes a job change, and when his career is given as the main reason for choosing that option. Decisions resulting in moves are relatively better for husbands than for wives, compared to decisions not to move. Surprisingly, spouses' relative career gains are not significantly related to whose career initiated the situation, or whether the wife had a job lined up."
0,"Large-scale dam and infrastructure projects remain common and controversial means toward development and poverty reduction in the Global South. Development authorities often promote employment of local people as part of development and as a promise made to ""sell"" projects locally. Are these promises of employment fulfilled? And what are the race, class, and gendered consequences of the employment practices implemented at the sites of large-scale development projects? How the social organization of work at the sites of large-scale development projects may create and constitute particular dynamics of inequality has been understudied. This article analyzes the social organization of work at one dam site of a large-scale multidam infrastructure development project, the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP). Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in 1997 and 2000-2002 in two communities proximate to Katse Dam, I center my analysis on the social organization of work with two goals: first, I render visible the gendered, classed, and raced ways that bodies and labor are organized in the context of this megaproject, both producing and constituting global and local inequalities; and, second, I show how masculinities are mobilized hierarchically to privilege an international hegemonic masculinity over local masculinities, and how the gender order is largely maintained by excluding women from the ""privileges"" of development through keeping women second-class citizens. These conclusions raise critical questions regarding how work is organized at the sites of large-scale development projects, and suggest we give greater attention to how the sites of development may reproduce inequalities based in race, class, gender, and global status."
0,"This paper employs a discourse analysis to examine the practices of consumption that occur within the fields of the environment and health with a specific emphasis on how such practices are portrayed and engaged with at the cultural level. It is argued that conventional over/under-consumption accounts of the relationship between consumption and environment and health issues tend to be overly simplistic and reductionist thereby failing to capture the important cultural and hegemonic nuances involved.  To address the limitations of such types of analyses we draw upon and apply the work of Pierre Bourdieu and Jean Baudrillard to help understand how such diverse cultural consumptive phenomena within the environment and health fields as -- nutritional, hygiene and exercise options; practices related to the aesthetics of nature such as camping, canoeing and other wilderness activities; government sponsored pro-environment initiatives; anti-aging regimes; and advertising campaigns -- may be understood in terms of a complex and dynamic configuration of cultural processes, including those related to: the struggle for social differentiation through consumption, the taken for granted/naturalizing influence of the habitus, and the process of signification and marginal difference. We conclude by noting how the cumulative effect of these processes may tacitly serve to hinder the potential to develop critical movements for social and environmental justice within the fields of environment and health."
0,"While much research has documented the pattern and extent of sex segregation of workers once they are employed, few studies have addressed the pre-hire mechanisms that are posited to produce sex segregation in employment. While the notion of a labor queue-the rank order of the set of people that employers choose among-plays a prominent role in pre-hire accounts of job sex sorting mechanisms, few studies have examined the ways in which job candidates are sorted into labor queues. In this paper, we explore the mechanisms by which labor queues contribute to the gendering of jobs by studying the hiring process for all jobs at a call center. Being placed in a queue has a clear gendering effect on the hiring process: the sex distribution of applicants who are matched to queues and those who are rejected at this phase diverge, and among those assigned to queues, women are prevalent in queues for low pay, low status jobs. The screening process also contributes to the gendering of the population of hires at this firm. Females are more prevalent among hires than they are among candidates at initial queue assignment. Among high status jobs, however, males are more prevalent than females. Moreover, there are important wage implications associated with matching to queues. While there are large between-queue sex differences in the paid wages associated with allocation to queues, once allocated to queues the wage differences between male and female candidates are nil. Consequently, the roots of gender wage inequality in this setting lie in the initial sorting of candidates to labor queues. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"This study explores legal consciousness around sexual harassment law by analyzing the treatment of token women at a predominantly-male cab company.  Men at this company labeled their token women co-workers and treated each woman differently based on her assigned label.  This resulted in two key effects.  First, women who were labeled ""heterosexual"" were sexually harassed.  Second, women who were labeled ""lesbian"" were not sexually harassed, but rather were avoided altogether.  The male co-workers legal consciousness encompassed an understanding of sexual harassment law that permitted them to harass the first group of women at the company, while distancing themselves from the other group.  The consequence for both groups of women was limited access to the more powerful members of the company, the male managers and dispatchers.  Thus, despite a rhetoric supporting equality and these womens civil rights, the mens actions resulted in a strengthening of the gender hierarchy in this predominantly male business."
0,"A notable feature of U. S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from ""elite"" backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily."
0,"Analyzing data from the 2007 Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan Inequality Survey, I identify and compare the determinants of economic justice attitudes in two formerly similar majority-Muslim nations that are now distinguished almost exclusively by their dissimilar economic circumstances following the collapse of the Soviet Union, In Kazakhstan, where the economy is growing rapidly, the important factors predicting economic egalitarianism are connected to people's perceived ability to do well in the future. In contrast, in Kyrgyzstan, which has stagnated in the post-Soviet era, people's immediate economic vulnerability predicts egalitarianism, while their economic prospects are irrelevant. Finally, the effect of several factors on support for egalitarianism appears impervious to the prevailing economic winds: religious orthodoxy, the urban vs. rural divide, and membership in a historically privileged ethnic group. These patterns reflect both the commonalities in the two countries' histories, demography, and religion and their divergent economic trajectories since the collapse of the USSR."
0,"A long-standing objective of friendship research is to identify the effects of personal preference and structural opportunity on intergroup friendship choice. Although past studies have used various methods to separate preference from opportunity, researchers have not yet systematically compared the properties and implications of these methods. This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The example also demonstrates the approach of conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine how parameter estimates vary by specification of the opportunity structure."
0,"Several recent studies have shown the mental health benefits of volunteering for volunteers; further, some of these have noted even greater benefits among older adults. Few studies, however, address why volunteering is beneficial for mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine how perceptions of volunteering efficacy affect the mental health of volunteers. Specifically, two perspectives are tested: (1) self-rewarding, which emphasizes the benefits of the activity to the volunteer; and (2) others-rewarding, which emphasizes the benefits of the activity to those being helped. Using data from the first two waves of the American Changing Lives data set, the study shows that volunteers who endorse the others-rewarding perspective have better mental health outcomes than other volunteers; in contrast, those who support the self-rewarding perspective see no benefits for depression. With different age groups, the findings also indicate that the effect of others-rewarding perspective is strongest in young volunteer groups. Considering interaction terms, volunteer hours is negatively related to depression for old volunteers, but positively associated with mid-aged volunteers for both perspectives. Religious volunteering, however, is not related to depression except for mid-aged volunteers."
0,"A number of studies have identified gendered barriers for women to engage in the international world of science, yet many women professors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are nonetheless engaged in international research and collaborations. I argue that an important mechanism I call the “nationality bonus” works to support them. Women scientists experience that their gender becomes less salient in a foreign setting for several reasons, including that local gendered expectations and beliefs, for example, about women’s lack of competence in science do not apply to them as “foreigners.” Their status as scientists from a U.S. university is more salient than their gender. I draw on gender status theory (Ridgeway 2011) and modify it with intersectionality theory to explain this phenomenon. I develop the concept of “scientific nationality,” belonging to an academic national community, to explain in which transnational contexts the nationality bonus works. Data include in-depth interviews and focus groups with faculty in STEM fields engaged in international collaborations. The mechanism provides women scientists who go abroad with positive research experiences, and sometimes more freedom to be innovative than at home. Women can build international collaborations and networks to circumvent exclusionary networks at home.  The nationality bonus, however, only works in work-settings, in social settings, for example, evening entertainment, gender norms prevail."
0,"According to the United Nations (UN) access to Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) is the third most important issue affecting women globally, after poverty and violence (Hafkin and Taggart, 2001). ICTs have been touted as the panacea to address the development challenges facing women in the third world and in Africa in particular. According to Castells (1996) ICTs have the potential to be used by locally-based communities to represent themselves. Some have noted (Marcelle, 1999; Rathgeber and Adera, 2000) that ICTs could turn African women into decision makers and actors in the information society. It has been argued that for the first time, Africans living in remote areas could bring their perspectives, viewpoints and experience to the global marketplace of ideas and knowledge (Rathgeber, 2000). Nevertheless, the ICT discourse for gender and development in Africa has largely constructed African women as problems; as the other, as passive recipients and consumers of western communications products rather than active agents in the production and dissemination of ICTs. Similar to the development discourse, African women who are mostly in rural areas and non-literate are defined as obstacles to the growth of ICT access and development. This top down approach to knowledge production ignores local appropriation of technologies. In this paper I draw on Escobar (1995) and postcolonial feminists such as Mohanty and Ong (1988)s arguments about the construction of colonial and postcolonial representations of the south as the dependent 'other' and apply it to the ICT discourse utilized for gender and development in Africa by development organizations such as the United Nations."
0,"Homophily, the tendency for similar individuals to associate, is one of the most robust findings in social science. Despite this robustness, we have less information about how personal characteristics relate to differences in the strength of homophily. Nor do we know much about the impact of personal characteristics on judgments of relative dissimilarity. The present study compares the strength of age, religious, and educational homophily for male and female non-kin ties using network data from the 1985 General Social Survey. It also compares the patterning of ties among dissimilar alters for both sexes. The results of this exploratory effort indicate that males and females are almost equally homophilous, although religious homophily exerts a stronger influence on females than males. Males and females do, however, differ in their tendency to associate with certain types of dissimilar alters. Education is essentially uniform for both sexes, religious difference is more important for females than males, and those over sixty or under thirty are less different from the middle categories of age for females than for males. The results suggest that males are able to bridge larger areas of social space in their non-kin interpersonal networks and likely accumulate greater social capital as a consequence.

0,"From 1975 to 2005, the variance in incomes of American families with children increased by two-thirds. In attempting to explain this trend, labor market studies emphasize the rising pay of college graduates, while demographers typically highlight the implications of family structural changes across time. In this article, we join these lines of research by conceiving of income inequality as the joint product of the distribution of earnings in the labor market and the pooling of incomes in families. We develop this framework with a decomposition of family income inequality using annual data from the March Current Population Survey. Our analysis shows that disparities in education and single parenthood contributed to income inequality, but rising educational attainment and women employment offset these effects. Most of the increase infamily income inequality was due to increasing within-group inequality, which was widely shared across family types and levels of schooling."
0,"Literature that examines the conditions for developing states transition to democratic forms of governance forms the theoretical and ideological background of U.S.-based efforts to promote democracy abroad. What is the impact of the distribution of economic power on this policy-making process and its implemented outcomes? Work in power research by Domhoff, Abelson, Dye, and others supports Gramscis hypotheses in that capital interest shapes the intellectual production of a U.S. extended policy planning network. This implies an expansion of Robinsons assessment of U.S. democracy promotion. Grant projects that assist states research foundations in articulating capital interests, towards facilitating the implementation of neoliberal development models, may have hegemonic consequences for economic policy and democratic governance."
0,"There has been a concerted effort in the last three decades to identify early female sociologists and to add or restore their works to the sociological canon.  This effort has generated a substantial body of work, much of which examines the relationship between the women and men of the Chicago School in its early years (1892-1920).  Two primary assumptions about this relationship have emerged over the years: (1) the women were frustrated sociologists; frustrated by a lack of acceptance in the discipline and a department run by men; and (2) the women were displaced sociologists, forced out of the discipline by the men into disciplines such as household administration and social work.  This paper examines these assumptions through a case study of the life and work of Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge.  Breckinridge is among those characterized by the literature as a frustrated and displaced sociologist, but Breckinridges own words to a friend, Please dont think of me as a sociologist, suggest that this was not always the case."
0,"Both the world-economy perspective in sociology and the world politics perspective in political science recognize the importance of examining the rise and fall of world powers, and generally agree on the main causal mechanisms responsible for the rise and fall process. However, there is much less convergence between these perspectives on the indicators used to measure the relative power of nation-states. Thus, although in agreement over theory, there is much less agreement on the identity and timing of hegemonies. This article attempts to overcome this impasse by creating a hegemony index to assess the power structure of the capitalist world-system. Though results support the world-economy view of three hegemons since the 16th century, findings also contradict this perspective and show that England is the most powerful nation during two successive hegemonic sequences. Conclusions highlight the possibility of hegemonic resuccession, while supplementary analysis provides evidence of U.S. resuccession since the 1980s."
0,"This article revives the debate over whether women's upward mobility prospects decline as they climb organizational hierarchies. Although this proposition is a core element of the ""glass ceiling"" metaphor, it has failed to gain strong support in previous research. The article establishes a firm theoretical foundation for expecting an increasing female disadvantage, with an eye toward defining the scope conditions and extending the model to upper-level external hires. The approach is illustrated in an empirical setting that meets the proposed scope conditions: corporate law firms in the United States. Results confirm that in this setting, the female mobility disadvantage is greater at higher organizational levels in the case of internal promotions, but not in the case of external hires."
0,"This paper focuses on the emergent form of economic segmentation and its impact on gender segregation and gender-based earnings differentials in urban China. I argue that a new logic of economic segmentation has emerged during the market transition, altering the relative amount of economic returns to jobs, changing the structural features of job queues. As a result, new patterns of gender segregation emerged. To test this hypothesis, I use data at three levels: a 1995 national sample of individual workers, industry-sector data for 1990 and 1995, and city-level data for 1995. The findings indicate that gender segregation follows the new logic of economic segmentation introduced by the marketization: male workers have penetrated into jobs that have gained in earnings while squeezing out female workers from these high-paying jobs; driven out of lucrative jobs, female workers made inroads into the state sector, now that this sector is becoming differentiated and that its relative economic advantage wanes. Further analysis based on a series of multilevel cross-classified models suggests that in the most marketized cities, workers of both sexes in jobs with high rates of female entry are penalized in earnings, indicating that the negative effect of job feminization on earnings accentuates in the most marketized cities."
0,"The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on ""detainee abuse"" at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) ""constructionist analytics,"" I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that ""really occurred"" throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems."
0,"Research on psychological adjustment to late-life spousal loss is distinguished by one critical omission: studies of racial differences in reactions to loss are nearly absent from the literature. To fill this void, I examine: (1) whether spousal loss affects depression and anxiety levels differently for black and white older adults; (2) whether newly bereaved black and white older adults experience different grief symptomatology; and (3) the extent to which black-white differences in spousal grief are explained by four theoretically-informed pathways: marital quality; religious participation; social support from children; and social support from friends and distant relatives. Analyses are based on data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC), a prospective study of widowhood among men and women ages 65 and older. The results show that widowed older adults have higher levels of depression than their married peers do, yet this relationship does not differ for blacks and whites. Among older widowed persons, blacks and whites report similar levels of overall grief, yearning, intrusive thoughts, shock, depression, and anxiety, while blacks report significantly lower levels of anger and despair than whites. The racial gap in anger is fully explained by blacks higher levels of religious participation and commitment.  African Americans lower levels of despair are partially explained by their less traditional, and more conflicted late marriages. These findings suggest that psychological adjustment to late-life spousal loss is contingent upon long-established patterns of social participation and marital interaction."
0,"Social protection is the ability of a government to insulate its citizens from the problems associated with poverty and market forces that negatively affect their quality of life. Prior research shows that government policies that provide social protection moderate the influence of inequality on national homicide rates. Recent research, however, reveals a strong association between poverty and national homicide rates. Further, theory and evidence suggest that social protection policies are meant to alleviate the vagaries of poverty, not inequality, and to aid in providing a subsistence level of living. To this point, however, no studies have examined the potentially moderating effect of social protection on the strength of the association between poverty and homicide rates cross-nationally. We do so in the present study. Employing data for the year 2004 from a sample of 30 nations, we estimate a series of weighted least squares regression models to test three hypotheses: the association between poverty and homicide will remain significant and positive when controlling for social protection, social protection will have a significant negative direct effect on national homicide rates, and social protection will condition the strength of the poverty-homicide association. The results provided evidence supporting all three hypotheses. We situate our findings in the cross-national empirical literature on social structure and homicide and discuss our results in the theoretical context of social protection."
0,"This study examined the relationship between bodily comportment (tattoos and grooming) and the likelihood of going to college among a national sample of 11,010 adolescents gathered as part of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Results show that adolescents with tattoos and those judged as poorly groomed by Add Health interviewers were significantly less likely to go to college after graduating from high school. These effects were similar in magnitude to those of other well-known demographic correlates of educational attainment, including family SES and family structure. Results also show that involvement in deviant activities accounted for much of the lower likelihood of going to college among adolescents with tattoos. Similar results were observed across gender, SES, and race groups, with the exception of Asians, for whom the lower likelihood of going to college among those with tattoos was especially pronounced. Overall, this study supports the conclusion that bodily signs constitute an important and relatively untapped source of information for predicting college matriculation among adolescents."
0,"In this paper, I analyze how the association between Mexico-U.S. migration and marriage varies across socioeconomic settings in origins. Using Mexican Migration Project data and employing bilevel survival analysis with controls for socioeconomic, migrant network, and marriage market characteristics and family size, I find that single people are most likely to migrate relative to those married in areas of recent industrialization, where the Mexican patriarchal system is weaker and economic opportunities for both men and women make post-marital migration less attractive. Marital status is not significant in agriculture-dependent areas, where the bargaining power of husbands might be higher relative to other settings; their age-profiles of earnings flatter: and remunerated female work scarcer, making migration attractive later in the life course.

0,"There are widely divergent views on how science and technology are connected to environmental problems. A view commonly held among natural scientists and policy makers is that environmental problems are primarily technical problems that can be solved via the development and implementation of technological innovations. This technologically optimistic view tends to ignore power relationships in society and the political-economic order that drives environmental degradation. An opposed view, common among postmodernist and poststructuralist scholars, is that the emergence of the scientific worldview is one of the fundamental causes of human oppression. This postmodernist view rejects scientific epistemology and often is associated with an anti-realist stance, which ultimately serves to deny the reality of environmental problems, thus (unintentionally) abetting right-wing efforts to scuttle environmental protection. We argue that both the technologically optimistic and the postmodernist views are misguided, and both undermine our ability to address environmental crises. We advocate the adoption of a critical materialist stance, which recognizes the importance of natural science for helping us to understand the world while also recognizing the social embeddedness of the scientific establishment and the need to challenge the manipulation of science by the elite."
0,"Over the last two decades feminist scholars have been theorizing about the centrality of race, class, and gender in daily life. Although theorizing about the interlocking nature of race, class, and gender oppression has resulted in exciting new epistemological frameworks, feminist researchers have yet to articulate concrete strategies for capturing this intersectionality empirically. Using examples from our own research in Cuba, we build upon previous feminist epistemological insights and begin to develop methodological principles that can be used to capture the intersection of race, class, and gender in the context of cross-cultural research."
0,"Vaccines are often heralded as one of the greatest success stories of modern medicine. Yet public concerns have surfaced recently, in part because of the declining incidence of many target diseases, but also in response to increasing questions about safety. Public health messages designed to encourage vaccination often assume that parents are unaware of the risks and consequences of the diseases; that those who harbor doubts or reservations about vaccine safety are irrational, emotional, or laboring under misconceptions; or that skeptics are being manipulated by a well-orchestrated campaign by antivaccination groups. This project explores how parents assess probabilistic information on vaccine risks and benefits and what may drive them to consider some possible outcomes as worst cases, leading them to deviate from official recommendations. Semistructured interviews with 20 parents indicate that parents employ both probabilistic and possibilistic thinking, but that the contextual factors that influence their interpretation of that information vary. Trust is an especially important contextual factor; parents struggling with vaccination decisions describe the importance of trust at multiple levels-in the vaccine, in their doctor, and in the broader public health policy network."
0,"Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging, this study examined the relationship between social support and mortality among older people with diabetes. Results of survival analyses showed that social support was strongly associated with mortality. With all things being equal, compared to people with a low level of social support, the risk of death is 41 percent lower among people with medium levels of support and 55 percent lower among those with highest levels of support (p<0.05). We also found that the effect of social support on mortality is mediated by both physical and mental health status. Based on findings from this study, social support should be considered an important target for intervention to reduce mortality risk among older adults with diabetes"
0,"Drawing on a review of literature, documentary analysis, interviews and reflections drawn from personal experience, and using selected case illustrations, the paper presents an overview of the development of the drugs problem in the UK since 1979. It describes the way social research has contributed: firstly to understanding the new problem; then to the development of the harm-minimisation approach; then to the criminalisation of drugs policy.  It notes the influence of methodological developments, both quantitative and qualitative: ethnographic work assisted in understanding cultures of drug-taking; repeat surveys identified the increasing salience of the fear of crime in local communities; health economists assessed the cost of crime and the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Social research helped both to support policy development and to resist challenges. In particular, it has played a key role in New Labour policies over the past ten years. At varying points in this thirty year history, social scientists have acted either as critics of policy or as technical assistants to those charged with managing the problem. The declining significance of Sociology within the British policy debate at national level is noted and some explanations offered."
0,"The phenomenal expansion of global trade in the postwar period is subject to various interpretations. Some stress its novel features in producing global integration, while others insist on the role of traditional non-economic factors in shaping a continuously fragmented world. This study employs the gravity model estimated by the two-step fixed and random effects model (2SFRM) to analyze global bilateral trade data between 1950 and 2000. Its findings show that although new economic and global institutional factors do promote bilateral trade, geographic and cultural proximity generates increasingly strong affinities that draw countries together, which triggers a clustering process along geographic or cultural lines. Taken together, this paper foresees continuously fragmented world trade with qualificationsthe world economy is indeed becoming more trade-generating due to improved transportation and communications technology and institutionalized global governance; however, at the same time, some blocs of countries are developing strong cohesion among themselves through geo-cultural affinities. The persistence of geographic and cultural dimensions within bilateral trade calls for a more sophisticated perspective on gravitational attraction in the world economy."

The United States Woman Suffrage movement was one such movement that employed various movement strategies in order to attain full voting rights for women.  Although some movement activists felt that experimenting with partial suffrage would ease the fears of the electorate, making full suffrage more acceptable over time, other suffragists argued that partial suffrage activities would detract from the primary goal of helping women achieve equal voting rights with men.  Using bill and legislative data collected from primary sources in each of the 48 contiguous states, we explore whether 1) partial suffrage legislation competed with full suffrage legislation therefore reducing full suffrage legislative success, or 2) partial suffrage facilitated the passage of full suffrage by legitimizing the idea of woman suffrage.  Resource mobilization, policy legacies, and diffusion processes are considered in the analysis.  Variations in full and partial suffrage passage suggest that partial suffrage legislation did not have the legitimating effects within states that many suffragists who encouraged the use of partial suffrage hoped it would have.  The results do support the idea that woman suffrage success was the result of a gradual process of social change, in which womens political participation gained greater legitimacy as more states granted full women suffrage and experienced positive results."
0,"While much research defines mainstream kitsch art, little explores characteristics of an alternative middle-class art.  Based on an intersectional analysis of marketing and interest, this article explores how kitsch is comprised of multifarious aesthetics, which objectify varying manifestations of American cultural idioms.  Through a comparative, qualitative content analysis of promotions of contemporary American artists, our findings suggest a distinctive Racial Americana aesthetic countering mainstream Americana kitsch.  Themes of Racial Americana aesthetic reflect traditional stereotypes, including Black history, celebrity figures, and rural culture.  Americana aesthetic appeals to color-blind audiences, with themes including patriotism, faith, inclusivity, and idyllic home scenes.  Both aesthetics embody themes differentiating them as “kitsch,” including commercialization, transparent appeals to senses, and nostalgia.  Through differing lenses, both represent faith and family.  Quantitative analysis of consumer interest suggests regionally-differentiated prospective consumer bases, with associated demographic characteristics dividing consumer interest between Americana and Racial Americana according to race, class, and gender."
0,"Previous research suggests that higher incomes, safe workplaces, job security and healthcare access all contribute to favorable health. Reflecting the interest of economic and political sociologists in power relations and institutions, union membership has been linked with many such influences on health. Nevertheless, the potential relationship between union membership and health has received little attention. Using logistic regression and propensity score matching, this study examines the association between union membership and self-rated health generally and among select subgroups of the workforce with the General Social Survey from 1973 to 2006. Initial bivariate analyses suggest that union membership is actually associated with worse health. This association disappears when controlling for demographics, then reverses and becomes significant when controlling for labor market characteristics. In well-specified models, union membership has a significant positive effect on favorable self-rated health. The effect roughly offsets the effects of five years of aging or being divorced (as opposed to married). In addition, propensity score matching analyses demonstrate that union membership has a beneficial, significant average treatment effect for the treated. We show that much of union membership's effect in the overall sample is due to the mechanism of higher incomes, but that among men, the less educated, and those with lower incomes, the union-health advantage is not explained fully by income. The effect of union membership also appears to be stable over time. We conclude by encouraging further research on how power relations and institutions shape health."
0,"Today, boys generally underperform relative to girls in schools throughout the industrialized world. Building on theories about gender identity and reports from prior ethnographic classroom observations, we argue that school environment channels conceptions of masculinity in peer culture, fostering or inhibiting boys' development of anti-school attitudes and behavior. Girls' peer groups, by contrast, vary less strongly with the social environment in the extent to which school engagement is stigmatized as un-feminine. As a consequence, boys are more sensitive than girls to school resources that create a learning-oriented environment. To evaluate this argument, we use a quasi-experimental research design and estimate the gender difference in the causal effect of peer socioeconomic status (SES) as an important school resource on test scores. Our design is based on the assumption that assignment to 5th-grade classrooms within Berlin's schools is as good as random, and we evaluate this selection process with an examination of Berlin's school regulations, a simulation analysis, and qualitative interviews with school principals. Estimates of the effect of SES composition on male and female performance strongly support our central hypothesis, and other analyses support our proposed mechanism as the likely explanation for gender differences in the causal effect."
0,"Theory suggests that neighborhood effects depend not only on where individuals live today, but also on where they lived in the past. Previous research, however, usually measures neighborhood context only once and does not account for length of residence, thereby understating the detrimental effects of long-term neighborhood disadvantage. This study investigates effects of duration of exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods on high school graduation. It follows 4,154 children in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, measuring neighborhood context once per year from age 1 to 17. The analysis overcomes the problem of dynamic neighborhood selection by adapting novel methods of causal inference for time-varying treatments. In contrast to previous analyses, these methods do not ""control away"" the effect of neighborhood context operating indirectly through time-varying characteristics of the family; thus, they capture the full impact of a lifetime of neighborhood disadvantage. We find that sustained exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods has a severe impact on high school graduation that is considerably larger than effects reported in prior research. We estimate that growing up in the most (compared to the least) disadvantaged quintile of neighborhoods reduces the probability of graduation from 96 to 76 percent for black children, and from 95 to 87 percent for nonblack children."
0,"A comprehensive approach to health policy ought to address how the press frames certain policies as favorable or unfavorable.  Further, to assume that there is a monolithic press in the United States does not consider the potential variation that newspapers provide for across a variety of comparative categories: prestige versus non-prestige press; larger versus smaller newspapers; and the potential influence of state-level factors on coverage.  This project will consider the latter by analyzing newspaper coverage of New York Citys successful proposal to ban smoking in all bars and restaurants.  This tobacco control initiative was hotly contested, both in New York City and nationwide.  Using an inductively-derived, theoretically-driven coding protocol, this projects aims to consider: the resonant frames that the media drew upon in its coverage of NYCs smoking ban; the role that tobacco farming in a states economy played in how the effort was framed in the local press; and a comparison of coverage in communities which had recently passed similar anti-smoking legislation with those that had not.  Four major frames emerged around which the coverage was organized: Economics; Health, American Ideology; and Image of Cool.  This project will consider the ramifications of these findings for other studies of mass media and health policy."
0,"Presently, African American students are more likely to drop out of school, obtain poor grades, occupy non-academic tracks, and score lower on standardized test when compared to white students (U.S. Department of Education 2005).  Questions have been raised by researchers about the ability of the current teaching force (which is over 90% white) to adequately meet the needs of the growing number of African American and non-white student populations. Qualitative researchers suggest that attitudes about race/ethnicity shape the way that teachers interact with students; that less tolerant racial attitudes can lead to negative treatment and/or unequal social and academic outcomes for many minority students. To date, no studies have systematically examined and documented the racial attitudes of teachers specifically as a group.  This study uses the 1994-2004 General Social Surveys to address this gap in the literature by providing an accurate portrait of current white teachers racial attitudes.  Findings suggest that teacher racial attitudes are similar to, and in some cases less tolerant than the racial attitudes of the general population. Implications and directions for future research are discussed."
0,"It has been fifteen years since Hagan (1991) challenged researchers to integrate research on delinquency and stratification. Surprisingly, relatively few researchers have sought to understand the way in which adolescent delinquency influences later life outcomes. Using data from three waves of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) this paper investigates the way adolescent delinquent and socializing attitudes and behaviors impact subsequent educational outcomes. Preliminary analyses indicate that delinquent behavior has a negative effect on educational outcomes for both males and females. Both socializing attitudes and behaviors have a positive effect on educational outcomes only for females."
0,"Much previous research examining attitudes toward women in the public sphere has combined attitudes toward women in the workforce, politics, and higher education into a single scaled measure. However, contemporary characteristics of nations and their political histories may differentially shape attitudes towards women’s role in politics and women’s need for higher education. This paper uses the 2000 World Values Survey and hierarchical models to examine attitudes towards women in politics and women in higher education across thirty-six diverse nations. Findings show that women’s share of parliament is a strong positive predictor of attitudes toward women in both politics and higher education, controlling for a Muslim plurality, whether the country is currently communist or has a communist legacy, level of democracy, and whether or not the country has a post-1900 colonial history.  However, a post-1900 colonial history has a significant negative effect on attitudes toward women in politics, but does not have a significant effect on attitudes toward women in higher education. Researchers should be aware that contextual factors may not influence all dimensions of gender ideology uniformly."
0,"Theorists argue that service economies have relatively high inequality because dichotomies have developed between manufacturing and service industries, and between knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive service industries. Researchers, however, have not adequately tested hypotheses arising from this theory. We overcome this weakness by examining, hierarchically, the effects of service industry employment and the size of Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) industries on individuals' income in metropolitan statistical areas. Using the 2002 Current Population Survey, we find that dichotomies exist among industries in the service economy that help generate high incomes among upper-echelon occupations, particularly in the knowledge-intensive services and manufacturing industries. These incomes, however, are not available to laborers and service workers. Furthermore, we find that FIRE industry size impacts the wages of managers and service workers in more complicated ways than previously theorized. These findings help clarify the contours of stratification in the contemporary service-oriented economy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Preferences for the racial neighborhood composition differ significantly between blacks and whites. Since [Schelling, Thomas. C. 1969. Models of Segregation. Memorandum RM-6014-RC. The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30, 185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this process empirically through a case study of a university housing system that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact, residence assignment procedures are completely ""color-blind."" Thus a college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference has important consequences for the residential separation process. "
0,"Why did some Americans volunteer to provide relief to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack victims, their families, or workers? This paper uses data from the 2002 Religion and Public Activism Survey, a nationally representative sample of adult Americans, which show that 10 percent of Americans volunteered to help victims of the terrorist attacks in some way to address this question. We argue that the act of volunteering in response to September 11 depended on levels of identification with victims of the tragedy. One of the strongest factors was personal identification with victims, which was built through personal networks such as knowing someone who was killed or in danger during the attacks, and through personal feelings of responsibility to help others in need. Identification was also constructed through involvement in social events such as community candlelight vigils that reflected on, framed, and reinforced the significance of the disaster in a communal setting. In addition, identification with victims was built through a patriotic response to the tragedy, which, we argue, motivated Americans to defend the society with which they were emotionally identified and to see victims as part of the American family to which they were obligated to help in times of need. We argue that emotions matter for disaster relief, but that sorrow rather than anger is important for generating identification with victims and thus volunteering for 9/11 relief efforts. These arguments are used to explain gender and political party differences in 9/11 volunteering. Finally, embeddedness in religious congregations promoted volunteering for 9/11 relief efforts."
0,"Patterns of and desires for subsistence and employment differ considerably among Iñupiat living in Northwest Alaska. Previous study has shown that males and females diverge in their aspirations for education, employment, and outmigration, for example – findings suggesting that the region could face increasing social, economic, and cultural pressures in coming decades as females are more likely to leave small communities in favor of stable, year-round work more likely to be located in more populated areas, while males may be more apt to remain in villages performing subsistence. This paper examines differences in four dependent variables associated with these issues from the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) across gender:  the number of subsistence activities respondents reported participating in during the previous year, the number of hours worked in the previous week in wage employment, whether respondents had considered moving elsewhere within the previous five years, and lifestyle aspirations for wage work only or one characterized by mixed wage and subsistence work. Findings illustrate considerable difference between men and women in factors affecting work patterns and desires, and point to a changing social landscape in the region."
0,"An important consequence of the economic structure transformations of recent decades is increased income inequality. While an extensive literature has explored the relationship between economic restructuring and inequality, the unique contribution of this article is that it develops and tests a model that explores the mechanisms by which this process occurs. Specifically, the intervening role of the income gap between the well-educated and those with lower levels of education (the educational income gap) and other moderating factors are explored. The 5 percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing was used in the analysis. The data provided strong support for the model. It was found that economic structure and the moderating variables were strongly related to the educational income gap, which in turn was strongly related to overall income inequality. Generally, both the educational income gap and overall income inequality were greater in geographic areas with higher proportions of the labor force employed in services, and both were lower where greater proportions of the labor force were employed in goods-producing industries."
0,"In their widely cited study, Shavit and Blossfeld report stability of socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment over much of the 20th century in 11 out of 13 countries. This article outlines reasons why one might expect to find declining class inequalities in educational attainment, and, using a large data set, the authors analyze educational inequality among cohorts born in the first two-thirds of the 20th century in eight European countries. They find, as expected, a widespread decline in educational inequality between students coming from different social origins. Their results are robust to other possible choices of method and variables, and the authors offer some explanations of why their findings contradict Shavit and Blossfeld's conclusions."
0,"I use panel data to empirically assess the effects of a variety of theoretically important structural factors on national level CO(2) emissions in the former Soviet republics, a context of de-modernization and peripheralization. Several theories address the effects of modernization on the environment, but they neglect to consider the environmental consequences of de-modernization. Unlike the trends in most other nations over the twentieth century, former Soviet republics in the 1990s saw their collective population size, economy, level of urbanization, level of industrialization, and international trade decline, and, thus, they provide an ideal context in which to assess the effects of de-modernization on the environment. In addition to the dramatic changes in economic and demographic factors, the size of the militaries of the former Soviet republics changed substantially during the 1990s, with some republics expanding their militaries while other were scaling theirs back. I take advantage of the substantial variation within the former Soviet republics, and assess the effects of militarization, in addition to economic and demographic factors, on CO(2) emissions. I find that de-modernization, as indicated by declines in GDP per capita and urbanization, led to declines in CO(2) emissions, countering claims that further modernization is necessary to resolve the environmental crisis. I also find that militarization has an effect on CO(2) emissions above and beyond that of economic development."
0,"Studies of gene-environment interplay typically focus on one environmental factor at a time, resulting in a constrained view of social context. The concept of environmental contingency is introduced as a corrective. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and qualitative comparative analysis, the authors focus on an example involving social capital, a gene associated with a dopamine receptor (DRD2), and educational continuation beyond secondary school. For boys, (1) DRD2 risk is associated with a decreased likelihood of school continuation; (2) one configuration of social capital-high parental socioeconomic status, high parental involvement in school, and a high-quality school-compensates for this negative relationship, consistent with environmental contingency; but (3) boys with DRD2 risk are less commonly observed in settings that are rich in social capital."
0,"This article examines the diffusion of protest tactics among social movement organizations (SMOs) through their collaboration in protest groups. Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs."
0,"This paper evaluates how the distribution of applicant and enrollee attributes at seven Texas universities changed after the Hopwood decision and the implementation of a policy guaranteeing admission to students with high class ranks. We analyze changes in the distributions of test scores and high school class ranks for underrepresented minority groups as well as white and Asian American applicants across institutions and between admission regimes. We show that these admissions policy changes, which have direct effects on only the most selective institutions, have substantial indirect effects at other institutions. Average test scores of applicants to less selective institutions rose following the change in admission criteria, as students with high test scores who did not qualify for the admission guarantee applied to a broader set of institutions. Furthermore, as the share of high rank applicants at UT-Austin rose, the pre-Hopwood assent in the test scores of their applicants stagnated. "
0,"Based on a qualitative case study of a multiyear, multicity attempt to forge community coalitions against substance abuse, this article analyzes three categories of organizational temporalities: cycles, event streams, and temporal style. Community initiatives based on collaboration, coalitions, and cooperation, projects that ""bring everyone to the table,"" provide an opportunity for naturalistic observation of the unanticipated, but analyzable, effects that emerge when mismatched organizational temporalities interact. This article lays out a theory of these emergent effects of interorganizational time conflicts in communities of organizations. The aim is not to argue for the primacy of temporal effects over other dimensions but to include them in a multidimensional view of the causes of problems encountered in multi-organization community initiatives."
0,"Integrating an analysis of fields into studies of social change provides a better understanding of the outcomes achieved by challengers. We demonstrate the value of field analysis through a case study of a social change effort regarding urban land use. An organization led by wealthy and well-connected individuals pressed city government and a powerful for-profit developer to incorporate progressive social goals into a new urban development project. We show how the organization was able to achieve success in the policy formation field but faced significantly more obstacles when trying to enter another field (policy implementation), despite its elite status. Thus, using fields to study the case can bolster scholars' understanding of elite power and status, as well as help explain outcomes. The advantages enjoyed by elites can be field specific rather than universal, and so do not translate automatically into successful challenge results."
0,"Beginning in 2000, proposed federal legislation and a string of executive orders issued by President George W. Bush sought to encourage further collaboration between church and state. These “faith-based initiatives” sparked considerable public, academic and political debate. While legislation ultimately stalled in Congress, the framing efforts of Evangelicals (including those within the Bush administration) were successful in other important ways, including: (1) the development and proliferation of frames, i.e., “symbolic packages,” consistent with Evangelical understandings of the role of religion in society and state, and (2) the alignment of these frames with the interests and values of non-evangelicals, thereby broadening public support for the faith-based initiatives. The findings are based on a systematic content analysis of print media coverage of the faith-based initiatives in three leading U.S. newspapers (2000-2005), combined with statistical analyses of 2005 Baylor Religion Survey data on public opinion regarding faith-based social services. The findings address important questions regarding the American Evangelical movement, contemporary church-state relations, and social movement outcomes."
0,"Anticipation can be seen subjectively as a primary emotion with the primarily cognitive funcction of exploring territory and acquiring resources from the environment. Anticipation requires, as Susan Cachel has shown, a kind of ""natural history"" as opposed to ""Machaevellian"" or ""social intelligence. In opposition to behavioral and drive-reduction theories, contemporary affective neuroscience has shown that anticipation, and exploration to model the envioronment, are basic drives. Jaak Panksepp, in particular, has presented a six-part defintion of the biologial basis of anticipation, his ""seeking"" system. Anticipation, and its seeking system, which makes possible prediction of consequences of intended actions, is shown to be the basis of all decision-making and an aspect of rationality."
0,"This paper aims to examine the existing work in the field of sociology of literature, and attempts to propose a different approach to employ literary texts within the field of sociology. Because the approach tries to look at literary texts and say something about the larger culture, it risks being confused with the traditional reflection theory. In this paper, I will first detail the two reflection theories that I argue have emerged from crude understandings of Marx and Durkheim, talk about their criticisms as well as the different approaches to culture that have emerged from those criticisms. Next, I will go on to explain that the rejection of the idea of reflection, which was very necessary, did not however come without certain costs. Finally, I will propose that a sophisticated understanding of culture can indeed enable us to look at literature and say something about the larger culture, without rendering culture to an unstructured array of free-floating ideas, beliefs and values."
0,"This article analyzes two recent trials of women accused of killing their infants. The legal strategies that employ gender of the defendant as a resource for constructing narratives of the offense are explored. This is achieved through analysis of discourses of the transcripts of the defendants' trials. Two salient discourses, patriarchal and paternalist, are identified in the article. Patriarchal discourses are characterized by the equation of womanhood and motherhood and by the overtness of the ranking of men over women. The paternalist gender management expresses itself in deference to the professional discourses that define motherhood medical, psychiatric, and administrative. The evidence presented suggests that maternal trials of crimes against children provide a conduit for discussion of the issues that matter - the place and importance of motherhood in contemporary society. What is taking place in these trials reflects cultural neurosis over the ambiguity with regard to the definitions of the foundational relationship of mother and child. The article suggests that the trials of mothers accused of harming their children are symbolic of the problems involved in the contemporary regulation of mothering."
0,"The substantial incorporation of people of color into government and quasi-government employment raises previously unexplored questions about the significance of race, class, and gender in street-level bureaucracies. Relying on interview data collected from black and Latino supervisors and caseworkers implementing welfare reform, I look at whether and how race and other social group memberships are deployed as tools in the delivery of casework services to black and Latino clients. Contrary to our assumptions about the level of impersonality entrenched in public bureaucracies, I find that most caseworkers and supervisors of color conceptualize and operationalize welfare reform in ways that link their goals and experiences as agency employees, members of racial communities, and implementers of social policy. They identify with the circumstances of their clients, but interpret the politics of welfare through not only racialized but also classed and gendered lenses. Consequently, they support and challenge clients of color in a variety of ways. In order to trace the origins of these strategies, I explore how the combination of institutional politics, environmental phenomenon, and black and Latino bureaucrats' personal histories contribute to their understanding of how they should do their jobs. This article suggests that not only inter-racial but also intra-racial politics inform institutional processes within street-level bureaucracies."

0,"Researchers have commonly invoked isolation from job opportunities as an explanation for persistence of gender and race inequality in the labor market, but few have examined whether access to information about job opportunities varies by race and gender. Findings from nationally representative survey data reveal significant white male advantage in the number of job leads received through routine conversations when compared to white women and Hispanics. Differences in social network resources (social capital) partly explain the deficit among Hispanics, but fail to account for the job lead gap between white women and men. Further analyses show that inequality in the receipt of job information is greatest at the highest levels of supervisory authority, where white males receive substantially more job leads than women and minorities."
0,"The increase in the bi/multiracial population in the United States has resulted in a surge of literature about racial identity, social psychological well-being and increasingly, family racial socialization.  Drawing on 16 in-depth interviews from a larger set of 60 interviews with black/white biracial Americans, this paper underscores the nuances of ethnicity by focusing on bi/multiracials with an immigrant parent and comparing them to their counterparts with two American parents who have thus been (racially) socialized in the United States.  Our findings show that respondents with at least one immigrant parent understand race differently, self-identify differently and navigate peer groups differently than biracials with two American parents.  These findings indicate the continuing significance of race in a population that has been deemed proof that racial boundaries are diminishing and racism no longer exists.  Furthermore, this study highlights how biracial Americans who have one immigrant parent, and who would seemingly have less racial awareness, also receive clear messages of racial superiority and inferiority, racial relations and racial inequality.  Hence, they are reluctant to be associated with both white and black racial backgrounds."
0,"Graduate training in developed countries is typical for scientists in the global periphery.  Owing to resource scarcities, collaboration is a common form of research for these same individuals.  Yet few studies have examined the linkage between graduate education and collaboration. We examine this question in a population of knowledge producers who have experienced the simultaneous influence of three scientifically strong training systems: Australia, Japan, and the U.S.  Data from face-to-face interviews with 312 scientists in two Philippine sites are used to explore the relationships between graduate education, Internet use, professional networks, and collaboration. We show that most collaboration is domestic, but the most common international collaborations are Japanese, followed by Australian, and finally U.S.  Japanese training, but not current professional networks, is associated with such collaborations, while U.S. and Australian training are unimportant to collaborations in these locations. We explain this by identifying two aspects integral to graduate education, mode of study and mentoring style, which may be critical to the development of durable professional ties and ultimately to collaborative work. Our results show that even among scientific training systems in developed areas, there are variations in scientific interaction and practices that have implications for differential participation in collaboration."
0,"In this article, the author examines pragmatic philosophy as a tool to open a richer dialogue between modern and postmodern depictions of reality. Exploring the pragmatic influences in the thoughts of G. H. Mead and Emile Durkheim (as well as C. Wright Mills and others), the author argues that ideas found in these theorist's writings, as they are informed by American Pragmatism, can act as a metaphorical bridge in linking modern and postmodern thought. In this context, the author shows that the functionalists and structuralists wrongly depict Durkheim and Mead as disciples of and inheritors of the Enlightenment project. Conversely, the postmodernists simply ignore them because they are wrongly perceived to be part of the totalizing, ""enemy"" camp of the Enlightenment tradition. The author asserts that a more accurate read of Durkheim and Mead finds a nuanced, middle ground in regards to opposition to versus submission to the Enlightenment project, and hence Durkheim and Mead (due in large part to American Pragmatism's influence in their writings) offer a way for modern and postmodern theory to enter into more fruitful dialogue with each other."
0,"This paper discusses several years of ongoing research of Dominican and Puerto Rican women and their relative commitment to religion over three generations. The first generation of our respondents were born and largely grew up in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The second and third generations grew up in New York and surrounding areas.  We further found a decline in Catholicism and an increased participation in Protestant religious groups often of the fundamentalist variety. Two possible explanations for this are that the Catholic church rarely had priests in the continental United States at least in the beginning of both immigrations who spoke Spanish.  Whereas fundamentalist religious groups were quick to use Spanish speaking religious figures and secondly, the fundamentalist religions may have seemed more appropriate for the new environment.  We also suspect that non-Christian practices such as Santeria and Voodou are more wide-spread among our respondents than they admitted to.  The denial of such non-Christian practices may have to do with the negative stigma attached to non-Christian practices."
0,"This paper investigates the sources of inequality in mainland China and Taiwan. With aggregated level data, it first demonstrates that the relationship between growth and inequality is captured by the left part of a Kuznets-curve in urban China and an opposite Kuznets-curve in Taiwan. By further using a variety of individual-level data, it shows that whereas urban China and Taiwan have comparable overall inequality, the labor market inequality structures are different. Gender gap and college/senior high school differentials in income were stably raised in urban China along its market reform, especially since 1992. In contrast, Taiwan has steadily declined its gender inequality over the past three decades and stopped to increase economic return to college credentials in the last twenty years. Empirical analysis also indicates that there were substantive within-group inequality by gender and education in the two region’s labor market inequality structures."
0,"The image of the mad scientist is embedded in our culture. It is called on and used frequently in politics and popular culture. In contrast, scientists consistently rate high in prestige in social surveys. This research examines the nature of images of scientists in movies during the period 1990-1994 and compares them to survey data about scientists and the effect of scientific work. Movies represent scientists and their work as problematic and often ineffective, but surveys show a majority of people see the results of science as generally beneficial. Contrasting these two images allows a first examination of the connection between these two representations and wider societal conflicts over the role of expert knowledge and modernity."
0,"A new approach to investigation of human influences on the environment identifies social organization as an influence independent of population size, affluence, and technology. The framework also identifies population events, such as births, that influence the environment. The authors use longitudinal, multilevel, mixed-method measures of local land use changes, population dynamics, and social organization to test this framework. These tests reveal that changes in social organization are strongly associated with changes in land use independent of measures of population size, affluence, and technology. Also, local birth events shape local land use changes and key proximate determinants of land use change."
0,"This research examines the relationship between work disability and food insecurity, and tests whether the positive association between disability and food insecurity is accounted for by two mechanisms: economic resources and/or competing consumption needs. A sample (N = 6997) is chosen from the 1999 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with over 1200 households headed by people with disabilities. Findings support both mechanisms but depending on the levels of food insecurity and the types of family economic resources, their success at explaining the relationship of disability with food insecurity varies. In addition, we find that household assets are more effective than income in protecting people with disabilities against food insecurity. Implications for disability policy and food assistance programs are discussed. "
0,"In this paper, the author extends and further develops research and theory on the relationship between cultural taste and social networks by examining the effects of strength of preference in different cultural domains on the relative closure of personal networks. The results show that as the number of strong preferences held by an individual increases, so do the chances that any two of his or her personal discussion network are connected to one another. In contrast, holding a larger number of weaker preferences results in personal discussion networks characterized by the presence of ""structural holes."" The author closes by pointing to the theoretical implications of these results."
0,"This study investigates racial differences in the short-term and long-term effect of living in public housing as a child on socioeconomic attainment among young adults from low-income families. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data and state-level public housing information, propensity score matching estimations addressed the self-selection problems encountered when evaluating the impact of welfare programs. The study findings indicate that Blacks with short-term public housing residence during adolescence seem to be more disadvantaged in terms of housing self-sufficiency and car ownership in an early adulthood than their low-income Black counterparts who lived in private housing. In the long run; however, public housing residence had very small effects on socioeconomic attainment of both White and Black young adults. The benefits of public housing in terms of providing a secure residence for economically vulnerable groups; therefore, outweigh any potential negative impacts. "
0,"This research considers the relationship between self-reported health and fear of crime. Fear of crime literature suggests women, the elderly, or the impoverished may experience heightened fear of crime. It is hypothesized that it is a sense of vulnerability that leads individuals to believe they would be unable to protect themselves should an attack occur, increasing their personal fear of crime. We argue in this article that poor self-reported health may also lead to a sense of vulnerability and elevate fear of crime. We test this hypothesis using data from the General Social Survey (GSS). Using a variety of health measures, our results indicate that some indicators of health are related to a heightened fear of crime and that this relationship varies by gender. Women are at a double disadvantage, in that they feel more vulnerable to crime than men, and women also have more negative perceptions of health."
0,"In this paper, I apply the concept of frame analysis as a tool for understanding what became widely known as “the UCI egg stealing scandal,” a medical dispute that beginning in 1995 epitomized assisted reproductive technology gone awry.   This now infamous case that continues today generated widespread publicity and numerous court cases with observers asking how was it possible that doctors from a highly regarded center for assisted reproductive technology could “steal” the eggs from one patient and implant them in another, resulting in some cases in pregnancies and births.  The notion of framing sheds light on the frame shifts and frame misalignment that provided the context for this unfortunate medical situation to occur.  Technological innovation, e.g., the cryopreservation of eggs and embryos, produced new ways of framing the harvesting and use of human eggs in infertility treatment as “ownership” and rendered previous “cooperative” and “sharing” frames for egg donation obsolete.  As new frames arose, various actors continued to operate within the old frames, leading to drastic misalignment, and severe emotional, social and legal consequences.  Frames have a temporal dimension, and in this paper I argue that the point at which actors encounter the frame impacts their allegiance to it, and further, their ability to recognize or embrace competing frames.  Framing furthers our understanding of an unfortunate case, and concomitantly, the analysis of what has come to be known as the “UCI egg stealing scandal” contributes to the further development of frame analysis in health care settings."
0,"Received wisdom, some sociological theory and a handful of qualitative studies suggest that the ""night shift"" of caregiving work that interrupts sleep is a burden borne disproportionately by women. However, there is no broadly representative evidence to substantiate claims about who takes the night shift in contemporary American households. Analyses using data from the nationally-representative 2003-2007 American Time Use Surveys show that net of age, paid work commitment, partnership status and the presence and age of dependents, working mothers were significantly and substantially more likely to get up for the night shift than working fathers. These results suggest that the sleeping hours, which make up a third of every day, are an understudied but important site for micro-level processes that reflect and reproduce gender stratification."
0,"In the years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, some 400 local governments passed ""Bill of Rights"" resolutions in opposition to the USA PATRIOT Act. Event history analyses show that cities with progressive profiles were markedly quicker to pass such resolutions. These effects are strongest in the early phase of the Bill of Rights campaign, a period for which there is also robust evidence of contagious influence among nearby cities. The authors argue that the campaign's success lies in the miscibility of multiple movements-the ability of groups with different beliefs, agendas, and traditions to combine around a common goal. The case is used to distinguish between strong and weak forms of miscibility and to develop insight into strategic, organizational, and political conditions that promote the construction of movement-spanning coalitions."
0,"The prospect of a good job with higher earnings motivates many students decision to seek a college degree.  Students take on jobs or internships during the summer to get a glimpse at possible career choices and perhaps to pave the way toward obtaining a job in that organization following graduation.  Because little is known about the types of summer jobs students hold while in college or how they obtained these jobs, this paper looks at job search methods, types of summer jobs, and salaries for a sample of nearly 4,000 black, white, Asian, and Hispanic students from 28 colleges and universities.  Of particular interest is the use of school based contacts to obtain employment, since it is these contacts that have the greatest potential to level the playing field for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Students who found their summer jobs through these institutional contacts had significantly higher earnings than students using most other methods (controlling for race, job category, prior work experience, and parental education).   These findings complement previous work on the implications of integration into college on college outcomes by showing that those who are more integrated are more likely to use institutional based ties to find their jobs, which yields summer jobs with better earnings than jobs found by other methods."
0,"This paper provides a brief overview of the central societal changes that have been illuminated by a quarter-century of research, using data from the annual Houston Area Survey, a longitudinal research project that since 1982 has tracked Americas fourth largest city in the process of fundamental transformation. Two months after the first Houston survey, the regions booming oil-based economy collapsed. The region recovered from deep recession in the mid-1980s to find itself squarely in the midst of a restructured economy and a demographic revolution. These 25 years of countywide, random-digit-dialed, computer-assisted telephone interviews have measured the demographic patterns, experiences, attitudes, and beliefs among successive representative samples of Harris County residents. The overall purpose of this continuing project is to assess the way the general public is responding to the ongoing transformations of urban America, and to make the survey findings readily available to the general public and to research scholars everywhere."
0,"Previous theory and research suggests that workplace gender composition at the highest organizational levels should play a crucial role in reducing gender linked inequalities in the workplace. In this article, we examine how the presence of women in top corporate positions influences female managerial representation at the establishment-level. Using a unique multi-level dataset of 5679 establishments nested within 81 Fortune 1000 corporations, we find that having more women on corporate boards, but not in executive positions, at the firm-level is associated with greater female managerial representation at the establishment-level. The results also show that women are more likely to be in management positions when employed in young, large, and managerially intensive workplaces, as well as those with a larger percentage of female non-managers. Implications for future research and policy implementation are discussed. "
0,"We examine the relationship between perceived discrimination and physical and emotional health using a national longitudinal survey of the elderly born in 1953 and earlier.  We ask two major research questions:  We ask three major research questions: (1) What factors predict experience of discrimination among the elderly? (2) How does experience of discrimination affect physical and emotional health over a two-year period among the elderly? And (3) Do everyday discrimination and major discriminatory events have similar effects on health and well-being?  Our results are generally consistent with previous research.  It shows that experience of discrimination is socially determined, and is affected by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.  Blacks, other races, and people with lower wealth are more likely to experience discrimination.  Also consistent with previous research, we find a negative association between perceived discrimination and changes in health over a two-year period, and that everyday discrimination has stronger effects on health, especially on emotional health, than major discriminatory events.  These findings suggest that efforts to eliminate discrimination could have the potential to improve health and well-being of the elderly."
0,"This study tackles the question to what extent the composition of protest events is determined by the stance of governments. Established contextual theories do not formulate propositions on how context affects individual protesters. The article engages in empirically testing whether the macro-context affects the internal diversity of the crowds that took to the streets on Feb. 15 2003, the massive day of protest against the upcoming war or; Iraq. Drawing on a survey of 6,753 individual demonstrators in eight countries, we find that the composition of the marches is determined by the stance of the government and the opposition in the countries at stake. Apart from government stance, also the support in public opinion and the type of mobilization (media support) matter for internal diversity."
0,"This work provides an overview of a sociological methodology specifically designed to increase empirical understanding of the social organization of the WorldWideWeb.  Applying a network analytical approach to conceptualization, this methodology treats individual websites as well as hypertextual relationships between websites as units of analysis.  A modified snowball sampling technique, constrained by the delineation of  scope requirements, provides researchers with systematic access to manageable social networks of websites.  Quantitative analyses using network-specific statistical software provide descriptions of network structure; these statistical descriptions then condition qualitative content/discourse analyses of websites.  This method is well suited to the study of social movements, as social movement organizations have taken great advantage of the Internet for purposes of recruitment, mobilization, and framing.  Analyses are underway concerning a network of 89 websites hosted by social movement organizations; preliminary results will be used for heuristic purposes in the presentation."
0,"Past studies have shown debilitating effects of labeling on those who are perceived  or stigmatized  as mentally ill.  This paper takes on the perspective of such labeling theory yet wants to know if such thoroughly negative labeling of the mentally ill is warranted.  Might not there be any positive characteristic associated with mental illness?  The basic assumption of this study is that associating the mentally ill to more positive stereotypical image would reduce stigma-induced problems suffered by those who are labeled as such.  Using data from US 2002 General Social Survey (N=793), the linear association between mental health and empathy is examined.  Past studies have shown mixed results regarding the relationship between various conditions of mental illness and empathy.  This study, for the first time, uses the self-reported measures of mental health and empathy.  The multivariate OLS regression of empathy on self-reported mental health is conducted, controlling for socio-demographic and socialization factors, including gender and age.  The results indicate that there is a positive relationship between the respondent's self-reported poor mental health and his or her empathetic feelings."
0,"Concerns about decreasing response rates have led to many nonresponse studies. Unfortunately, usually only a limited amount of data is available on nonrespondents. Linking administrative data makes information available on all the sampled units including nonrespondents. Statistics Netherlands has constructed a database in which several administrative records and several surveys are connected. In this explorative study we use this dataset to look for homogenous groups of respondents and nonrespondents in survey research using latent class cluster analysis. Latent class techniques can provide insight into the problem of selective nonresponse and currently under-represented societal groups. We identify four different latent classes in a recent Dutch survey and replicate the findings for the same survey conducted 4 years later. Two of the types of sampled units have above-average response rates and the other two have below-average response rates. We also evaluate various latent class models with other response outcomes to gain insight into the contact and cooperation process. "
0,"Using data from Waves 1 and 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this paper compares differences in young people’s (N = 12,305) high school completion, college enrollment, and college graduation across types of family structure.  With a specific focus on multigenerational households, this study draws upon family structure histories to identify adolescents who were living with two biological parents, stepfathers, single mothers, single mothers with a co-resident grandparent, and only grandparents.  We also distinguish between divorced and never married single mothers.  The findings suggest that to better understand differences in adolescents’ educational attainment, it is important to differentiate between the effects of family structure and correlated factors.  These correlated factors include socioeconomic resources, parenting quality, identity of the additional adult, and stability of family structure.  The analyses consistently demonstrate that economic disparities are largely responsible for the lower educational attainment of adolescents from non-intact families and, particularly, from single mother households with co-resident grandparents."
0,"This experiment recreates several features of the selection of candidates for junior professional positions. The situation of central interest involves an assessor (either male or female) and a pair consisting of a male and a female applicant with either equivalent or slightly different academic records. We also investigate effects from quality of record (either excellent or poor) and type of decision (namely, choice between applicants, and ratings of competence and suitability). Our hypotheses consider both gender as social status and as social identity, and predict different outcomes depending on decision type. In line with those predictions, findings show that, at both levels of performance, the question about competence elicited effects only from the two applicants' relative academic standing, while the choice and suitability measures show effects from that standing as well as from sex category of applicant and of assessor. Results and their interpretation are presented and discussed in detail. "
0,"Despite the growing interest in union organizing, there has been little effort to systematically describe the organizing landscape in America today. Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non-NLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized. The findings have implications for future research on labor unions and represent an important step toward an empirical understanding of processes of institutionalization within social movements generally."
0,"This research concerns nursing home rituals involving bureaucracy and physical neglect. It uses 40 ethnographies, biographies, and autobiographies to explore various symbolic themes expressed through everyday interaction in nursing homes. The themes involve bureaucratic concepts such as staff separation, rules, documentation, and efficiency. They also involve ideas of physical neglect, such as medical dereliction, personal negligence, environmental negligence, and bodily harm. Relying on structural ritualization theory, this work argues ritualized symbolic practices of bureaucracy unintentionally manufacture attitudes and acts of mercilessness for workers in both for-profit and nonprofit nursing homes. This aids in the development of rituals facilitating the physical maltreatment of residents."
0,"We formulate and assess thirteen models of how individuals use status differences and expressed claims of ability in task focused groups. The first three models are consistent with an established theory of status characteristics and expectation states, and all of them show good fit with observations. Next we formulate and test ten more models, representing plausible ideas that have appeared in the sociological literature. None of these models does as well at representing the experimental data as the three theoretical models. We use the comparisons to illustrate ideas about the value of theory, the often specious nature of intuition, and the proper uses of behavioral models."
0,"This study uses data from the Child Development Supplement (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to investigate links between family instability and the norms, timing, and quality of adolescents' romantic involvement. The sample included 1,254 adolescents aged 12 -18 years who provided information about their romantic histories. Measures of family instability were compiled from annual reports of household structure and parents' marital status. Results from survival analyses revealed that exposure to family instability was associated with less restrictive rules regarding romantic involvement for adolescents from continuously single parents and those who were exposed to both a marriage and divorce. Adolescents born to married parents who divorced or divorced and remarried were at a greater risk for early dating as were adolescents born to continuously single parents. Regression analyses revealed that adolescents born to single parent families also reported relationships with poorer romantic partners."
0,"The authors employ multiple theories within a political economy framework to examine the structural predictors of the per capita ecological footprints of nations. Engaged theories include ecological modernization, treadmill of production, treadmill of destruction, and ecologically unequal exchange. Results of cross-national panel regression models indicate that the treadmill of production in the context of economic development increases per capita footprints, which contradicts general claims of ecological modernization theory. Similarly, the treadmill of destruction in the mode of military expenditures per soldier positively affects per capita footprints. Those with relatively higher levels of exports sent to economically developed and militarily powerful nations experience suppressed consumption levels, and these effects are especially pronounced and increasingly so for less-developed countries, many of which consume resources well below globally sustainable thresholds. The latter sets of findings support key elements of ecologically unequal exchange theory. Ultimately, this research suggests that a political economy framework that considers domestic attributes and structural relationships in particular contexts is quite useful for understanding the consumption-based environmental harms of nations."
0,"This paper examines reciprocity-based relationships between union leaders and activists in an organizing union local. The study brings to the fore an ongoing exchange of help, linking union assistance with workplace problems to member participation in union campaigns. The analysis focuses on the conditions allowing for this exchange and discusses its implications for organizing success. The conceptual framework borrows from two different traditions on the study of reciprocity, industrial sociologys studies of informal arrangements on the shop floor and anthropological discussions of gift exchange. The paper is based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted from 2000 to 2005, including participant observation of union events and sixty-six in-depth interviews with top union officers, mid-level union leaders, and activists. The findings stress the importance of reciprocity-based relationships for organizing work and highlight the role of feelings of personal indebtedness in members motivations to participate."
0,"In this paper, we propose a new way of understanding red and blue states in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, one that takes into account state-level variation in patterns of family formation.  Using data from the Statistical Abstract, Census, the American Community Survey, and National Vital Statistics Reports, we construct two measures of state patterns of postmodern family formation (a father-absent-family scale, and a small/delayed-family scale).  We find that these patterns of postmodern family formation are powerful predictors of states percentage of votes cast for the Democratic candidate, even after controlling for economic variables and the composition of states populations."
0,"Assessing levels of democracy and the mechanisms that lie behind the emergence and sustenance of these political institutions has produced informative work in the area of political sociology.  Studies of democracy have been surprisingly silent with regards to stratification, specifically regarding gender disparity.  To borrow a term from Reynolds (2002), there appears to be a form of amnesia surrounding issues of gender inequity in the empirical democracy literature.  The lack of inclusion of gender equality as a measure of democracy would seem to be a major problem when theoretical works which point to the troubles of liberal democracy in incorporating women (cf. Okin 1992; Pateman 1989) are considered.  Waylen (1994) suggests that in order to consider gender we must move beyond measuring only institutional political structures to operationalize democracy and reconsider orthodox definitions of civil society and citizenship.  This study attempts to test the usefulness of these suggestions, and determine the degree to which studies of democracy have been harmed by focusing narrowly on political structures.  Specifically, this paper is an exploration of the degree to which studies of democracy and democratization are harmed by not including gender as an important axis in assessing the character of political institutions; gender theorists suggest that gender is a primary organizing principle of the state (Connell 1987; Tickner 2001), and therefore will impact the application of any political structure, including democracy.  Further, the paper will explore how effective democratic states are in extending rights to women, comparing newly developing democracies with established ones."
0,"This article presents a new model of culture in action. Although most sociologists who study culture emphasize its role in post hoc sense making, sociologists of religion and social psychologists tend to focus on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual-process model integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing between ""discursive"" and ""practical"" modes of culture and cognition. The author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of moral judgment, their choice from a list of moral-cultural scripts strongly predicts later behavior."
0,"With reference to the extensively reported gender differences in estimated intelligence, we used a cross-cultural study to investigate whether employment status and education of mothers and fathers (at the time of data collection, in early childhood, and in later childhood) influenced the estimation of parents' general intelligence. Data showed that mothers' as well as fathers' general intelligence was significantly predicted by their education and current employment status. We additionally found a similar relationship between women's (men's) and mothers' (fathers') intelligence compared with the relationship of intelligence ascribed to their fathers (mothers). Furthermore, women's self-estimated intelligence was significantly predicted by their mothers' current employment, whereas men's self-estimated intelligence was predicted by their fathers' education. We furthermore investigated how women's and men's estimations differ between Germany and Spain. Results indicate that the more pronounced gender segregation in Spain was not expressed in larger gender differences in self- or parents' intelligence estimations. "
0,"Previous studies have demonstrated that mentoring provides numerous career benefits to individuals and organizations. This article advances past work by examining the effects of individuals' primary and multiple developmental relationships in a longitudinal study of the careers of lawyers. We develop a social capital perspective on mentorship emphasizing reciprocity of exchange, resource mobilization, and normative expectations embedded within mentoring relationships. We empirically assess mentoring benefits across a diverse range of career rewards. The results provide evidence that male lawyers gain more from their mentor-derived social capital than female lawyers. Specifically, male lawyers with mentors of senior status benefit with elevated earnings, greater perceived fairness in their workplace, and greater work satisfaction. Women with multiple mentors, however, report enhanced work satisfaction. Implications for research on mentoring, social capital, and professional careers are discussed."
0,"India has used both the legislative and judicial systems to advance legal innovations that espouse human rights and social justice.  This paper examines how the higher judiciary has utilized its powers, in particular through public interest litigation, to protect the land rights of Indias vast indigenous population. The inclusion of indigenous land rights as a development issue is especially salient in the Indian case.  With the largest indigenous population in the world, India has often done little to protect the rights of these groups that have worked and lived off of communally shared forest lands for thousands of years.  The Supreme Court of India has touted Public Interest Litigation -- PIL, also sometimes called Social Action Litigation -- as an effective tool for protecting the rights of the disadvantaged, especially indigenous groups. While this litigation is the judicial equivalent of class action suits in the United States, there are important differences.  The Indian Court specifically has focused on the fundamental rights to life and equality. Fundamental rights guaranteed to all Indian citizens include life and equality.  The Supreme Court has interpreted these two rights to include the right to work and live with dignity and liberty.  Procedurally, the Courts practice of PIL has relaxed the rules of standing.  It has effectively allowed persons or groups not personally involved in cases to bring suit on behalf of others, which makes for greater openness of the system."
0,"In this study we examine the social and economic factors driving internal migration flows in Mexico. We pay particular attention to the effect that economic liberalization has had in encouraging migration to border cities. Our analysis of the origin and destination of migrants is carried out at a finer level of geographical detail than ever before. Microdata files from the 2000 population census allow us to distinguish urban- and rural-origin migrants to the largest 115 cities and metropolitan areas in the country. Our results indicate that economic liberalization, measured by the level of foreign investment and employment in the maquiladora export industry, strongly influences migrants' choice of destinations. However, economic liberalization fails to fully account for the attraction of the border, as do the higher emigration rates to the United States from border cities. Our analysis also reveals that migrants to the border region and to cities with high levels of foreign investment are younger, less educated and more likely to be men than migrants to other parts of Mexico. Rural migrants are significantly more likely to move to the border and to cities with high levels of foreign investment than urban migrants. The results of our study have important implication for other countries opening their economies to foreign investment and international trade. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"In this article, I outline what I think sociology can gain from the tools of information visualization and information science programs.  The disciplines of information science, computer science, and statistics are not only infringing on the historic questions of sociology, but also appearing to do it in a more skillful way and sharing these results with a wider audience; information sciences and some computer sciences and statisticians - especially in the area of visualization - do not publish in long-form journals, but rather in conference presentations, providing easier access to non-academics.  Moreover, what journals that are published are done so in digital formats, making them more amenable to images, movies and other media, again benefiting a wider audience.  I outline both theoretical, methodological, and aesthetic approaches all with an aim at gaining a wider audience for sociology."
0,"Through an historical case study, this article addresses how and why physicians carry radical logics into medicine. The radical logic of focus is psychopathology. Obstetrics and gynecology was one of the very first specialties outside of psychiatry to incorporate this logic into its work culture. Employing a core-skill conflict perspective, this article shows that obstetricians and gynecologists' failure to ""deliver the goods"" promised in their core-skill definition invited aggressive responses by general surgeons against their turf claims. Obstetricians and gynecologists embraced psychopathology in the early post-World War II period (1945 through the 1960s) to improve their diagnostic and surgical outcomes in the hope that this would drive surgeons away from their markets. Because of this market promise, obstetricians and gynecologists agreed to serve in a subordinate, screening role in their relationship with psychiatrists. The study illustrates the impact of both negotiated and conflictual interspecialty relations on the programs physicians use to carry radical logics into medicine."
0,"The current sociological literature has only recently begun to reconsider the role of ideas, ideology, cultural signs and symbols in influencing the timing and content of social welfare policies. Little is currently known about the specific processes through which political actors ideas and ideologies interact with their material interests to affect political action and public policy. While recent scholarship has revived the notion that ideas matter in policy-making, more attention needs to be paid to systematically unpacking this relationship. In his review of the literature on the role of ideas in politics and public policy, Campbell (2002) contends that most accounts of policymaking leave largely unexplained exactly how ideas and ideology influence and constrain political actors behavior and decision-making. This paper will seek to help fill this gap in the literature by examining the role the Russell Sage Foundation (RSF) played in crafting and advocating for consumer loan legislation in the early twentieth century. Because the political success of the Foundation depended on its ability to present its recommendations as scientific, neutral and not based on self interest, it provides an excellent case for examining how ideas and ideology, rather than simply material interests, inspire political action and influence social welfare policy making. This paper will also explore how ideas and ideologies change as their advocates are confronted with competing interests, institutional constraints, and new knowledge."
0,"Recent literature has shown that racial minorities, especially racial tokens, in religious organizations bear the highest costs of memberships and are typically less embedded than those of the majority race.  This study builds on this literature by combing critical race, organizational ecology, and rational choices theories in order to explain how the assimilation process of tokens into predominately white congregations varies by race.  Using multi-level data from a nationally representative sample, this study reveals that the token experience differs on account of one’s racial status in the broader society.  Devoting specific attention to America’s three largest minority groups: blacks, Hispanics and Asians, I find that Asians are closest to whites with regards to obtaining the social benefits of religious organizations, while blacks and Hispanics are the farthest from the whites. Consequently, the societal placement of Asians grants them the ability to free-ride in white congregations, while the racial position of blacks and Hispanics requires them to work harder in order to gain access to the social benefits of their congregation."
0,"Recent studies studies that gender may be less influential on the experience of emotion than originally believed. Most of these studies, however, have focused almost exclusively on gender differences in discrete emotional experiences, paying less attention to the ways in which emotions may co-occur within a relatively short period. Using the General Survey's 1996 emotions module, I examine the cot-relational structure of nine latent emotion factors - tranquility, joy, hope, pride, self-reproach, anger, rage, fear and distress - by gender. Using the technique of shortest path analysis, I find women's most common emotional pathways are longer, more complex, and more likely to use more positive and less powerful emotions titan those most common to men. Implications for emotion management, both personal at id interpersonal, are discussed."
0,"In contemporary Western society, individuals are encouraged to adopt a ""duty to be well ideology"" by assuming personal responsibility for health through engagement in self-care practices. We explored the duty to be well within the contexts of pregnancy, first-time parenthood, and marriage. Analyses were informed by Foucault's work on surveillance. In-depth interviews were conducted during the 7th or 8th month of pregnancy with 14 married couples expecting their first child. The sample was recruited from two U.S. university towns. Participants conceptualized the duty to be well as the expectant mother's unyielding bodily obligation to her unborn child and the notion that she should engage in bodily routines to shape fetal development. Both wives and husbands participated in the duty to be well, which included three dimensions: the need to feed, the need to take physical care/stay out of harm's way, and the need to thwart maternal anxiety. However, findings indicated that efforts to safeguard unborn children were sometimes a slippery slope, representing an uneven path and/or inciting ambivalence. Further, participants experienced surveillance associated with the duty to be well as both caring and controlling, depending upon the context of the surveillance and the perceived meaning of the monitoring."
0,"This article examines the contexts in which global civil society can help mitigate energy sector carbon dioxide emissions in fourteen lower income countries.  Structures of global civil society, such as international non-governmental and international environmental treaty regimes, have been theorized to have a wide range of decoupled and ameliorating effects on the natural environment.  Recent empirical studies that lend support to this argument typically have done so by expanding upon the well established STIRPAT identity, which tests for impacts of population, affluence and technology.  However, even though these revised models specify some form of a global civil society variable, they still employ standard regression techniques that test for linear additive effects of independent variables on a dependent variable.  This analysis contends that context matters.  The penetration of global civil society at the national level should have different outcomes depending on the presence or absence of other key conditions such as external indebtedness, level of foreign direct investment and level of democracy.  The analysis of these causal conditions via fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) focuses on how they operate contextually, and lends support to the hypothesis that global civil society alone is not a necessary or sufficient condition for the outcome of emissions mitigation.  The results also show causal heterogeneity, or, the existence of different pathways to the same outcome."
0,This paper will focus specifically on the incidence and prevalence of three bacterial STIs and their resultant impacts on the HIV/AIDS crisis in China.  Chinese adults aged 20-64 will be analyzed as part of the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey.   Research questions will include whether or not older ages and utilization of commercial sex are directly related to incidence of STI transmission as well as whether or not a hidden epidemic exists in China.  The paper will encompass an analysis of adults in China including their self-reported responses and urine results.  Logistic Regression is employed in order to model the results.
0,"The focus of this paper concerns the extent to which college study-abroad programs, particularly the short-term summer programs, have become not only a vehicle for personal development and self-realization but also an opportunity for consumption.  Although consumption is an almost certain byproduct of travel, personal growth is a more problematic outcome. Tourists, including college students on study-abroad programs, often lack the skills and temperament that would favor their growth and self-realization.  Drawing both on questionnaires that were administered to students traveling abroad to a variety of locations around the world both prior to and following their trips, and on several years of participant-observation experience with study-abroad programs, I inquired into the motives for travel and the experiences that students had while studying abroad.   The findings demonstrated a significant difference in the meaning of their travel between students studying in Europe and New Zealand and those who traveled to less developed parts of the world.  The key difference between the two groups is the far greater opportunities for consumption that students in Europe confront compared with those in Africa and Latin America.  Study abroad in European locales is, in effect, a vehicle for the consumption of travel."
0,Despite the theoretical emphasis on religious decline in modern societies sociologists remain divided over trends in religious activity and belief that support or refute claims of religious decline Much of this disagreement stems from the inability to distinguish between period and cohort effects when analyzing repeated cross-sectional survey data I use the intrinsic estimator a recently developed method of simultaneously estimating age period and cohort effects to examine changes in Americans religious service attendance prayer belief in the afterlife and biblical literalism Results show that regular service attendance declines predominantly across cohorts There are also period- and cohort-based declines in biblical literalism and a cohort-based decline in prayer Belief in the afterlife is relatively stable across periods and cohorts These results provide mixed support for theories of religious decline and they demonstrate the importance of differentiating between period and cohort effects on social change 
0,"Working from the formal model of  population growth, Pt = P0ert, we use population change in the U.S. Great Plains between 1900 and 1930 to demonstrate the efficiency of an alternative approach to estimating population change, r: growth curve modeling (GCM).  Through this method, the researcher treats processes of change as a trajectory rather than a series of panels, resulting in a more efficacious and parsimonious analysis.  Three general aspects of population growth can be addressed through linear and non-linear GCM techniques, namely (1) establishing a mean growth rate that represents the general pattern of change across all units, (2) estimating the degree of local level variation around the average rate, and (3) analyzing the relative contribution of factors influencing this variation.  Our findings reveal that the non-linear model is more appropriate for the early years of development on the Great Plains, indicating that the rate of population change varied over the period with rapid growth at the outset followed by a decreasing rate of growth during the later portion.  In addition, we observed considerable variation around the average growth rate, and attribute much of this to county settlement date, urban proximity, and economic base."
0,"A large body of social science literature has focused on the factors that influence sentencing outcomes within the federal court system A neglected variable in this line of research is the citizenship status of the offender Using the United States Sentencing Commission s Monitoring of Federal Criminal Sentences data from 2006 the present study examines the effect of citizenship status on the likelihood of incarceration and the length of the prison sentence This study extends previous research in three ways first by examining citizenship status using post-Booker data second exploring the differences between citizens, legal aliens and illegal aliens rather than comparing all non-citizens to US citizens and third examining all offenses rather than only drug offenses Most importantly, this study partitions the data by citizenship status to determine if the effects of race/ethnicity and other variables (e g. type of offense and level of education) vary by citizenship status The results demonstrate that both legal and illegal aliens have a higher probability of incarceration than similarly-situated US citizens but that the sentences imposed on illegal aliens are shorter than those imposed on citizens However different results emerged when the data were partitioned by citizenship status Judges imposed shorter prison sentences on Latino citizens but longer prison sentences on Latino illegal aliens These results are discussed in relation to theoretical explanations and policy implications "
0,"A growing body of research demonstrates powerful effects of international organizations on national policy, and the literature on international conflict is increasingly adopting a network perspective on international organizations, but we still know little about the network structure of the world polity itself. This is surprising in light of the theoretical implications of world polity theory, world systems theory, and the world civilizations approach to the structure of the world polity. Using data on a set of prominent intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), along with a comparison to the complete population of IGOs, this study examines the world polity as a network structured by symbolic and material conflict. Network analysis reveals a contradictory duality in the structure of the world polity: while states are densely interconnected through international organizations, these international organizations are only sparsely interconnected. Contrary to world polity theory, world system position and world civilization predict position in the world polity. These results show that, in neglecting the network structure of the world polity, previous research has underestimated the extent of structural inequality in the world polity. Because embeddedness in the world polity has such powerful effects on state policies, international trade, and international conflict, the centralization and fragmentation of the world polity may have disintegrative implications for world politics."
0,"Education has long been recognized as an institution that plays a prominent role in the reproduction of social class. Children from socially advantaged backgrounds tend to achieve higher educational outcomes than children from more disadvantaged backgrounds. In this study, data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were utilized to better understand the relationship between social advantage, high school educational achievements, adolescent behaviors, and educational attainment. It was found that individuals from socially advantaged backgrounds had greater high school educational achievements and were less likely to engage in problematic adolescent behaviors, and that these behaviors were, in fact, related to educational attainment. The socially advantaged did have greater levels of educational attainment. Most significantly, it was apparent that the socially advantaged were more likely to overcome low high school educational achievements and problematic adolescent behaviors to achieve higher levels of post-high school educational attainment. The implications of these findings are discussed."
0,"After 25 years of intense scrutiny, social capital remains an important yet highly debated concept in social science research. This research uses data from youth and mentors in several chapters of Big Brothers/Big Sisters to assess the importance of different mentoring relationship characteristics in creating positive outcomes among youths. The literature on social capital suggests that key characteristics are: (1. the amount of time spent between individuals, (2. racial similarity, (3. level of trust, (4. social class difference, and (5. intergenerational closure. I examine the effects of these social capital measures on academic and deviant behavioral outcomes and run models using propensity score weights to address selection bias. The results indicate that both the amount of time spent in a relationship and the level of trust consistently have positive effects for youths. Counter to what some theory suggests, race-matching and closure between parent and mentor have limited effects, and social class difference between individuals has no significant effect on any of the examined outcomes. These findings have important implications for future work on social capital and adolescent relationships in general."

0,"This paper argues that notwithstanding the pejorative connotation of the term dual unionism, competition between independent labor federations serves to spur innovation and revitalization in union organizing among member unions.  We analyze the impact of dual unionism over the last century by estimating changes in overall union density (and AFL density) during periods when major dual union federations existed and periods when they did not.  We also measure the impact of changes in the number and density of independent unions, which have maintained a steady presence throughout the last century.  We find that when more unions vie for members votes, there is a positive impact on labor union density."
0,"In this study, the effect of age at which immigrants enter the United States on the probability of stealing is examined. Capturing the dynamic element of time in the relationship between youth immigration and criminal behavior is an important step forward in examining the immigration-crime nexus. Panel data in the NLSY97 provide an excellent opportunity to study the dynamic effect of time in examining the longitudinal relationship between immigration and criminal behavior. After controlling for structural and demographic predictors of crime, the findings indicate that immigrants do steal less than non-immigrants, however they do steal more with acculturation. The earlier immigrants enter the United States, the higher likelihood they have of engaging in stealing. This highlights the need to ensure adequate educational and structural opportunities are available for immigrant populations as they settle and naturalize in the United States, and come to share the same sense of the American dream as native-born Americans."
0,"Understanding how schoolsa key context for childrenshape students' cultural trajectories is important since these trajectories are tied to youth development and achievement. This study assessed how the size of the school's group of acculturated Latino and non-Latino students influenced the acculturation of 1,720 Latino 5th-grade students from urban public schools in the Southwest United States. A longitudinal secondary data analysis revealed that controlling for wave 1 acculturation, youths in schools with larger proportions of linguistically acculturated students were more acculturated at wave 2 than youths in schools with smaller proportions of such students. This effect was independent of Latino students' baseline acculturation level and was found even in schools with minority proportions of more acculturated students."
0,"In this address, I review available published presidential addresses written by presidents of various sociological organizations as a way of thinking about sociology and what sociologists may find important. Using Eller's categorizations, I divide the articles into three types including (1) query of the profession in which the author discussed the history of sociology or its future; (2) a call for new directions in methodologies or theories within sociology; and (3) a focus on the author/president's research. Then, I focus on what is missing in most presidential addresses given by sociologists: sociologists' role as educators and the impact we have upon students. I find that most presidential addresses do not include any or only passing nods to our responsibilities as teachers. I end the address with a call to consider our responsibilities and impact as teachers."
0,"Traditional approaches of the past have tended to focus on marginalized groups, and on one dimension of inequality at a time (race or gender or class, etc.). These approaches are limited in many ways. I will present an alternative theoretical/pedagogical framework, arguing that we should incorporate the concept of privilege into our classes, and teach about privilege and oppression from an intersectional perspective. This approach not only captures more recent theorizing around race and ethnicity, but also strategically pre-empts student resistance."
0,"Literacy is associated with many outcomes of research interest as well as with respondents' ability to even participate in surveys, yet very few surveys attempt to measure it because doing so is often complex, requiring extensive tests. The central goal of this paper is to develop a parsimonious measure of respondents' reading ability that does not require a complex literacy test. We use data from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy to identify correlates of reading ability to form a literacy index. These correlates include self-assessments of one's ability to understand, read and write English, and literacy practices at home. Our literacy index reliably discerns literacy test scores above educational attainment, and the index shows high internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.78) and validity. The paper concludes with implications of these findings for survey research practitioners and suggestions for future research. "
0,"This article draws on the extensive literature on economic and social mobility in America to examine intergenerational contextual mobility, defined as the degree to which inequalities in neighborhood environments persist across generations. PSID data are analyzed to reveal remarkable continuity in neighborhood economic status from one generation to the next. The primary consequence of persistent neighborhood stratification is that the racial inequality in America's neighborhoods that existed a generation ago has been transmitted, for the most part unchanged, to the current generation. More than 70% of black children who grow up in the poorest quarter of American neighborhoods remain in the poorest quarter of neighborhoods as adults, compared to 40% of whites. The results suggest that racial inequality in neighborhood economic status is substantially underestimated with short-term measures of neighborhood income or poverty and, second, that the steps taken to end racial discrimination in the housing and lending markets have not enabled black Americans to advance out of America's poorest neighborhoods."
0,"Aker's (1998) theory of social structure and social learning (SSSL) argues that structural variations in deviant behavior, such as gender or race/ethnic differences in underage or heavy drinking, are mediated by social learning variables. However, longitudinal analyses of deviant drinking in an urban sample of white, black, and Hispanic adolescents fail to support the SSSL mediation hypothesis. Significant gender and race/ethnic differences persist after controls for social learning variables as well as for social bonding variables. Interaction effects involving two social bonding variables-family attachment and moral belief-point to theoretically important conditions that maintain a gender gap in underage drinking and relatively low levels of deviant drinking among African American adolescents."
0,"This paper links individual- and household-level data from the nationally representative Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with neighborhood-level environmental hazard data derived from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) in order to determine whether regional differences in environmental inequality exist at the household level.  The data cover nearly every metropolitan area in the contiguous U.S. from 1990-2005, we divide the contiguous U.S. into nine regions, and we use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to weight the potential impact of each TRI facility inversely according to geographic distance.  Results indicate that the existence and magnitude of environmental racial inequality, as well as the role that race, income and other household characteristics play in shaping this inequality, vary in important ways across the nine regions of the country.  This has important implications for environmental inequality and public health research."
0,"Using data obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this research analyzes the job placement across employment sectors of young Chinese workers (age 17 to 24) in the second decade of the market-oriented economic reform, focusing on how an individuals labor market outcome is related to the presence of his or her family members in each employment sector. Specifically, this research attempts to distinct the effects of family strategy to diversify risks and the effects of family social capital. Moreover, the period effects of family characteristics on individuals' employment sectors over time as the market-oriented reform develops are also examined in the research. Major findings include (1) the sorting of young workers into different employment sectors is determined by family social capital in each sector, rather than by the family strategy to diversify the risks during an era full of uncertainty; (2) the family social capital of employment sector are transferable within the off-farm sectors, but not between the off-farm and farming sectors; (3) there is no significant decline of the effects of family social capital, and the value of social capital in the private sector actually increases over time."
0,"This paper isolates some factors that predict legal consciousness in order to aid in the development of policies conducive to an increased utilization of the law at all stages of the migration process.  For example, if individuals with greater knowledge of U.S. immigration law express a greater willingness to use the law, then such findings could indicate support for programs tailored to provide legal education to potential migrants.  By gaining a greater understanding of the manner in which knowledge of the law and legal experiences affect migration and legalization decisions, laws and policies can be designed that will encourage legalized entry into the United States and legalization of the undocumented population."
0,"Second generation Palestinian-Americans like many other immigrants face the dilemma of a possessing a dual allegiance to their parents' country of origin and their own place of birth. However, unlike most other immigrants this relationship is often-times contentious and not easily resolvable. Based on ethnographic research begun in 2001, this paper argues that Palestinian-Americans use the discourse of citizenship to overcome this hurdle. They use citizenship to differentiate between being Palestinian and American without renouncing their claims to either identity."
0,"Despite the shared social location and situation of all illicit retail drug markets as illegal commercial enterprises, research has demonstrated that they are not all alike. For this presentation we compare and describe the organizational and operational characteristics of local methamphetamine markets through a survey of 1,367 local law enforcement agencies and follow-up telephone interviews with approximately 60 of these agencies representing communities with different types of local meth markets in the United States. Similar to findings of earlier research on methamphetamine markets in the U.S., we found that in general in meth markets in the United States the product is likely to be sold through personal relationships rather than openly in public spaces. Those cities and counties that are supplied with methamphetamine almost exclusively through local labs, or what might be called home grown production, arguably are more autonomous in that they are less dependent on outsiders for their product. In those places where the local meth is more likely imported, particularly from Mexico, the local market is inevitably dependent on some level of relationship with outsiders who are not part of the local community and markets are more structured."
0,"Recent research suggests that racial residential segregation may be detrimental to health. This study investigates the influence of neighborhood racial isolation on obesity and considers the role Of neighborhood disorder as a mediator in this relationship. For the city of Philadelphia, we find that residence in a neighborhood with high black racial isolation is associated with a higher body mass index and higher odds of obesity among women, but not men, highlighting important sex differences in the influence of neighborhood structure on health. Furthermore, the influence of high racial isolation on women weight status is mediated, in part, by the physically disordered nature of such neighborhoods. Disorder of a more social nature (as measured by incident crime) is not associated with weight status."
0,"In my multi-year race relations study in the city of Long Beach, California, I was particularly intrigued with how diverse racial / ethnic communities can sometimes find best practices of collaboration. The historical dimension for the study referenced a year long application for $100 million dollars that would have been the defining capstone for an inter-racial civic planned urban renewal process (the Empowerment Zone Application / EZA). For this panel, I have selected particular methodological aspects of the research that may be of interest on both shear empirical and more philosophic design levels. Holding some notion of a ‘reflexive researcher’ in mind, several different types of data modeling approaches will be briefly discussed in this discussion, focusing upon one case example from my research (Asian Americans / -- in the main Cambodian Americans). I place particular emphases on the art of the arbitrary for interpretive work in the quantifying aspects of the research. Though I have enclosed a somewhat lengthy paper for review, for the presentation, I distil main themes accordingly."
0,"We examine the success of California's black, Latino, and Asian voters in ballot proposition elections, showing that minority voters lose more often than whites across all ballot propositions, and that this disadvantage is not limited to a small subset of racially-targeted propositions. Minority voters are 2-5 percentage points less likely than otherwise-similar white voters to be on the winning side of ballot propositions. These differences persist after excluding racially-targeted propositions because minority voters are more likely to lose on several issues including elections, the environment, health, housing, taxes, and transportation. We demonstrate that race is more important than class in describing which voters lose. "
0,"The early life-course origins of inequality are well-recognized by both highly visible scholars and policymakers, given the existence of social programs such as Head Start.  More specifically, early childhood health is a topic of serious research on its role in the production of durable intra- and intergenerational socioeconomic inequality.  Despite research and policy attention, however, our understanding of the dynamics of health and social inequality over the early life cycle remains elementary in several ways.  Guided by cumulative disadvantage theory, I use nationally representative, longitudinal data from the British National Child Development Study to examine the changing relationship between child health and skill development within a rigid educational context.  I consider child health as not only an early source of skill inequality, but also a potential source of changing skill inequality, as well as a variable source of inequality in itself.  The findings suggest that the prenatal and infant health environment is related to growing skill inequalities throughout the schooling process.  In contrast, the influence of early school-age health weakens with age.  Finally, declines in health are strongly related to declines in children’s relative skill, suggesting that compounding health inequalities may serve to multiply the otherwise short-term influence of a short-lived, age-specific illness.  These findings are robust to a number of supplementary sensitivity tests of robustness.  Overall, the analysis raises questions about biological vs. structural pathways linking child health and skill development, and suggests that health disadvantage and skill disparities co-evolve."
0,"An increasing amount of research has been dedicated to studying various society-environment relations. Although much research exists that studies the impact of economic development on environmental degradation, there is a paucity of sociological literature that examines the impact that the natural environment has on community-level economic development activities. Using survey data collected from 101 communities in Oregon and Washington, the author examines the relationship of natural capital on the pursuit and implementation of two types of economic development: industrial recruitment and self-development. Results suggest that the pursuit and implementation of economic development are related to several components of natural capital. However, natural capital affects industrial recruitment and self-development in opposite ways, particularly when implementing these two strategies. Moreover, it shows that while the natural surroundings of communities affect the pursuit of economic development, the impact becomes more important for the implementation of economic development strategies, net of other social and demographic factors. These findings illustrate the need for researchers, policymakers, and community activists to heavily consider the role that the natural environment plays when looking at social phenomena such as economic development."
0,"Prices for fine Art rely on a community of professional appraisers to act as an epistemic community that facilitates the making of prices for art. Although the assumption of market prices being an inherent signal of exchange value, I draw on interviews with appraisers and auction specialists to show that market exchange itself relies on auction estimates to frame ""appropriate"" prices. Rather than being produced solely via market exchange, prices for Art are produced by both markets and authorizations. Authorizations come in the form of acceptance by official designates of the State (the IRS) or insurance companies. Appraisers play a key role in reducing informational ambiguity to make both kinds of these prices knowable, and thus to make Art commensurable."
0,"Richard Easterlin asserts that individuals born into cohorts relatively larger than  those from preceding generations experience poorer health, social and economic well being. While there has been extensive testing of this hypothesis on a variety of outcomes, measuring the effects of relative cohort size on academic performance, particularly at the elementary and post secondary levels, has been largely neglected. In contrast, there has been a wealth of research on absolute cohort size, typically measured as a student's school or class size. Although measures of absolute cohort size merit considerable empirical and policy focus, relative cohort size should not be ignored since resource allotment throughout the schooling hierarchy is largely a function of historical enrollment patterns. Using an age-period-cohort-characteristics model, I identify the effects of relative cohort size on dropout rates and academic achievement at national and sub national levels. Since we may be concerned with biased estimates due to selection, I use a method introduced by Hoxby (2000) to exploit random variation in student enrollment due to random variation in births from year to year. The estimates indicate that relative cohort size has no effect on dropout rates at the national level. At the subnational level, specifically at the district level in California, I find no effects on dropout rates or standardized reading and math test scores."
0,"Young people are known to be among the least politically engaged members of society, with explanations for this disengagement ranging from feelings of inefficacy to lacking a stake in communities.  The 2008 Presidential Election, and particularly the campaign of Barack Obama, was thought to energize a group with notoriously little interest in politics and low rates of electoral participation.  This study, based upon data collected at a small, Catholic New England college in the two weeks prior to the 2008 election, seeks to better understand what factors determine whether individuals intend to vote, and if so, what factors influence for whom they vote.  Findings indicate that being female, feeling that the outcome of the election will personally affect him or her, and feeling that his or her vote matters are all positive predictors of whether one reports intending to vote.  Feeling that the outcome of the election matters personally also increases the likelihood an individual supports Obama.  Those with more faith in the U.S. political system and higher levels of religiosity are more likely to support McCain.  Finally, supporting the policy proposals of each of the candidates does translate into support for the respective candidate, but is not the dominant predictor."
0,"The framing activities of African-American predecessors of King enabled the Gandhian repertoire's transnational diffusion from a Southern to a Northern social movement. To explore the framing-transnational diffusion nexus, this paper starts with a brief review of existing social movement theories. Then it discusses three specific moments of interaction between African-American intellectuals and Gandhians in India, and their effects on African-American frames and applications of the Gandhian repertoire in the United States. The final section considers the theoretical relevance of my empirical findings."
0,"In explanations offered for fear of crime, two different paradigms can be distinguished. The first considers fear of crime as a rational reaction to crime and victimization; the other views such fear as a representation of more general feelings of malaise. The paradigms suggest different research strategies and offer different explanations for the same empirical observations. The choice of paradigm therefore determines the meaning of the empirical findings and hence the policy implications that can be drawn from them. In this article, the authors describe the paradigms, illustrate the way in which they offer different explanations for the same observations, and try to empirically discriminate between them on the basis of crucial tests. The tests are performed on data for the Flemish ( Belgian) population aged nineteen to thirty-six. The results support the view that fear of crime or feelings of insecurity should be seen mainly as a consequence of, on one hand, general feelings of malaise, vulnerability, and helplessness that can have many origins and, on the other hand, exposure to processes of communication that highlight crime and the risk of victimization."
0,"Based on ethnographic research of the lives of Japanese expatriate mothers and children in Los Angeles, this study uncovers a way of being transnational that has not been studied fully in the literatures on assimilation and transnationalism. Deeply concerned about the childrens reintegration into Japans competitive educational system, the mothers and children develop mental transnationalism, which I define as imagining, planning, and strategizing a return home trajectory based on bicultural knowledge. This study examines how the mothers maintain and enact mental transnationalism to facilitate their childrens acquisition of bilingual and bicultural skills that are beneficial to both their adaptation to the present American educational context and the Japanese educational context to which they return in the future. It finds that embeddedness in a resourceful transnational social field, part of which is composed of institutionalized preparation rituals during the pre-departure period and a well-established Japanese community in Los Angeles are the crucial factors sustaining mental transnationalism. It also finds that child-rearing based on mental transnationalism requires mothers intensive labor, which contributes to childrens successful return home yet takes its toll on mothers emotion."
0,"Qualitative and quantitative research has Suggested that married couples handle the increasing demands of intensive parenting norms and work expectations by reducing spousal time (e.g., the time that spouses spend alone with each other). Using nationally representative time-diary data, this study examined whether married individuals with children at home lost more spousal time in the years 1975-2003 than individuals without children at home. The analyses showed that on average married individuals have reduced their spousal time by 50 minutes a day. Contrary to expectations, however, individuals with minor children at home had lower time declines than individuals without children. The strategies that assisted married individuals with children to protect their Spousal time differed between weekdays and weekend days."
0,"By adopting a post-structuralist perspective I consider the democratic State both as an arena in which tensions from the society are manifested and negotiated and as an agent that has the potentiality of changing the social structure, and therefore gender relations, through the use of force.  The approval of family violence legislation and the design of public policies constitute attempts on behalf of the state for promoting changes in the social structure.  The in-deep examination of the processes through which the State promotes measures to combat violence against women and the context in which these processes take place is of theoretical relevance.  This paper considers that the socioeconomic, political and historic context is of central relevance for understanding how womens rights are defined and what type of protection is granted.  The approval of family violence legislation in Mexico has responded more to an attempt to gain legitimacy than to a real interest about the problem."
0,"This paper evaluates the impact of indebtedness on pro-social behavior. Specifically, I examine differences in pro-social behavior by the instance of indebtedness. I then evaluate how both the amount and type of debt an individual carries influences his or her involvement in voluntary organizations and their political participation. To test the assumption that presence, amount, and type of debt impact pro-social behavior, I use the 2006 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. I use Ordinary Least Squares regression techniques to find that debt holding does significantly influence the likelihood that individuals will join voluntary organizations or be politically active. Consumer debt decreases the number of voluntary organizations that an individual belongs to and decreases their political involvement both through the presence of debt and by the amount of debt an individual carries. Carrying investment debt, however, has an inconsistent negative relationship with pro-social behavior. The amount of investment debt an individual carries actually increases their pro-social behavior and can negate the overall negative impact of debt holding. I show that consumer debt works to disengage individuals from civic responsibility while investment debt works to engage individuals in civic responsibility. Understanding how different forms of credit impact social processes, I argue, will strengthen our overall understanding of how growing credit use will impact stratification in American society."
0,"This paper analyzes ethnographic data from an ongoing study of racial tensions in progressive social movements.  We consider the involvement of politically progressive, middle class whites in two such movements.  The first is a political movement known as pro Black abolitionism that is opposed to the death penalty and committed to freeing political prisoners.  The second is a cultural movement known as pro Black or conscious hip hop that promotes a critical politics of race and Afrocentric cultural sensibilities.  We discover the persistence of racial exceptionalism and color blind ideologies among white participants despite their literacy in race conscious discourse.  We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for understanding the racial structure of interaction orders."
0,"This study examines narratives on the meaning of addiction recovery through interviews with 45 methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients. Results show that heroin addicts are dealing with multiple recoveries and many are simultaneous to each other: recoveries concerning (1) addiction, (2) associational disruptions, (3) self-identity and actualization, (4) drug induced diseases (HIV/AIDS, HCV, etc.), and (5) catalyzing event(s). The research findings, anathema of clinical MMT views on recovery, suggest that drug addicted individuals might benefit from interventions that address their multiple recovery issues as opposed to ones that emphasize recovery strictly in sobriety terms."
0,"Environmental issues continue to grow in international prominence, as environmental conditions are recognized as some of the most important problems facing the world. Research examining this globalization of environmental concern shown in public opinion surveys emphasizes the importance of context yet is currently underspecified. To address this gap, this research uses a multi-level, cross-national study to examine individual-level and country-level influences on three measures of environmental concern: environmental threat awareness, environmental efficacy, and willingness to pay. At the individual level, education, age, and gender affect environmental concerns. At the national level, economic, political, and environmental factors affect environmental concerns. Importantly, contextual factors differ in their effects depending on the dimension of environmental concern measured. Results from cross-level interactions for education confirm these complexities across these measures, supporting a dimensionality argument. The importance of the measurement of environmental concern shown in this research is emphasized for future cross-national scholarship. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"In this paper we test whether oral language development during the preschool years plays a role in explaining the positive relationship between family social class background and childrens school performance.  In particular, we test for the portion of the social class effect on 2nd  4th grade reading, mathematics, and overall performance that is explained by oral language skills when the student enters kindergarten.  We do so using a unique data set containing unusually comprehensive measures of kindergarten oral language skill, as well as a control variable for non-oral language IQ.  Estimation is via a structural equation model with latent variables.  The results show that oral language skill at kindergarten entry explains most of the effect of social class background on elementary school performance."
0,"We outline a new explanation of discrimination against numerical minorities. In contrast to prior work that focuses on how the content of categories affects discrimination, our argument describes how the size of categories leads to discrimination. Specifically, we argue that, when comparing multiple categories, actors tend to view larger categories as more closely approximating an underlying population than smaller ones. As a result, a decision maker will tend to expect that members of a numerical majority are more likely to be what he/she is searching for, whether it is the best or worst candidate. We report the results of two studies designed to test these arguments. To demonstrate the generality of the proposed mechanism, Study 1 tested the argument in a non-social domain. Participants disproportionately favored the majority (vs. minority) category when searching for a single winning lottery ticket, and favored the minority category when the goal was to avoid a single losing ticket. Our second study supported an additional implication of the argument in a social domain: decision makers tended to rank highly qualified majority job candidates as better than equally qualified minority candidates, and relatively unqualified majority candidates as worse than equally unqualified minority candidates.

0,"This study examined the viewpoints and experiences of college students with regard to interracial dating. Thirty-five black students and 35 white students in attendance at a predominantly white university participated in face-to-face interviews. Black men and white women expressed more favorable attitudes toward interracial dating compared with black women and white men. Some white females downplayed the significance of interracial relationships, going so far as to suggest it is a nonissue, apparently unaware that it is an issue of concern to many students, especially black females. The concept of white privilege is discussed as an explanation for white students' perspectives. Students who dated interracially faced social consequences, including negative reactions from peers and family members. Findings reveal that the dating landscape differs for students based on their race and gender. In particular, the dating pool appears to be limited for black females at the institution under study."
0,"Based on more than 14 months' ethnographic research in China, this article brings in culture and symbolic interactionism to understand the social embeddedness of economic transactions. First, an analytic frame linking tie strengths to defining principles, relational properties, and interactions is constructed and applied to changes in life insurance transactions in China. The data suggest that strong tie transactions were common until the economic gains of the sellers were made public. The author argues that the ethical-affective principle that defines strong ties and the high intensity of trust, affection, and asymmetric obligation that constitute these ties make them a double-edged sword for economic transactions. Instead, ties with midrange or weak strength are more effective because of their relational complementarity (although direct economic exchanges may take place among strong ties under extreme institutional or contingency conditions). The author also reveals that dramaturgical interactions, through which economic actors exercise their agency, are an integral part of embedded transactions."
0,"This paper explores and identifies the patterns of dating attitudes and behaviors among second-generation Chinese Americans.  Do they acculturate to American dating culture? Or do they negotiate between Chinese and American dating cultures in a way that is neither Chinese nor American, but a creative balancing culture between the two dating cultures? Further, I examine and explore the implications of gender and racial identities underneath their dating attitudes and behaviors. Social constructionist model of ethnicity and Assimilation theory are applied and tested in this study. Grounded theory is applied to analyze collected data from in-depth interviews with 20 second-generation Chinese Americans in metro- Atlanta area.  In so doing, I uncovered a subtle process by which the second-generation Chinese youths constructed their dating values and identities through both differentiating and integrating their parents and white peers dating cultures and gender norms. Chinese American youths constructed and reconstructed their own dating values, gender norms, and further ethnic identities through various processes of picking and choosing from both cultures.  Hence, Straight-line assimilation theories that assume adaptation into mainstream American culture do not explain the complexity of the dating culture created by the second-generation Chinese American youths.  Furthermore, in response to the constrains from both Chinese family and racism from American society, the second-generation Chinese American youth make every effort to expand the space for individual ethnic options through the process of constructing their own dating values."
0,"This study investigates the effect of the latest wave of economic globalization on manufacturing employment in developing countries. It revisits the classic debate on the effect of internal and external influences on industrialization, and extends this debate to contemporary developing countries. In the process, it assesses the evidence for development/productivity, world systems/dependency and globalization explanations, and uses a comprehensive dataset on 64 developing countries from 1980 through 2003. The results generally show that manufacturing employment increased in most developing countries. First, this study finds that the level of economic development measured by gross domestic product per capita is the most important factor influencing the size of manufacturing employment. Second, economic globalization also influences manufacturing employment in developing countries, but mainly through trade. The size of exports and low-technology exports have a significant positive effect on manufacturing employment in developing countries. Finally, the analysis provides limited support for world systems/dependency theories. Raw materials exports do not significantly influence manufacturing employment while foreign direct investment has a negative impact in some models. This study concludes that the latest wave of economic globalization contributed to the expansion of manufacturing employment in developing countries, although it is not the most significant factor shaping the size of manufacturing employment in these countries."
0,"Fatalism has been recognized by sociologists as a key concept in sociology. Recent debates on fatalism revolve around the way theological fatalism influences the individual and society. Unfortunately, little has been said about the topic in the communist and post-communist world. Using recent data from a national survey of residents in People's Republic of China (P.R. China), this article examines the relationship between fatalistic voluntarism and life happiness in the context of China's Marxist-atheist monopoly. Results show that fatalistic voluntarism has a significant, positive net effect on life happiness among those Chinese who believe in fate control. Implications of this study are discussed."
0,"As climate change has become an increasingly salient topic among policy makers, scientists, politicians, and the public in many nations around the world, various studies in social science have addressed the way this issue is socially constructed. However, an important component of this discourse that often goes underexamined are the social pathways through which possible solutions to climate change, such as renewable energy, are themselves constructed. Considering the contemporary mass print news media’s prodigious ideological influence, and the potential value of renewable energy in addressing climate change, investigating the social construction of renewables in this medium is crucial. This paper will justify the use of semistructured interviews with environmental journalists, and a critically informed qualitative frame analysis of the online content of five of the most ubiquitous newspapers in the United States to address this underdeveloped aspect of the sociology of energy and the environment. Utilizing the literatures of environmental sociology, critical theory, communication, social construction, and policy studies, such a project would describe: the process of making renewable-source electricity (RSE) news in newsrooms, the character of RSE frames as a potentially contested “nature” or “landscape”, and the place of RSE frames in news as discourse supportive of hegemonic interests. This is important because the ubiquitous social reality produced and perpetuated by the mass print news media regarding renewables affects the ways in which many stakeholders envision the feasibility of renewables as a solution to fossil fuel dependence and the problems it, and climate change, present."
0,"Political processes within world-systems are often characterized by cycles or waves.  Because spatial waves of expansion/contraction occur across all types of world-systems, all such pulsations cannot be rooted in a specific mode of production or mode of accumulation. Rather, these cycles are themselves evidence that polities and world systems are dynamical systems with various feedback loops.   Afroeurasia (in conventional terms Asia, Europe, northern Africa) has been linked, at least at the information and luxury goods exchange levels (Chase-Dunn, Manning, and Hall 2000), for two and half millennia or more.  There has been much speculation about what processes drive various cycles within world-systems, what mechanisms may lead to (partial) synchrony between some world-systems separated by great distances, and why there is little or no synchrony between others (Denemark et al. 2000; Frank 1993; Grimes 2000). The current state of the field bears a striking similarity to the debates that occurred among population ecologists a few decades ago.  We argue in this paper that there is much to be learned from what ecologists have found from their studies, analyses, and models of oscillatory population systems. While ecological models and analytical approaches cannot be imported wholesale, or without adjustment, into world-system problems, they do offer a number of useful insights, and suggestions for future research."
0,"Germany has been found to be one of the most secular societies of the industrialized nations and in Europe, but there is more to be studied to better understand the religious phenomenon that does exist.  Similarly, there are distinguishable differences between the social structures and practices of eastern and western Germany, with eastern Germany largely secularized. Only about 25-30 percent of eastern Germans belong to a church, compared to about 75 percent in western Germany.  Using religious values questions from the World Values Survey/European Values Survey, to better define ‘religiosity’, this paper investigates how ‘religious’ those persons are who claim to be members of a church.  We raise the following arguments and questions for investigation:  Defining religiosity by a measurement of attendance and/or membership is inherently flawed and missing key components of determining what people believe and value.  What differences are observed between church members and non-members?  Likewise, what differences exist between eastern and western Germans who are church members?"
0,"This article studies the relationship between household income and housework time across 33 countries. In most countries, low-income individuals do more housework than their high-income counterparts; the differences are even greater for women's domestic work time. The analysis shows that the difference between rich and poor women's housework time falls with economic development and rises with overall economic inequality. I use a cross-national reinterpretation of arguments from the historical time-use literature to show that this is attributable to the association between economic development and the diffusion of household technologies and to the association between economic inequality and the prevalence of service consumption among high-income households. Results for a direct measure of technology diffusion provide striking evidence for the first interpretation. The findings question the widespread notion that domestic technologies have had little or no impact on women's housework time. On a general level, I find that gender inequalities are fundamentally conditioned by economic inequalities. A full understanding of the division of housework requires social scientists to go beyond couple-level dynamics and situate households and individuals within the broader social and economic structure."
0,"In this paper, we use data on pairs of new, unmarried mothers and fathers in twenty U.S. cities to explore differences across racial and ethnic groups in transitions to marriage.  White and Hispanic parents were about 2.5 times more likely to marry than African-American parents in the year following a non-marital birth.  Taking into account group differences in demographic and human capital variables reduces thes African-American marriage gap by 25 percent compared with white parents and by 12 percent compared with Hispanic parents.  Taking into account group differences in the specialization and companionate rationales for marriage further reduces the African-American/white and African-American/Hispanic gap in marriage by 25 percent.  Past research into the racial difference in marriage has tended to focus on the weak position of African-American men in the labor market, and conflict between African-American men and women.  We find that an emphasis on the positive measures of relationship quality included in the ""companionate"" domain explains more of the racial difference in marriage than a focus on measures of conflict.  We conclude that a theoretical framework that incorporates both specialization and companionate rationales for marriage furthers our understanding of the racial difference in marriage."

0,"This article examines how mainstream media frame and represent cosmetic surgery, tattooing, and body piercing as methods of body modification. Through an analysis of seventy-two newspaper articles on cosmetic surgery, tattooing, and body piercing, this article shows how cosmetic surgery and tattooing are positively presented as consumer lifestyle options, while piercing is often negatively framed as an unhealthy and problematic practice. Similarly, findings indicate that risks associated with cosmetic surgery and tattooing are frequently downplayed, as are tattooing's associations with deviance, while the potential risks related to body piercing are overemphasized. Gender is also a prominent framing device, typically as a method of reinforcing normative appearance expectations. This article concludes by discussing how these framing techniques reflect preexisting social understandings of body modification practices while simultaneously informing and shaping the broader public opinion."
0,"The Japanese system of school-work has been widely admired for the strong communication and recruitment relationships that exist between high schools and employers.  Building on theoretical literature on employment systems and educational institutions, we develop a framework for understanding the macro-level conditions that fostered the effectiveness of Japans high school-work system up until the early 1990s.  These conditions included a stratified educational system, a large supply of high-quality high school graduates, and firm-internal labor markets for blue-collar workers in large firms.  We use original data from a sample of urban high schools to analyze how employers recruitment patterns changed in the 1990s and beyond.  The results of that analysis and a counterfactual analysis suggest that recent changes in Japanese employment institutions have had a significant impact on weakening school-employer relationships.  We suggest implications of the Japanese case for school-work processes in other postindustrial societies."
0,"This paper examines the role of local racial and ethnic groups and external organizations in creating specific types of charter schools in New York State. Prior work has shown that a combination of minority interests and conservative politics has helped the adoption of school choice policies at the state level. Other research has demonstrated that charter schools are often oriented to promoting local community identities and even specific racial and ethnic identities.  This contradicts an historic public school missionto create a cohesive national cultural identityand also undermines the historic tendency toward larger, more bureaucratic, and more centrally controlled schools and school districts. This paper argues that the tribal character of charter schooling and racial groups reliance on external conservative sponsors are valid descriptions of New York charter schools, but that the specific character of charters is dependent on a complex play between local conditions and the global institutional models that provide organizational scripts for action. This interplay provides the potential foundation for a new institutional framework for public education and suggests how institutionalist theory might be revised to account for this possibility."
0,"Academic observers of contemporary American politics tend to portray the political sector as characterized by little variation in the options for citizen-based action, represented by professional advocacy organizations that provide few avenues for meaningful civic involvement. This article challenges this dominant imagery and examines how much variety exists in the organizational models available for citizen voice at the national level in the United States and how the observed models are linked to the goals, strategies, and claims advanced by a diverse set of national advocacy groups. Analysis of a sample of Washington, DC-based political organizations identified five distinct models of organizing that differ significantly in terms of their structural characteristics and their association with the goals and activities that animate collective action at the national level in the United States. Keywords: advocacy, interest groups, social movements, civic engagement, organizational diversity."
0,"This paper examines the concept of hegemonic masculinity in the context of everyday cultural practices.  It is argued that black men often reaffirm their masculinity - which has classically been read as a subordinated form of masculinity - by the strategic embrace of hegemonic masculinity.  Using examples from ethnographic fieldwork into black sporting cultures, the paper shows how even within such moments of strategic hegemonic masculinity, the participants are engaged in highly reflexive actions.  That is to say, they are often aware of hegemonic masculinitys limitations and invoke the hegemonic moment for particular (political) ends.  It is further argued that there is always a degree of contestation with the dominant over how masculinity is performed within such settings.  Thus these negotiated ways of performing the masculine self, and of being a black man in particular, require us to avoid overly deterministic accounts of hegemonic masculinity that do not account for the dialectical construction of masculine identity.  This approach will hopefully lead to more nuanced ways of reading the complex intersections of race and ethnicity on the one hand, and gender and sexuality on the other, within peoples cultural practices and everyday life experiences."
0,"The paper explores an encounter between parents of different class backgrounds who meet in the context of childrens neighborhood baseball following a process of neighborhood gentrification in Philadelphia. Their encounter permits not just a look at how sport, in this case baseball, structured and processed neighborhood tensions but also how the competing class cultures of the two groups created conflicting expectations about rights in and responsibilities toward public space and voluntary organizations.  Evidence supporting this paper included: a) participant observation with a baseball organization over a decade; b) two years of systematic ethnographic fieldwork involving observations of more than 100 games in two boys age divisions and; c) 40 in-depth interviews with coaches and parents of the league. Differences in the way old-timers and newcomers related both to the neighborhood and to the league reflected a competing set of cultural values related to individual responsibility, group solidarity, and how best to promote childrens interests, a contrast between hierarchical communalism and child-centered individualism. The local space of boys baseball provides an opportunity to understand how these tensions unfolded over a thirty year period, leaving a space where class tension trumped race tensions as cross-class sympathies slowly evolved."
0,"We study trends in educational homogamy at six boundaries in the educational structure of 10 East-Asian societies and explain its variation using explanatory variables at the country, cohort and boundary level. Educational homogamy was higher at the higher boundaries in the educational structure. Since the 1950s it decreased at all but the lowest boundaries, indicating convergence to a relatively low level of homogamy. Educational homogamy is lower in societies that are more modern, have higher female employment and experienced less Confucian influence. Results support the general openness and the exclusivity hypothesis, which predict educational homogamy to decrease in modernizing societies and to be higher when the group of more highly educated is smaller. Findings suggest that the trend towards less educational homogamy is related to educational expansion."
0,"Scholars of immigration disagree about the role ethnic communities play in immigrant families' engagement in educational institutions. While some researchers argue that the concentration of disadvantaged ethnic groups may prevent meaningful engagement with schools, others argue that ethnic communities can possess resources that help immigrant families be involved in their children's schooling. In this study we use a nationally representative dataset of Hispanic children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) to determine if the relative size of the Hispanic population in the school affects levels of their parents' involvement in their education, as well as parents' perceptions of barriers to their involvement. Our results suggest that a large Hispanic presence in a child's school can help increase immigrant Hispanic parents' involvement in their children's schooling, but there are no benefits for US-born Hispanic parents, indicating that ethnic communities help immigrant families acculturate to American institutions.

0,"Scholars have called for increased attention to the diversity of experiences of people negotiating paid work and family life.  As such, this paper explores the gendered sources of work-to-family conflict for single mothers and fathers using data from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce (N = 490).  In particular the role of workplace factors, especially workplace culture in the form of organizational family support and supervisor support, are examined.  The analysis indicates that organizational family support is an important predictor of single fathers work-to-family conflict, while supervisor support appears to matter most for single mothers in reducing work-to-family conflict."
0,"This article uses data from a national representative employer-employee matched dataset to assess the race/sex disparity in workers' self-rated productivity levels. Findings show that a significant proportion of black men report that they cannot achieve high job productivity. We conduct regression analyses based on human capital, social closure, and social psychological models to identify the specific mechanisms that account for black men's low self-rated job productivity. We find that social psychological work relational issues such as closeness of supervision and job evaluation explain the race/sex disparity in self-rated productivity. Findings are considered in the context of emergent intersections of race and gender in accounting for disparities in workplace outcomes."

Fixed-effect regression models estimate the relationship between state program rules and liquid assets, vehicle assets, and net worth. The results suggest that more lenient asset limits in means-tested programs and more generous IDA rules may have positive effects on asset holdings among low-education families. "
0,"This research applies a transaction-focused institutional analysis to compare the value of political capital in different institutional domains of China's market economy Our results show that the value of political capital is associated with institutional domains of the economy in which agents can use political connections to secure advantages. Political capital is most fungible in institutional domains where government restricts economic activity. In this sense, the value of political connections in China does not differ fundamentally from patterns observable in established market economics. We interpret this as evidence suggesting China may have experienced a tipping point in its transition to a market economy around the turn of the new century."
0,"Although the effect of parents on children has been the focus of much research on health and families, the influence of children on their parents has been far less studied. In this paper, I examine the effect of the sex composition of children on the weight trajectory of mothers. I find that women who have teenage daughters weigh (on average) 4 lbs less than women with teenage sons, and that the presence of an additional daughter in the family depresses mothers' weights even further. I evaluate several hypotheses that might be generating this weight difference, including the possibility that women who have sons may have increased bargaining power, giving them leverage to gain weight; that women who have daughters may intensify their appearance-oriented behaviors; and that women who have sons may be exposed to more high-calorie eating environments. I also evaluate the possibility that biological mechanisms might be generating this weight gap. I find evidence in support of the bargaining power and appearance-oriented behavior hypotheses, and less evidence in support of the social eating and biological hypotheses. These results shed light on mechanisms of social inequality that may be occurring on a day-to-day basis within families."
0,"Recently the notion of the “personalized funeral” has become an increasingly popular phenomenon for some American funeral industry professionals and consumers. So as to aid in this personalization process, some mortuaries and funerary product manufacturers in the U.S. now offer commodity-themed funeral services and commodity branded burial and cremation products to consumers. Some industry insiders and outsiders, both, argue that these seemingly new personalization trends, as a whole, reflect a unique and unprecedented development in American funerary practices. In response, this paper is an attempt to contextualize these trends. While the primary purpose of this paper is to generate questions of sociological concern that will lend to future research endeavors, this present essay is intended to examine the social, cultural, and historical development of “the new American way of death” and locate which aspects “personalized funeral” warrant further sociological investigation."
0,"Even though competition is ubiquitous in American life, interpersonal competition has been neglected in studies of friendship.  Conceiving of interpersonal competition as an ongoing process in dyads motivated by self-evaluation, we analyzed survey data from a sample of 162 undergraduates who were asked questions about their closest friends of the same and opposite sex.  Scores on an interpersonal competition index indicated, as predicted in same-sex friendships, that men were more competitive than women.  Contrary to predictions, competition in cross-sex friendships was intermediate between competition in female and male same-sex friendships.  Among same-sex friends, competition was negatively associated with academic class and positively associated with number of role relationships other than being friends.  In both same- and cross-sex friendships, intimacy and companionship had a positive effect and competition had a negative effect on friendship satisfaction.  As in past research, women were more satisfied with their same-sex friendships than men, but the present study indicated that this was due to greater competition in male friendships.  In general, the present study fills a void in research on the dark side of friendships, suggesting that the fullest understanding of friendship must consider the influence of an apparently negative dimension, interpersonal competition."
0,"This paper looks at certain cultural trends surrounding the internet that contributed to the stock bubble of the 1990s. Focusing on the 1990-94 period, the paper explores how a contradictory fusion of countercultural discursive practices with the failure of economic and political leadership to anticipate the internet worked to fuse a kind of romantic iconoclasm with neolibertarian enthusiasms for markets and business entrepreneurialism. In Foucaultian terms, there was an ""incitement to discourse"" associated with the notion of an internet revolution, an eagerness ""to pronounce a discourse that combines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights."" That ""incitement,"" in turn, helped create the conditions in which a blind over-investment in the startup company Netscape created the model for the ""dot com"" economy of the ensuing years. By this means a set of cultural constructs came to play a key role in significant economic change."
0,"Two recent trends in marriage imply different consequences for the degree of heterogeneity in American society: Increasing racial intermarriage indicates higher levels of social integration, while continued educational homogamy potentially enlarges socioeconomic inequality. This article analyzes census 5 percent Public Use Micro Samples data from 1980 to 2000 and examines the two trends simultaneously. Results suggest that racial homogamy has gradually declined but remains as the strongest pattern. Educational homogamy shows a diverse pattern of change, with an overall flat or slightly declining trend, and the best educated and the least educated are both more homogamous than those who have intermediate levels of education. Those who intermarry by race tend to have higher levels of education, and there is a modest positive relationship between racial and educational heterogamy."
0,"We draw upon data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study to examine the effect of neighborhood socioeconomic composition on two key economic outcomes, and in doing so to test the validity of the index of concentration at the extremes (ICE) as a measure of neighborhood circumstances. Methodologically, we find that the index succinctly captures economic variation within neighborhoods in a way that avoids problems of colinearity that have characterized prior studies. Neighborhoods can be characterized as failing on a continuum ranging from concentrated disadvantage to concentrated advantage; the ICE measure does a good job capturing this variation and differentiating the neighborhood circumstances experienced by different groups. Substantively, we show that neighborhood economic circumstances are related to new mothers' welfare use and employment, above and beyond their individual socioeconomic characteristics.

0,"This paper introduces the concept of educational utilization as an overlooked part of the education-to-work transition and a potential mechanism by which occupational sex segregation is generated among the college-educated labor force. The paper begins with a critical discussion of the operationalization approaches that have been used in prior research that implicitly measures educational utilization. Multiple empirical measure of the concept are then developed using data from the O(*)NET and the National Surveys of College Graduates. The explanatory power of each measure is assessed using conditional logit models of occupational attainment. A combined measure is then used to assess sex differences in educational utilization using data from the 1993 and 2003 National Surveys of College Graduates for 2 cohorts of college graduates-those who earned their baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degrees and entered the labor market in the years 1985-1993 and 1995-2003. The analysis identifies sex differences in educational utilization that vary across field, degree level and cohort and concludes with an examination of the implications of sex differences in educational utilization for occupational segregation.

0,"I analyze historical changes in American immigration law and the subsequent responses of Chinese immigrants during the Chinese Exclusion Era. Using the political process model's concept of opolitical opportunity structure,o I examine how the indeterminate nature of the Chinese Exclusion laws provided key opportunities for mobilization. I present an interactive framework that considers not only how the broader political environment enabled and constrained the Chinese, but also how they responded by actively reshaping their environment. I apply this framework to the Chinese community's initial use of litigation and their move towards tactics of subterfuge in response to changes in Chinese exclusion policies. My findings show that the anti-Chinese immigration policies basically fulfilled their purpose, but led to unintended exploitation due to problematic language and enforcement."

0,"While individual effort is often lauded, its relationship to social outcomes remains imperfectly understood.  This paper investigates returns on high school effort for college completion using the National Educational Longitudinal Study.  I focus on possible differential returns to effort across socioeconomic and racial groups, a pattern which could explain observed differences in effort.  I find that returns are similar across groups and conclude that simple economic rationality cannot explain observed patterns.  I estimate the effect of a one standard deviation increase in effort to be roughly equivalent to a one quartile increase in socioeconomic status and use a series of counterfactuals to look at the relative magnitude of effort’s contribution to differential educational outcomes."
0,"Assimilation theorists have long viewed inter-group romantic partnerships as indicators of racial equality. Although the past half-century has witnessed the erosion of anti-miscegenation laws and subsequent increases in the frequency of interracial marriages, these unions remain relatively infrequent. Low intermarriage rates may be partially explained by the informal sanctions leveled at young interracial romances. This study tests whether adolescents who interracially date arc at greater risks of peer difficulties than intra-racially dating youth. Results demonstrate a positive relationship between adolescent interracial dating and peer trouble at school. As hypothcsized from ethnographic research and theories of inter-group relations, results suggest that interracial romances activate peer sanctions and that these reactions are strongest when romances involve black students."
0,"The relationship between assimilation and the well-being of immigrant children has been the focus of debate in the recent sociological literature. Much of this work has questioned whether classical theories of immigrant adaptation, which assumed assimilation to be an integral part of the process of upward mobility for immigrants, are still applicable to today's immigrant children. This study reevaluates the applicability of classical assimilation theory with a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between assimilation and the well-being of Hispanic and Asian immigrant adolescents. Using Add Health data, we examine the effect of different aspects of assimilation on educational achievement, psychological well-being, and at-risk behaviors. We find that the effect of assimilation varies greatly depending on the ethnic group and outcome under consideration, but that it is generally related to both greater academic achievement and more at-risk behavior. We conclude that assimilation theory is still relevant, but suggest an interpretation that emphasizes a process of decreasing differences between groups rather than either detrimental or beneficial effects of assimilation.

0,"We use panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to estimate the effects of cognitive skills (measured by the Armed Forces Qualification Test) and attitudinal/behavioral traits (a latent factor based on self-reported self-esteem, locus of control, educational aspirations and educational expectations) on career wage trajectories of white, black and Latino/a men and women. We find that both cognitive and attitudinal/behavioral traits affect initial wages and wage growth, above and beyond their effects on schooling and transcript-reported high school grades. The relative size of these effects, however, varies by race/ethnicity. We also show that black and Latino men, and black women have substantially flatter wage trajectories than white men and women. Using wage decomposition techniques, we find that the lower wages of these groups are partially, but not fully, accounted for by group differences in cognitive skill and attitudinal/behavioral traits."
0,"This paper expands upon recent literature on the international diffusion of management practices by analyzing the forces shaping the institutionalization of employee stock option programs (ESOs) in the Indian technology sector. In comparing the case of India to the institutionalization of these programs in the United States, data collected from interviews with managers and consultants in India indicates that the practice took on a different meaning in the Indian context. Although ESOs diffused rapidly among Indian technology companies during the late 1990s, these companies did not grant stock options as deeply within their organizational hierarchies as did technology companies in the United States. More importantly, the data reveal how forces at the individual, organizational, organizational field, and broader macroeconomic and sociocultural levels shaped the institutionalization of ESOs in India. The findings deepen our understanding of the contingent nature of the global diffusion of management practices by taking seriously the perspectives of actors who play key roles in implementing, structuring, and shaping the meaning and institutionalization of these practices."

0,"Explanations of the past both :VIM and influence the way we think about the present and future. Like artists and politicians, social movements develop a ""reputation"" that includes a capsule history of a movement's origins, goals, and impact. Both popular narratives and scholarly treatments identify four books published in the early 19605 as having spurred important social movements and government action. This ""big book myth"" provides a simple origins story for social movements, a version of an ""immaculate conception"" notion of social change. We compare the mythic accounts of feminist, environmental, anti-poverty, and consumer movements of the 1960s to fuller histories of these movements and find consistent distortions in the common big book narratives. Mythic accounts shorten the incubation time of social movements and omit the initiating efforts of government and political organizations. The myths develop and persist because they allow interested actors to package and contain a movement's origins, explicitly suggesting that broad social dynamics replicate idealized individual conversion stories. They also allow actors to edit out complicated histories that could compromise the legitimacy of a movement or a set of policy reforms. These mythic accounts spread and persist because they simplify complicated social processes and offer analogues to the individual process of becoming active, but they may lead us to misunderstand the past and make misjudgments about collective action and social change in the future. We consider those implications and call for more research on the construction of myths about the past."

0,"Past research suggests that sustaining a young identity helps adults maintain a greater sense of well-being. The experience of subjective aging, however, is not a spontaneous phenomenon, but stems from lifelong developmental experiences. Drawing from writings on the life course and self-concept, I consider how parental death in childhood shapes subjective age in adulthood. To examine the effects of maternal and paternal death on subjective age, I employ the Midlife Development in the United States Study (MIDUS). A series of linear regression analyses indicates that maternal death during childhood is associated with an older subjective age in adulthood, death of a father does not have a similar influence on subjective age, and that the effect on subjective age is stronger if maternal death occurred during childhood than during other periods of the life course. The findings highlight interconnections between timing of transitions in the life course, linked lives, and the development of self-concept. Subjective age in adulthood seems to hinge on important biographical experiences from childhood, such as parental death, though the processes differ by the gender of the deceased parent."
0,"A substantial body of research has explored the extent to which demographic traits of offenders and victims -- most notably race and gender -- influence who receives a death sentence for capital crimes.   Little is known, however, about how race and gender dynamics might pattern post-sentence outcomes.   Drawing upon evidence from male offenders sentenced to death in Texas during the years 1973 - 2007, we examine whether the race and ethnicity of offenders and victims, victim gender, and a number of case attributes influence the likelihood and timing of executions and commutations (whereby the offender leaves death row).   Cox regression analyses are used in conjunction with the MICE (multiple multivariate imputation by chained equations) method of handling a modest amount of missing data.  The results show that cases involving minorities -- with black or Latino offenders or victims -- have lower hazards of execution than cases in which both offenders and victims are white.  Victim and offender race and ethnicity, however, play no independent role in shaping the timing or likelihood of a commuted sentence.   Victim gender exerts a modest zero-order effect on executions and commutations, but the effect vanishes when case attributes are controlled."
0,"Children in Foster Care have difficulty in transitioning into adulthood once they age out of care. Youth often experience difficulties with housing, employment and education as many experience residential mobility or couch surfing as well as episodes of homelessness. Literature suggests that minority children are overrepresented in the foster care system. The primary purpose of this qualitative study is to examine a group of Latino alumni of Foster Care and their experiences related to housing. The sample included 32 foster care alumni ranging in age from 18 to 26. The study examined questions related to life experiences in placement, transition processes, and after aging out. Results reveal that as Latino youth age out of care they may be unsuccessful in attempts to re-establish family relationships, kinship and compadragzo cultural networks. Youth turn to peers for sustainability. The ability to survive is dependent upon episodes of couch surfing and residential mobility."
0,"Growing corporate power, the geographic fragmentation of production, and the predominance of neoliberal policies have challenged and undermined traditional methods of labor market regulation.  Globalization processes have produced a downward pressure on labor standards that neither nationally based labor laws nor international institutions such as the International Labor Organization have been effectively able to counter.  Thus, unions and other civil society organizations have pushed for new approaches to the regulation of labor standards.  In this context, privatized forms of regulation have emerged as alternatives and/or supplements to legislative mechanisms.  This paper assesses International Framework Agreements (IFAs)  labor standards agreements negotiated between TNCs and Global Unions - in attempt to determine their capacities to construct effective mechanisms of transnational labor rights regulation.  The paper argues that by facilitating social dialogue between TNCs and global unions, IFAs show potential to provide stronger accountability mechanisms than do unilateral corporate codes of conduct.  Yet IFAs are limited by a top-down, voluntaristic approach to labor rights regulation.  For mechanisms of transnational labor rights regulation to move beyond these limitations, they must more effectively combine emergent privatized initiatives with traditional regulatory strategies such as local labor laws and collective agreements to ensure the enforcement of international labor norms."

I examine whether more time in the U.S. increases school misbehavior by testing the effects of immigrant generation and indicators of acculturation on three measures of disciplinary problems during the senior year of high school-attending class unprepared, getting in trouble for breaking school rules, and being put on suspension. First and one-point-five generation immigrants attend class more prepared and get into less trouble for breaking the school rules than do third or higher generation students during their senior year of high school. High academic performance and indicators of acculturation explain only part of this beneficial effect of immigrant generation on behavior at school. Additional analyses show that second generation Asian immigrants are more similar to first and 1.5 generation immigrants from all racial and ethnic groups than they are from other second generation racial and ethnic groups in regards to moderate and intermediate behavior.

0,"This study examines the effects of internal democracy and competition between unions on changes in membership. Inspired by the split in the AFL-CIO during 2005, I develop measures of union competition and propose to collect data on rival unions during the 20th century. The working hypotheses are that competition has a positive effect on unionization and that democracy is forged during periods of competition. Time-series graphs will depict new data on competition between unions, the trajectories of more and less internally democratic unions and rates of change in union membership."
0,"This paper reports on ethnographic research of contemporary artists’ careers and practices in two mid-size cities: Portland, Oregon and Nashville, Tennessee. While many studies of the art world take place in New York – the ‘center’ of the U.S. art world – the majority of American artists live in ‘off-center’ cities that do not organize the same scale of art world resources, markets, and institutions. This paper argues that local art worlds are embedded in an extra-local field of contemporary art production that produces and allocates rewards differently across places. An artist’s reputation in this contemporary art world is in part a function of her ability to affiliate with particular places, to draw on the symbolic capital that such place affiliations afford. Artists in off-center cities live out trans-local careers; they employ strategies at the local level to remain relevant in the larger art world. This paper outlines three key strategies: 1) Artists angle to make connections to other cities by networking with art world actors from elsewhere; 2) they work to make their city a recognized, and thus legitimate site of art production; 3) they make place distinctions, investing symbolically in their city by defining it vis-à-vis other cities."
0,"Since the 1970’s the U.S. has experienced the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, new environmental laws, and deindustrialization.  These changes have led to a broad decline in exposure to air pollution across America (Kahn 1997; Portney 1990).  However, we are unsure if the benefits of these changes are occurring equally for all demographic groups across the U.S.  This study investigates the question of whether the changes in air pollution exposure have differed across racial and socioeconomic groups by using data from the Environmental Protection Agency on the emissions of over 600 air pollutants, modeled for the risk they pose to human health.  Preliminary analyses show the unequal exposure by region, race and education.  Predictably, those EPA regions within the industrial corridor have starkly higher pollution exposure and greater differences in exposure by race. Across the U.S., African-Americans consistently have the highest estimated exposure across time.  After breaking down racial groups into educational categories, we can see that African-Americans of all educational categories trend to having greater pollution exposure than any other racial/educational group.   Although African-Americans are still the most polluted group in 2004, the reduction of their exposure has been much steeper than any other group.  Amongst white and Hispanic individuals, those with a high school education or less have the greatest exposure, followed by those with a college education and graduate degree."
0,"Culture and politics have a close relationship, but how exactly does the cultural become the political? This article builds a theoretical framework for this question by examining Vietnamera U.S. poets' politicization of Buddhism at the expense of more effective or more easily controllable discursive resources. I find, first, that outcomes depend on whether wouldbe appropriators and legitimate owners of the appropriated resource can strike a mutually beneficial bargain. Second, whether two such distinct parties emerge depends on how tightly contexts of the appropriation process are linked. Consequently, appropriation is best understood as reciprocal exchange."
0,"This article probes the issue of stigma generated by the interaction of facially disfigured cancer patients with strangers and acquaintances (secondary groups). Now, patients with cancer of the face survive. As they survive, they spend significant portions of their lives dealing with stigma. Limited knowledge is available on the interaction processes leading to the creation of stigma for facially disfigured cancer patients. This article addresses this gap in the literature by reporting the results of a qualitative study of individuals who remained facially disfigured as a result of required surgery and cancer treatments. In-depth interviews with patients and their family members were conducted and analyzed employing grounded theory. Three primary analytical categories were generated to illustrate interaction with secondary groups: intrusion, sympathy, and benign neglect. These categories refer to conditions that are decreasingly favorable to the creation of stigma whereby intrusion and sympathy foster stigma while benign neglect does not."
0,"This article investigates how experiences with public policies affect levels of civic and political engagement among the poor. Studies of ''policy feedback'' investigate policies not just as political outcomes, but also as factors that set political forces in motion and shape political agency. To advance this literature, we take up three outstanding questions related to selection bias, the distinction between universal and targeted programs, and the types of authority relations most likely to foster engagement among the poor. Using a longitudinal dataset from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, which follows a cohort of low-income parents and their newborn children in 20 U.S. cities, we estimate effects associated with three types of means-tested public assistance. We find that these policies' effects are not an illusion created by selection bias; the effects of targeted programs can both promote and discourage engagement; and such effects tend to be more positive when a policy's authority structure reflects democratic rather than paternalist principles."
0,"Cognitive scientists have recently developed a concept known as extended cognition, distributed cognition, or external cognition. This concept suggests that the human brain works in interaction with the surrounding physical and social environment and offloads some of its cognitive duties onto the environment. This paper unites the concept of extended cognition with the urban theorizing of Simmel, Wirth, and Durkheim who were concerned with the effect large cities would have on the human mind. The author argues that the city can be viewed as a single complex cognitive system where human minds are intertwined with the urban material and social environment. The intricate urban division of labor, street layout, and physical landmarks are discussed as examples of how the urban form aids the brain. The implications of viewing urban areas as a single cognitive system are also briefly considered."
0,"Risk society theory posits that the transformation of industrial to postindustrial society corresponded with a transformation of societal power structured by capital, to one structured by the ability to define risk. Perceptions of risk are, in part, socially constructed and created through the framing efforts of various institutional actors. The resulting struggle over meaning is particularly acute when the issues contain many unknown elementsas is the case with emerging technologies. Applying insights from media studies, frame analysis, and organizational theory, we analyze coverage of nanotechnology (NT) in popular press, trade, and general science publications. The findings document the extent to which the risks of this emerging technology are presented or ignored across, between, and within organizational subfields. The analysis empirically assesses a key proposition of risk society theory and reveals how institutional processes reflect and reproduce power differentials. We discuss the implications of the empirical findings for sociological theories of risk and society, power, and collective action."
0,"Prior research suggests a correlation between incarceration and marital dissolution, although questions remain as to why this association exists. Is it the stigma associated with ""doing time"" that drives couples apart? Or is it simply the duration of physical separation that leads to divorce? This research utilizes data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and the Survey of Officer and Enlisted Personnel to shed light on these questions. The findings generally support a separation explanation of the incarceration-divorce relationship. Specifically, the data show that exposure to incarceration has no effect on marital dissolution after duration of incarceration is taken into account. In addition, across both datasets we find that individuals who spend substantial time away from spouses are at higher risk of divorce. The findings point to the importance of spousal separation for understanding the incarceration-marital dissolution relationship. Moreover, and in contrast to settings in which stigma appears quite salient (e.g., labor markets), our results suggest that the shared history and degree of intimacy among married partners may weaken the salience of the stigma of incarceration. Findings are discussed in the context of a burgeoning body of work on the collateral consequences of incarceration and have implications for the growing pool of men in American society returning from prison."
0,"This study estimates the effects of prenatal poverty on birth weight using changes in state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) as a natural experiment. We seek to answer two questions about poverty and child wellbeing. First, are there associations between prenatal poverty and lower birth weights even after factoring out unmeasured potential confounders? Because birth weight predicts a range of outcomes across the life course, lower birth weights that result from poverty may have lasting consequences for children's life chances. Second, how have recent expansions of a work-based welfare program (i.e., the EITC) affected maternal and infant health? In recent decades, U. S. poverty relief has become increasingly tied to earnings and labor markets, but the consequences for children's wellbeing remain controversial. We find that state EITCs increase birth weights and reduce maternal smoking. However, results related to AFDC/TANF and varying EITC effects across maternal ages raise cautionary messages."
0,"Why does the adherence to norms not prevent conflict? While the current literature focuses on the emergence, maintenance and impact of norms with regard to cooperation, the issue of norm-related conflict deserves more attention. We develop a general game theoretical model of ""normative conflict"" and explain how transaction failures on the macrolevel can result from cooperative motives on the microlevel. We differentiate between two kinds of conflict. The first results from distinct expectations regarding the way in which general normative obligations should be fulfilled, the second from distinct expectations as to how the norm should restrain actions based on self-interest. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of normative conflict in a version of the ultimatum game. Our data reveal widespread normative conflict among different types of actors - egoistic, equity, equality and cherry picker. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative intentions about how to divide a collectively produced good may fail to produce cooperative outcomes."
0,"We suggest that studying the state, women and terrorism would benefit from systematic research from the areas of deviance and social control, politics, the state and international law.   While the importance of a historical and cultural analysis is frequently acknowledged, most research on terrorism and women is narrow in scope, providing sweeping individual-oriented generalizations and reductionist chronologies.  The construction of terrorism, however,  is a critical part of the production of hegemony including specific conceptions of ideological/political boundaries and dominant historical narratives.  Though female participation in terrorism has historically been low, explanations accounting for this lack of participation are insufficient as research on women and terrorism is insufficient.  Today, interest in the involvement of women in terrorist activity is reappearing, especially since Muslim females appear to be increasingly used to carry out suicide attacks in the Middle East.  Though significantly less than men, women also have been involved in terrorist activity, and have even been in leadership positions.  More notable, however, is the fact that most womens struggles challenging the state throughout history are characterized by an absence of violence.  Terrorism is currently defined and widely understood as a particular type of (political) violence created by fanatical or psychologically abnormal individuals and groups who spread fear among innocent victims.  Terrorism, however,  is a manifestation of a much more complex societal construction, that of domination and hierarchy.  Here we suggest the importance of a more systematic understanding of terrorism and of womens participation in terrorism."
0,"In this study we examine the incomes of families headed by women who give birth out of wedlock.  We document the changing social and economic characteristics of these mothers, and whether these changes have led to gains in family income.  Using Current Population Survey data collected between 1982 and 2002, we find that never-married mothers remain poor.  They have made some marginal economic gains, but these have disproportionately occurred at the top of the income distribution.  Interestingly, never-married mothers incomes have stagnated in spite of impressive gains in education and other personal and vocational characteristics that should have resulted in greater economic progress."
0,"Drawing on two years of ethnographic observation and interviews, this study investigates the academic performance of men’s community college basketball players.  I find that although community college student athletes face significant challenges in their educational careers, several factors contribute positively to basketball players’ academic performance, including the intertwining of their athletic and academic goals, extra resources that facilitate academic success, players’ self-enhancement of their own scholarship prospects, and their integration into a social system that values transferring to baccalaureate institutions.  As a result, community college basketball players perform better academically than other community college students despite their socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds.  This finding is in contrast to scholarship on traditional intercollegiate athletes, who perform worse than their non-athlete peers."
0,"On-line platforms for socially generated content, such as Wikipedia, allow everyone to contribute and remove the contributions of others. This presents a trade-off: on the one hand, content improves quickly and mistakes are eliminated; on the other hand, deletion of content deprives its authors of the intrinsic pleasure of contributing and seeing their work in print, which may lead them to stop participating. We suggest that this trade-off is attenuated by the social structure around contributors. We hypothesize that actors involved in high density and high encapsulation structures will be least likely to abandon contributing. Analysis of the pattern of contributions to Wikipedia supports this assertion. The results underscore the importance of tight social structure for the success of collaborative content projects."
0,"This article examines how class inequality may have influenced the historical use of executions in the United States, both within the South and outside of the South. Specifically, this article asks whether executions acted as a mechanism to maintain an exploitative class system in the entire United States, just as lynching maintained a racial caste system in the South. Much of the literature on the historical determinants of macrolevel execution rates has examined these disparities in terms of racial inequality. This study demonstrates that racial inequality alone cannot account for the high number of executions that typified the early twentieth century United States and contends that it is important to expand our understanding of the effects of class inequality on both historical and contemporary trends in executions."
0,"Participatory democracy is a theme running through the history of progressive social movements and community organizing. Pollettas (2004) recent analysis of the United States civil rights, new left, womens and other movements brings to the fore important innovations and key tensions in the development of cultures and mechanisms that support participatory democracy. While she also discusses contemporary faith-based community organizing in groups such as the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), her analysis misses some of the key cultural and procedural means by which these organizations try to manage the tensions she insightfully identifies. Based on ten years of participant observation of, and collaborative work with, community organizations in the Gamaliel Foundation network, a group similar to the IAF, I describe and analyze these means, and examine how well they manage the tensions identified by Polletta, and how they create new tensions."
0,"Various models of agency and decision making in organizational crime are discussed, including those of organizational agency, individual rational choice, and organizational structures.  These models have generally been applied to corporate crime; the more recently introduced concept of state-corporate crime further complicates the issues that these models address.  The Rocky Flats scandal is examined, in order to determine which model best conceptualizes agency and decision making in an episode of state-corporate crime.  An organizational-structures model is favored; it is concluded furthermore that sociologists need to pay careful attention to the complex and sometimes conflicting roles that the state can play in state-corporate crimes."
0,"Peer influence is regarded as one of the strongest determinants of adolescents' behavior. Yet the concept of peer influence has been studied almost exclusively in terms of dyadic friendship relations. Based on actors' similar positions in the friendship network, the authors test an alternative mechanism of influence in this article, drawing on insights from network-inspired theories. This study focuses on both sexual activity and school deviant behavior. The authors used data from the Flemish Educational Assessment Study, which collected complete network data from a representative sample of Flemish secondary school adolescents (N = 11,872), clustered in 160 networks. Results indicate that best friends influence both adolescents' sexual activity and their school deviancy. However, the authors found no evidence of influence between actors who share a similar position in the network."
0,"In contrast to earlier in the pandemic, now, net of other demographic factors, formal education acts as a preventative factor in the HIV/AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, but there has been almost no research on the causal factor behind the widely reported education effects.  Two assumed educational mechanisms of information-transfer and attitude change on the use of condoms for adults with multiple sexual partners are tested.  Finding only weak evidence in support of these mechanisms, a new hypothesis about how education enhances health reasoning is developed and tested. Structural equation modeling of the influence of education attainment on condom use and its mediation by basic facts, attitudes, and health reasoning are estimated with Demographic Health Survey data from SSA nine nations collected between 2003-2005 finds that net of control variables, there is a robust, positive significant influence of education on condom use among sexually risky adults.  Although formal education increases acquisition of basic facts and the inculcation of positive attitudes, these commonly assumed effects of formal education have only weak influence on condom use. Instead, education robustly influences health reasoning ability and this factor mediates a significant proportion of the education effect on condom use.  Future research on the causal mechanism behind the association between education and HIV/ AIDS prevention should focus on the health reasoning enhancement of attending school."
0,"Deemed ‘model minorities,’ second-generation Chinese-Americans have, on average, high levels of educational attainment and, as a result, they have experienced more upward mobility than other groups. Yet, on the other side of the Atlantic, a strikingly different story about Chinese immigrants and their offspring emerges. Based on analysis of the Longitudinal Study of the Second Generation in Spain, findings from this study show that Chinese youths in Spain have substantially lower educational ambitions and attainment than youths from every other nationality. Met with discrimination at school and in the labor market, yet finding financial success in niche markets as small business owners, I argue that the Chinese in Spain have, at least temporarily, forged an alternative pathway of mobility based on entrepreneurial endeavors rather than educational accomplishments – a formula passed on from immigrant parents to their offspring. The way Chinese youths in Spain have calibrated their ambition represents a form of strategic adaptation to the barriers put up against immigrant minorities in Spanish society."
0,"Previous studies have shown that residents of neighborhoods with the concentration of poverty and female-headed households are at higher risk for depression. This study examines the effect of socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood on individual mental health by considering two possible mediating mechanisms: perceived neighborhood disorder and social relationships (social support and neighborhood social ties). The data were obtained from the 1995 Community, Crime, and Health survey sample consisting of 2482 adults and from a 1998 follow-up survey. Findings indicate that residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher levels of psychological distress than do residents of more advantaged neighborhoods with the introduction of social relationships and neighborhood disorder as mediators. Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with depression in three ways: (1) neighborhood disadvantage increased depression directly, (2) neighborhood disadvantage increased depression by way of neighborhood disorder, and (3) neighborhood disadvantage decreased depression through enhanced social relationships.

0,"Using complete census tract, county, and PMSA analog data with longitudinally fixed (standardized) boundaries for the entire United States in 1980, 1990, and 2000, we investigate potential homogenizing trends within spatial areas hypothesized by Massey and others but contradicted by the theorizing of Florida and others. The results for seven socio-demographic variables show a trend toward increasing similarity in the majority of socio-demographic variables in all types of spatial units examined. However, we observe increasing heterogeneity in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data, suggesting that theories of social change and spatial characteristics may benefit from some degree of theoretical integration in which the circumstances under which homogenization or heterogenization may be most likely are better specified theoretically.

0,"This study examines the wage gender gap of young adults in the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000 in the US. Using quantile regression we estimate the gender gap across the entire wage distribution. We also study the importance of high school characteristics in predicting future labor market performance. We conduct analyses for three major racial/ethnic groups in the US: Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics, employing data from two rich longitudinal studies: NLS and NELS. Our results indicate that while some school characteristics are positive and significant predictors of future wages for Whites, they are less so for the two minority groups. We find significant wage gender disparities favoring men across all three surveys in the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000. The wage gender gap is more pronounced in higher paid jobs (90th quantile) for all groups, indicating the presence of a persistent and alarming ""glass ceiling."" (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Results of past research on social cohesion in socially and economically disadvantaged suggest two contradictory sets of findings: 1) residents of these neighborhoods have few ties and thus low levels of social cohesion and 2) residents of these neighborhoods actually have large networks with strong ties and thus high levels of social cohesion. I argue that this research emphasizes primary ties, that is ties between people who interact routinely, and that because of this, the findings from these studies are incomplete. I suggest employing an interactionist approach to provide a more complete understanding of this issue. This will facilitate the ability to first, assess levels of social cohesion on a community level, second, better ascertain the processes by which social cohesion is generated and third, examine particular dimensions of the concept of social cohesion that have traditionally been overlooked. The study presented here examines racial differences in interaction on public transportation as a way of gauging social cohesion. Specifically, I look at interactions between strangers of the same race.  Findings support the claim that poor, black neighborhoods have high levels of social cohesion.  These findings also demonstrate that this cohesion is significant in that it plays a role in the production of common notions of a particular black reality and collective black identity and that it has a normative function in defining appropriate types of behavior."
0,"In the early 1990s, the development of a national health information strategy and the subsequent National Population Health Survey was crucial in the adoption and fortification of a standardized theory-methods package (Fujimura 1996) of population health in Canada. In this paper, I illuminate some of the events, structural conditions, and the network of individual and organizational actors that together enabled these developments. Canadas health information strategy and the NPHS were explicit interventions of the state in the realm of public health. Federal, provincial and territorial officials grappled with several critical conditions, namely: a persistent climate of fiscal restraint; continued escalation of health care costs; an emergent culture of evidence-based decision making; technological advances; the limits of chronic disease epidemiology and lifestyle health promotion; and significant data and information deficits. The standardized package of population health and the instrument of the NPHS provided the means to answer the disciplinary needs of the state in ways that the previous theory-methods package of health promotion could not. Specifically, the NPHS was an inscription device that produced immutable mobiles (statistical data), enabling the state to administer public health and health resources with enhanced authority (Latour 1987). The NPHS produced data that was hitherto unavailable, and the emergence of new analytical technologies promised much-sought-after refinement and linking of population health data. Bureaucratic elements of the federal government thus became components of a primary centre of calculation (Latour 1987) for the production of population health knowledge in Canada."
0,"Survey methodologists are concerned that the interviewer's characteristics may affect respondents' answers. This paper investigates how the inter-viewer's education interacts with the respondent's perceptions and in turn affects the latter's responses to hard questions in a biotechnology survey in Taiwan. Our results indicate that respondents with little education (Junior high school or below) react to highly-educated interviewers by giving more substantive answers to both knowledge questions and attitude questions. These findings are consistent with findings in the literature on social psychology whereby the respondents can infer from the interviewer's appearance and behavior whether the latter seems more knowledgeable than themselves, and that in interacting with someone with much more education, the one with little education senses his or her inferiority and tries to conform to the perceived expectations.

0,"Based on data collected through mailed questionnaires and semi-structured telephone interviews within the federal public service, this paper examines the transformation of work to a call centre service delivery model at Service Canada and develops a profile of federal government employees who work in call-centre capacities. The provision of public service through call centres is an efficiency measure, an outcome of the trend toward a globalized economy and the adoption of neo-liberal government structures.  Despite their unionized status and relatively secure jobs, workers compare their jobs to those in sweat shops and factory production lines and reflect on the move toward standardized labour practices and their dehumanizing effects.  Many workers regard the adoption of an efficiency model as incompatible with the goals of the public service.  This new workplace culture is associated with different career trajectories and notions regarding public service for older and younger workers."
0,"Much of the immigration literature in the United States points toward a positive association between religious activity and immigrant economic adaptation. Immigrant congregations serve as informal job fairs, build social capital for entrepreneurial activity, and provide a locale for leadership skill development. Using the New Immigrant Survey, this hypothesis of religion as economic resource is tested among immigrants receiving permanent residency within the United States in 2003. Somewhat surprisingly, most findings indicate a null relationship between religion and economic outcomes (i.e. employment, occupation status, and earnings). However, in instances where a significant relationship does exist, non-Protestant immigrants suffer the greatest economic penalty, particularly among non-Protestants who are not regularly participating in a religious organization. In contrast, non-Protestants who regularly participate have a higher likelihood of employment and higher earnings than their non-participating counterparts. Therefore, this paper extends previous literature in specifying that the religion as resource hypothesis operates best for non-Protestant immigrants who are actively involved in their religious organizations.

0,"This paper examines the impact and perception of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, from the perspective of patients.  While a patient-centric focus is rare in the existing literature on HIPAA, such an orientation is important for several reasons:  First, patients are ostensibly the primary intended beneficiaries of the HIPAA regulations, and yet we currently know little about how patients have actually been affected.  Second, while patients are not full-time participants in most healthcare organizations, patients nonetheless are both influenced by and exert influence upon healthcare organizations and related legal environments.  Finally, our evidence suggests that the HIPAA Privacy Rule may act, among other things, as a ""symbolic law"" with significant unintended consequences stemming from interactions between health care organizations and patients."
0,"Despite the close political regulation of union recognition disputes, sociologists have paid little attention to recent political determinants of success in these contests. A state-centered political-opportunity approach suggests that if conservative political officials can reduce the number of union recognition elections, union organization will be blocked. Partly because man labor scholars claim there was a postwar departure in labor movement fortunes, we attempt to detect and model a contingent break in the relationship between Republican control of the presidency and these elections using interactive specifications. Our findings show that shortly after the conservative, anti-union Reagan administration took office, recognition elections, and union victories in these elections, fell sharply. With macroeconomic and other determinants held constant, other political conditions with explanatory power include congressional oversight committee ideology and conservative appointments to the key regulatory agency. Our findings support political accounts and also suggest that unions' failures to organize new workplaces were sustained by subsequent conservative administrations."
0,"This research begins to analyze the notion of stereotype threat and the internalization of stereotypes affecting black and Hispanic students’ performance in college classrooms being a “threat in the air” (Aronson 2004; Aronson et al. 1999; Fischer 2010; Massey et al. 2003; Massey and Fischer 2005; Massey and Mooney 2007; Steele 1997; Steele and Aronson 1995). Theoretical assumptions of stereotype threat have assumed an “activation” of stereotypes within a social setting placing a burden on minority students, hindering their ability to perform (Aronson 2004; Aronson et al. 1999; Sacket et al. 2004; Steele 1997; Steele and Aronson 1995). This paper is a preliminary examination separating the effects of the source of stereotype threat in college environment into instructor and peer stereotype threat. Hypotheses generated remain consistent with the original work done by Steele and Aronson (1995), with a separation of the source of the fear of confirming the stereotype. The analysis presented in this manuscript is based on a sample of 449 black and 393 Hispanic students collected by The Science Study each fall and spring between the spring of 2006 and the spring of 2009. Preliminary findings indicate general support for Steele and Aronson’s hypotheses regarding instructor stereotype threat, but reverse effects for peer stereotype threat on black and Hispanic students GPA."
0,"This paper profiles labor support doulas, the current state of their occupation, and the ongoing negotiations to win doulas a legitimate place on the medical birth team.  Labor support doulas provide continuous labor support to birthing women, offering physical and emotional support from the start of contractions until about two hours postpartum.  They have no medical or clinical training. Doulas carefully negotiate their role in the labor room, crafting covert signals with their clients because they are unable to actively advocate on behalf of their clients in the presence of a medical care provider.  Ultimately, doulas must negotiate their role with three constituents:  their clients, with birthing womens partners/spouses and with the medical provider.  In their effort to create a distinct professional identity, doulas walk a fine line, constantly negotiating their role as advocates with their private clients and with medical caregivers.  Doulas do not have autonomy over their work and they cannot claim ownership of any distinct body of expert knowledge.  While they attempt to bring honor and respect back to the birthplace, they are at the mercy of the very institution that they are ideologically fighting against.  Doulas negotiations for a place in the birthing room are ongoing; they continually negotiate their role through various legal and medical channels.  I explore these negotiations and their implications for doulas as an occupational group and for the delivery of continuous labor support to women.  I utilize interviews with practicing doulas and a case-study to underscore doulas unique situation."
0,"This article draws upon two waves of interviews with environmental movement members in British Columbia, Canada, in order to examine participants' interpretations of the relationship between gender and environmental politics. Four claims emerge from this analysis. First, our results support the notion that there is an affinity between environmental politics and feminism. Second, despite recent critiques of ecomaternalism and the dual subjugation of nature and women within ecofeminism, these discourses remain useful as interpretive resources for research participants. Third, while ecomaternalism is a recurrent theme, it appears to be declining in relative importance as a discursive resource. Finally, notions of hegemonic masculinity are becoming more salient as an interpretive framework. While the first two claims emphasize continuity in participants' interpretive framework, the latter findings describe shifts in participants' understandings of gender and environmental politics."
0,"This study uses population data of the Netherlands (municipality registers) between 1995 and 2008 to describe and explain the occurrence of divorce among recently newlywed interethnic and mono-ethnic couples (N = 116,745). In line with homogamy theory, divorce risks are higher for interethnic couples, in particular if the spouses were born and raised in countries that are culturally distant from each other. In addition, the effect of cultural distance is smaller for second generation immigrants than for first generation immigrants. There is no evidence for a higher risk of divorce among Black-White marriages. In line with convergence theory, results show that the higher the divorce propensity in the wife's origin country, the higher the divorce risk of a couple is. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

I bring together three perspectives: firstly that the distribution of disease reflects a society's positioning of groups in categories of high risk; secondly that high HIV among young women reflects their uniquely dangerous transition to adulthood and illustrate this looking at education; and finally, by understanding transactional sex among young women not just as risky sexual behavior, but rather as a product of the particular social structures and life course trajectories, and consumerist age in which they are embedded.  I use qualitative data from Kenya."
0,"A great deal of scholarship investigates the effects of parenting on adults who parent. While existing literature has identified the ways in which parenting affects parents adversely, we argue that more attention needs to be paid to how having children may enhance parents' lives. Thus, we draw upon twenty-four in-depth interviews with young parents in order to investigate this process. First, we identify five ways in which parents say caregiving has changed their worldviews, relationships, and expectations, leading them to 1) erect barriers, 2) aspire for more, 3) view parenthood as a second chance, 4) hew a new path, and 5) make connections. Second, we uncover two central metaphors that parents rely on to explain the effect that having responsibility for children has had on their lives: the child as witness and the child as tether. We also point to future areas of investigation, arguing that only with an adequate understanding of what parenting does to parents can we understand what changing trends in families and inequality hold for ourselves and our futures."
0,"The study explores the foreign born aging population in the Phoenix metropolitan area who are users of two ethnically clustered senior centers. The goal is to explore how ethnic clustering influences everyday interactions among seniors, and how those interactions in turn influence the flow of resources among seniors as well as between them and their family members. The study contextualizes the experiences of predominantly Latino and Asian seniors within an aging society and the current political climate in Arizona, where economy remains stagnant on the one hand, and the race and ethnicity have become highlighted within the immigration debate on the other. Based on a series of participant observation and in-depth interviews, we found that ethnicity is only a factor that influences the interactions that take place at the center. Instead, how seniors spend their time outside of centers, for instance, work and living arrangement, dictate the use of senior centers, and ultimately, the resources that flow among the seniors. With the retrenching of public fund and growing interest in private resources, the trend that seniors continue to participate in labor force is expected to increase. Furthermore, informal exchanges may be expected to compensate for the shortage of public resources among foreign born seniors. These external factors in addition to ethnicity influence the nature of senior centers."

0,"The inequality in the relative years of education between blacks and whites has diminished dramatically over the 20th century. One possible explanation for this convergence is a virtuous cycle of parents passing on educational advantage, from one generation to the next, leading to an overall educational upgrading. In this paper we test the virtuous cycle hypothesis by estimating the three way interaction of cohort, race, and family background. We find that the convergence in educational attainment between blacks and whites over the past century was driven by processes unrelated to family background. "
0,"This paper examines how the military drawdown in the early 1990s influenced aggregate trends in employment and college enrollment, evaluating whether the loss of military jobs resulted in observable increases or decreases in employment rates and/or college enrollment rates. Contrary to the expectation of worsening employment among black men in particular, the drawdown had little effect on employment. However, changes in military service did have a considerable impact on college enrollment among black men. The loss of military jobs was actually associated with substantial increases in college going; college enrollments among black men may have been as much as 10% points lower had they served in the military at the same levels observed in the early 1980s.

0,"Drawing on integrated analysis of Israeli statistics and social research (including the 2001 survey among 800 Russian Israelis), this article explores the birth of a transnational community of Russian Jews living in Israel and in other branches of the post-Soviet diaspora. Theoretical focus of the paper is the relationship between transnationalism and immigrant integration in the host country. It is shown that due to its timing and composition, Russian Aliyah of the 1990s was readily transnational at the outset. Transnational activities among Russian Israelis lie mainly in socio-cultural realm and are intertwined with cultural separatism from the host society. During the 1990s, Russian-speakers, making 20 percent of the Jewish population, have created a thriving subculture of their own. It is shown that reliance on co-ethnic networks plays a double role in the life of Israeli Russians. On one hand, it empowers the weakest and the least integrated segments of the Russian community, attenuating their dependency on the host society. Yet, at the same time, it hampers economic success and social integration of many other immigrants, and reinforces cultural conflict between the newcomers and old-timers in Israel."
0,"When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in late August 2005, New Orleans residents were thrown into dangerous and uncertain situations.  Economically marginal individuals found themselves in vulnerable positions as they evacuated to new cities and eventually faced relocation.  Katrina survivors had an immediate need for basic necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, and medical care.  They also had a longer-term need for assistance in re-establishing themselves and rebuilding their lives.  This paper presents preliminary findings about the experiences survivors in Texas had with receiving assistance in the first months after the hurricane.  Survivors experiences of searching out and receiving assistance are examined in the context of the limited nature of the US welfare state.  Given the incompleteness of government assistance to low-income people, non-governmental organizations have become more important in the provision of social services.  The failure of FEMA has been widely noted, but not widely acknowledged as part of a larger problem of an inadequate social service system for the economically disadvantaged in this society.  Katrina was a unique occurrence in many respects, but it revealed some very commonplace social problems in the US.  The delays and confusion surrounding federal hurricane assistance forced survivors to depend heavily on assistance from other sources, though this assistance was not stable or long term.  Few respondents found assistance adequate or easy to access.  Although Katrina presented unique challenges to the government and social service agencies, it revealed everyday problems with social service delivery in the US."
0,"Immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to abuse: the intersection of their gender, sexuality, class, race, ethnicity, and immigration status stimulates nationalistic anxieties and multiplies the effects of both interpersonal and structural violence. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (VTVPA) acknowledge these disadvantages by providing legal protection and access to citizenship for battered immigrants. While advocates, activists and scholars alike have considered VAWA and VTVPA as successful achievements for women’s and immigrants’ rights movements, formal and informal barriers that filter immigrants as worthy to become legitimate members of the United States, or as illegitimate subjects remain in place. Based on activist research at a nonprofit organization in Texas, I uncover how gender, sexual, racial, ethnic, and class inequalities not only permeate the current legislation, but also are reproduced by nonprofit workers. This results in the exclusion of the most underprivileged immigrants, regardless of their histories of abuse. In this paper, I focus on one sole aspect of this phenomenon, that of the preservation of a heteronormative patriarchal social order.  In mirroring the family-based immigration system, VAWA and the clauses in VTVPA for battered immigrants married to undocumented immigrants are still influenced by the legacies of the English common-law doctrine of coverture, under which women lost their legal existence upon marriage. These inherited biases counteract the potential of VAWA and VTVPA as means to end violence against immigrant women."
0,"This article offers an innovative theoretical approach to black-white labor market inequality that combines components of threat, spatial mismatch, and urban decline theories in a queuing framework. Using a unique measure-the earnings gap between black and white workers resulting from sorting into different occupations within an occupationally and educationally delimited labor queue-the author tests hypotheses from the combined model. Results show support for the combined model, as characteristics of labor and job queues significantly influence the extent of black-white inequality. Variables representing employers' preferences for or against hiring black workers are also significant, suggesting the utility of jointly examining preferences and processes in the labor market."

0,"How do congregations from a white ethnic denomination respond to growing urban diversity? Using an ecological perspective, we examine 14 Christian Reformed congregations in Southeast Grand Rapids, Michigan over a 30-year time period (1970 to 2000). We track neighborhood composition, residential patterns of congregation members, and congregation membership totals. As white residents declined in urban neighborhoods, congregations from this historically Dutch denomination had difficulty sustaining themselves as neighborhood churches. Tracing the history of these congregations revealed churches reaching beyond their neighborhoods for members as the surroundings changed. Such activities resulted in niche overlap, heightened competition, and jeopardized organizational sustainability. Older, more traditional churches in the most dramatically changing neighborhoods saw membership plummet. Newer, more suburban congregations showed greater stability. Fastest growing were mission churches originally formed to serve non-Dutch constituencies but now attracting diverse members from a wide area. Implementing organizational ecology theory, our conclusions address issues of adaptation, institutional interrelationships, and the contingent nature of competitive advantage."
0,"One path to cultural innovation in artistic and literary fields is differentiation of a genre into new subgenres. But what are the dynamics at work in such a process? This article addresses that question by identifying and explaining the emergence and trajectory of a new fiction subgenre-the American labor problem novel-during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. I make a theoretical case for the intersection of social movement fields and cultural production fields showing, through a historical sociological analysis, that this subgenre was the joint product of: (1) a shift in literary aesthetic practice resulting from the rise of realism, (2) the subgenre dialogical character (3) collective contention surrounding the rise of labor movement militancy, and (4) the exigencies of literary and popular culture markets. The historical conjuncture of these processes contributed to a repository of cultural constructions of class in storied form, as novelists sought to both entertain and educate readers about the emerging realities of class-contentious industrial society. This study demonstrates the fruitfulness of merging sociology of culture theory and social movement outcome perspectives when analyzing cultural change."
0,"Public rituals often come into existence in response to uncertainty in social order. They redraw the boundaries between insiders and outsiders and reaffirm group membership. The very process of public rituals, however, is in itself a liminal moment which creates uncertainty. In a successful public ritual both types of uncertainty have to be controlled. This is accomplished through a different type of ritual, a security ritual, which operates in public and behind the scenes and is integral to the ritual process and form."
0,"Utilizing a life course framework and a nationally representative sample of men drawn from the first wave of the National Survey of Families and Households, this study examines the effects of paternal involvement on fathers well-being. Well-being is assessed by multiple dimensions of psychological and physical health, including overall happiness, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and self-assessed health. Although the multiple dimensions of paternal involvement (availability, engagement, and affection) have differing effects on some outcomes, involved fathering is generally positively related to mens well-being. A number of life course factors moderate the relationship between fatherhood and depressive symptoms, but a majority of aspects of the well-being are not conditioned by characteristics of fathers or their families, suggesting that fatherhood is a universal experience that affects men in a similar way across a variety of life course and social positions."
0,"A long line of research shows that health habits, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, are linked to lower rates of morbidity and mortality. Because of this link, public health campaigns diligently work to educate people on how to live healthy lifestyles. Yet, individuals do not make choices about food and exercise in a vacuum. Intimate partners—particularly wives—have been shown to shape these health habits in important ways. The present study utilizes 122 in-depth interviews with 60 gay, lesbian, and straight long-term couples to examine how intimate partners manage one another’s eating and exercise habits across the life course—dynamics conceptualized as part of the larger concept “health work.” Findings reveal that in straight couples health work is gender bifurcated: women do health work around eating, and men health work around exercise. No clear gender theme emerged in gay and lesbian couples. Further, nearly all gay and lesbian couples, but only two straight couples, emphasize health work as mutually reinforcing “we” work. Taken together, these dynamics suggests that health work varies by not only gender but also participation in marriage, sexual identity, and type of health behavior across the life course. Understanding the ways in which partners attempt to influence the health of one another through health work can inform gender, health, and family research, as well as policy makers who aim to facilitate public health initiatives."
0,"Southfield, Michigan is experiencing damage to its image and its social milieu due to White flight.  White flight increases the segregation in the city.  The purpose of this study is to explore how and why White flight occurs.  One reason why White flight occurs is the perception of structural strength.  Dr. Richard Taub of University of Chicago used this term, and it measures resgregation in a given city.  It has three components: crime, property value, and educational value.  Most white flighters are motivated to move due to their perception that Black people will increase crime, decrease property values, and decrease the value of an education in Southfield.  To increase the structural strength of Southfield, the school board, churches, and all of the neighborhood associations need to work together to promote and create diversity."
0,"The expansion of the U. S. penal system has important consequences for poverty and inequality, yet little is known about the imposition of monetary sanctions. This study analyzes national and state-level court data to assess their imposition and interview data to identify their social and legal consequences. Findings indicate that monetary sanctions are imposed on a substantial majority of the millions of people convicted of crimes in the United States annually and that legal debt is substantial relative to expected earnings. This indebtedness reproduces disadvantage by reducing family income, by limiting access to opportunities and resources, and by increasing the likelihood of ongoing criminal justice involvement."
0,"Accountability is the global language of regulation and evaluation.  Although its meaning varies, accountability is now a master frame that synthesizes and expresses a complex of relations and concerns. Its presence suggests rectitude, democracy, efficiency; its absence, corruption, secrecy, waste. Being held accountable is a relationship imposed on more people doing different things in a broad range of organizations. While no serious person disputes the importance of accountability, of holding people and organizations responsible for their actions, scholars often fail to investigate its effects empirically. This neglect is important because the stakes of accountability are high and variable. Efforts to enact accountability absorb immense resources; standards devised in one context often generate different outcomes in other contexts; and procedures for accountability are mediated by local practices. Healthcare is one vast, contested site of accountability. Creating measures to hold healthcare providers accountable produces unwanted, unintended side effects. Just the balance between the benefits and side effects of drugs must be carefully considered, so too must the benefits and side effects of accountability. Too often, especially in relations of dependence, accountability has been imposed by outsiders without examining its sometimes self-defeating effects. We contribute to knowledge of the stakes of accountability by analyzing its meaning and effects in one important context, the treatment of HIV/AIDS. We document three significant side effects of accountability: changes in patterns of attention, the proliferation of positions devoted to accountability and the bureaucratic personalities that these positions sometime encourage, and changes in linkages between groups and organizations."
0,"Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality, laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality. Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

0,"Abstract: This paper presents a mixed method strategy for studying local, national and transnational inter-organizational networks between community-based AIDS organizations (CBOs) in Mexico.  The first phase of the project entails using qualitative methods (in-depth interviews, participant observation and archival document analysis) in order to examine how and to what effect local organizations strategically engage in transnational collaboration to resolve local problems.  The second phase of the project employs a social network analysis using UCINET software to systematically measure the effect of networks on organizational outcomes. Previous research (Barnes 2002; Fox 2002; Bandy 2004; Barnes forthcoming) has shown that certain types of transnational networks have paradoxical effects for local CBOs and the AIDS service sector.  The dilemma is that transnational networks convey much-needed resources to facilitate the work of local organizations, while simultaneously exacerbating or creating competitive divisions between local CBOs.  These divisions significantly compromise organizational sustainability and service provision capacity at the local level.  The combining of qualitative and quantitative methods and data allows for triangulation and verification of the data in order to data widen and enrich understanding of how inter-organizational networks function, and to generate realistic health policy and practice recommendations for coordinating AIDS services in transnational settings."
0,"Rising economic disparities in the United States at the end of the twentieth century make understanding the severity and determinants of residential segregation between the affluent and poor increasingly important. Existing studies are limited, however, by little attention to the spatial configuration of class segregation. Segregation occurs along multiple spatial dimensions-the affluent and poor may be split not only between different neighborhoods, but concentrated over more or less land, more or less centralized, and clustered near or far from other similar neighborhoods. Each dimension affects the amount of contact and shared resources between groups differently, and overlaps between them produce particularly severe social isolation. Theories conflict over the spatial form of class segregation, with the concentric zone model expecting the affluent to be clustered in large-lot developments on the metropolitan fringe and critics proposing alternative spatial forms in a more patchwork pattern. I use U.S. Census summary data for all metropolitan areas in 2000 to test competing theories of the patterns and determinants of the spatial form of affluent-poor segregation using cluster and regression analysis. l identify two dominant spatial forms of affluent-poor segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000, and find that racial diversity and segregation are key determinants of which spatial form characterizes a metropolitan area. The links between poverty, prosperity, and place were therefore crucially shaped by race as well as economic disparities in the age of extremes."
0,"This paper discusses the effects of gentrification on small businesses in a predominantly Mexican and Mexican-American neighborhood of Chicago. Drawing on 25 interviews conducted over the course of one year, I address the following questions: How do locally-owned small businesses adapt to or resist gentrification?  What strategies do small business owners employ in order to remain in business alongside demographic changes? My findings show that small businesses play an integral role in neighborhood change and are often times affected by gentrification in both negative and positive ways.  At the same time new higher income residents provide small business owners with opportunities to capitalize on the changing neighborhood.  Instead of allowing increased land prices and a change in customers to control the outcome of their businesses, my findings show that many small business owners adapted their products, services, and prices to attract a variety of customers.  There were, however, also a handful of small business owners who did not adapt or whose strategies did not effectively attract customers."
0,"This study investigates the effect of segregationist murders, in conjunction with black protest, on federal passage of black voting-rights policies. Using time-series regression techniques, I find that white violence diminished federal responsiveness to black protest from the '30s through the end of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. But by President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration and the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, violence stimulated government response to black protest. I argue that the historically contingent nature of the violence effect is attributable to the changing nature Of the audience. Segregationist violence seems to have helped the movement win Southern suffrage only when the audience was attentive, sympathetic and involved in the policy conflict."
0,"Migrants form nonfamilial ties in urban destinations, which could compete with origin families for a share of remittances. A framework of competing commitment predicts that new relationships affect remittances depending on the extent to which they substitute for the benefits provided by origin families. Analyses of data from urban migrants in Kenya show that serious nonmarital sexual partners substitute for psychosocial support from the rural family and that material transfers migrants give to these partners significantly reduce remittances. The findings have implications for the ways scholars conceive of competition, the nature of exchange, and substitution of support across intimate relationships."
0,"Poverty and inequality in Turkey deepened even further after 1980 in the production process as a result of labor and capital reformation and the repeating crises caused by the implementation of the new liberal policies supporting this new structure. Poverty in Turkey was discussed as a structural problem within the framework of the issue of underdevelopment after 1950. The elimination of poverty and the thought that poverty will be resolved within the framework of economic growth and development has endured as a common tendency up to the present time. The negative impact of the crises created by the process of reformation on the social classes and the decline in the quality of life led to an increase in the interest in the topic of post-1990 poverty in Turkey, leading to a growth in the volume of research in this area. Nevertheless, the studies looking into the effects of the crises on women becoming poor and the relationship between women and poverty from a gender perspective are rather limited. The main aim of this paper is to discuss critically poverty literature in terms of their gender-blind nature in Turkey."
0,"Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory expectations regarding the relationship between status and the relative experience of anger, with some predicting a negative relationship and others proposing a positive one. We test the compatibility of these opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We connect different strands of theory and research in the social psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship."
0,"A significant other or an enemy is often an indispensable factor in constituting nationalism or national identity among a specific group of people. Since the independence from the colonial rule by Japan in 1945 and the Korean War 1950-1953, South Koreans have had two such significant others: North Korean communists and Japanese colonialists. Due to the fact that Japan has been an important anti-communist ally for South Korea, there has been acute contradiction between the two main components of pop South Korean nationalism: anti-North Korean and anti-Japanese sentiments. This paper studies how those two mutually contradicting components are influenced by social class, education and other demographic factors."
0,"The all-women roller derby revival has grown rapidly from one league in 2001 to over 300 leagues today.  In this paper I argue that theoretical work produced by social movement scholars can fruitfully be applied to an analysis of the roller derby revival.  Roller derby participants do not use traditional protest tactics and they are not striving for political change or a redistribution of material resources; however, based on an ethnographic study of three roller derby leagues, I argue that roller derby can be seen as a social movement that challenges cultural codes.  In other words, the roller derby revival is an example of a “new social movement.”  Roller derby participants build community and create collective identities through their involvement in the sport, are guided by a do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos based on resisting corporate control of their organizations, and challenge gender norms and stereotypes about women.  Rollergirls experience personal transformation through their participation; yet many also seek social change through their involvement in this “new” social movement."
0,"Emergent economies suffer from underdeveloped market infrastructures and insufficient public institutions to enforce contract commitments and property rights. Informal reputation-based arrangements may substitute for government enforcement, but they require close-knit networks that enable monitoring. Economic development also requires access to capital, information, and other resources, which is enabled by wide-reaching and diverse networks and not by closure. How is entrepreneurship possible given these conflicting demands? In this article, the authors examine how partnership networks and reputation channel the mobilization of capital for new enterprises, using quantitative information on 4,172 corporate partnerships during the industrialization of late imperial Russia (1869-1913). They find that reputation is locally effective in small and homogeneous network components. By contrast, founders in the largest components that form the network core raise more capital from investors but benefit less from reputation and more from brokerage opportunities and ties that reach diverse communities."
0,"Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genome scans were introduced to the market in 1997.  Since then an estimated 80,000 consumers have sent off saliva samples and a hefty fee to learn about their unique genomic profiles, including their ‘statistical propensity’ for developing certain diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes), as well their likelihood to respond to certain drug therapies (e.g. ability to metabolize statins).  While the market has been slow to take off, the introduction of DTC genomic scans has granted consumers unprecedented access to health related information heretofore under the sole jurisdiction of the medical profession, specifically the physician.  While the body of literature assessing DTC genome scan efficacy, clinical utility and ethical concerns continues to burgeon, little research has considered how consumer uptake of these molecular technologies could influence patient/physician roles, and accordingly, the degree of professional dominance and authority enjoyed by the medical profession."
0,"In contrast to recent US studies showing a decrease in core network size, our Kenyan data reveals substantial network growth. We attribute this to the diffusion of mobile telephones. Results from pooled survey data from Nairobi professionals and entrepreneurs in 2002 and 2007 as well as qualitative interviews from 2007 to 2009 show virtual saturation in the diffusion of phones during this period, but no direct effect of technology use. What explains this puzzle is a network effect of mobile telephony: increased technological access to existing networks in a context of resource scarcity leads to a strengthening of weak ties and the enhancement of core networks among Kenyans. Video ethnographic data before and after the 2007 post-election unrest supports this interpretation, showing that mobile phones are a crucial resource in managing interpersonal networks for instrumental purposes.

0,"Late twentieth century censuses have been interpreted alternatively as impositions of state authority or outcomes of historically new social influences in the form of social movements. We do not deny state or social influence on censuses, but we show that these two particular views of state and social influence are too narrow. States were quite limited in their ability to impose censuses on their populations. Social movements were undoubtedly important, but their appearance was historically contingent. We showed this here is three ways by comparing contemporary censuses in the US, Britain, and Italy. First, the historical pattern of information gathering, not solely states’ demands, were important. Second, highly instrumental censuses that provided usable data to the government, social groups, businesses, and academics developed where there was intense interaction between social groups and different pieces of the state, such as the legislature, local government groups, and the census agencies. Third, the rise of social movements depended on these first two patterns; namely that the census had been historically institutionalized in such a way to involve many parties over a long period of time. Thus, censuses in the US tended to be highly controversial and subject to lobbying by many parties, while censuses in Italy generally provoked little controversy. Britain formed an intermediate case."
0,"Quantitative research on fathers’ engagement has either relied on a single measure of quantity or has focused upon individual activities in isolation.  In this exploratory paper, I propose an alternative approach that categorizes fathers based on the patterns of activities they share with their children.  A cluster analysis of time diary data is used to identify six types of resident fathers in wave two of the CDS, a nationally-representative sample (N=696): low engagement, enrichment, couch potato, social/church, household, and companion.  I also estimate the multivariate associations between cluster membership and economic, cultural, and demographic measures.  I conclude by discussing the potential uses of a typological approach for studying fathers in diverse social contexts and understanding fathers’ role in child development."
0,"This article builds on examinations of whiteness in organizations by considering how white normativity - or the often unconscious and invisible ideas and practices that make whiteness appear natural and right - is sustained even in organizations that are attentive to structural factors. Based on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, this article critically examines the racial identity and culture of the Center, a Los Angeles lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organization with a national reputation for multiculturalism, a visible presence of people of color in leadership, and a staff of more than 50 percent people of color. Despite these indicators of racial diversity, the organization also maintained a local reputation among queer people of color as the white LGBT organization in Los Angeles. The author demonstrates that the Center's formal and public attempts to build and proclaim a racially diverse collective identity, along with its reliance on mainstream diversity frames available in the broader environment, became the very practices that employees of color identified as evidence of the white normative culture of the organization."
0,"The main purpose of this study is to get a comprehensive understanding of the impact of school and class context on individuals self-esteem and academic achievement. Two effects are considered with a SEM research model including others performance on an individuals self-esteem, the contrast and assimilation effect, and different influences from reference groups. The analysis shows that friendship network within a class has a negative effect on an individuals self-esteem while having a positive effect on a students academic achievement. The effects of classmates on an individuals self-esteem are both contrast and assimilation. Students will be proud to own an outstanding friend but will feel stressful with that particular outstanding friend.  Besides, class and school effect didnt significantly make an impact on students self-esteem. The study concluded that friends within a class that an individual nominated have the most significant influence on students self esteem and academic achievement, though the outcomes are oppositely."
0,"Little is known about how marital sexual interaction influences eventual marital disruption, despite research in various disciplines examining the sex lives of the married. This relatively unexplored area compels sociological inquiry, since most Americans will marry, yet nearly half of all American marriages are expected to end in divorce. Surprisingly, no one has posed the question: does frequent, satisfying, and/or agreeable marital sexual interaction early in marriage help to sustain a marriage? With panel data from the Marriage Matters Panel Survey of Newlywed Couples, 1998-2004, I utilize these three indicators (frequency, satisfaction, and agreement) to assess this question. The results provide evidence that the influence of marital sexuality on marital disruption is limited. However, interesting gender nuances appear and indicate that husband's satisfaction with physical intimacy early in marriage has a consistent positive effect on whether or not the couple will experience a marital disruption.

0,"Disaster studies have made important progress in recognizing the unequally distributed consequences of disasters, but there has been less progress in analyzing social factors that help create ""natural"" disasters. Even well-known patterns of hazard-creation tend to be interpreted generically - as representing ""economic development"" or ""capitalism"" - rather than through focusing on the more specific dynamics involved. We illustrate this point with two recent and well-known cases of flooding - those in the tipper Mississippi River Valley and in the Katrina-related devastation of New Orleans. In the former case, damage was caused in part by building the very kinds of higher and stronger floodwalls that were shown to be inadequate in the latter. In the New Orleans case, a more important factor in the death and destruction was the excavation of a transportation canal. fit both cases, and many more, the underlying causes of damage to humans as well as to the environment has involved a three-part pattern, supported by the political system - spreading the costs, concentrating the economic benefits and hiding the real risks. In very real senses, these have been floods of folly, created not just by extreme weather events, but by deadly and avoidable patterns of political-economic choices. Comparable patterns appear to deserve greater attention in other contexts, as well."
0,"The migration of Latinos to nontraditional settlement areas in the United States is renewing interest in how an established low-skilled work force is affected by the inflow of a minority group whose members tend to have a weak basket of human capital. Some scholars focus on how the incoming group creates head-to-head competition with established workers. An alternative view posits that, depending on the context of the receiving labor market, incoming workers may primarily fill roles that complement preexisting labor market arrangements. I study these issues in the region of the country that has experienced the most pronounced in-migration of Latinos during the past few years. The findings indicate migrating Latinos tend to complement preexisting labor market conditions rather than spark job competition and undercut the earning power of non-Latinos. "
0,"Using a sample of 6444 decedents aged 80 from the first three waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, the present study examine how individuals characteristics, availability and accessibility of formal and informal care sources, and community development affect the place of death. Our results show that these factors are highly correlated with place of death which is line with prior studies. However, the pattern of place of death is entirely different between China, a developing country, and developed nations. Nearly 90% of decedents in our sample die at home, whereas hospital death is high in western societies although there is increased trend in home death due to development in hospice care and home health care. We, therefore, propose a three-stage evolution hypothesis of place of death trying to explain the difference in place of death in different stage and different effect of individual characteristics on place of death across studies."

What are the benefits of coalition building and how may coalitions enhance movement success and community social capital? Findings indicate that activists view coalitions positively and that coalitions exist in three primary forms. Costs of coalition building are associated with a labor-intensive education and outreach framework entailing significant personal communication, networking, and trust building. Benefits of coalition building include an enhanced understanding of local and community experiences, an opportunity to share resources, and a stronger voice to hold power accountable. Local-EJ coalition efforts maintain attributes useful in building community social capital."
0,"Recently, social movement scholars have taken increasing interest in the institutionalization of social movements, particularly the effects of institutionalization in mainstreaming protest activity.  This paper contributes to this emerging body of literature by examining the logic, conditions, and responses to institutionalization in the contemporary student movement. Conclusions based on a case study of a contemporary student movement organization emphasize the ways in which student movements are influenced by the policies established by the university administration.  However, while institutionalization has shaped the student movement, student groups may still fall short of allowing their movements to be co-opted by administrators, waging in direct action against the university as a means of fighting institutional co-optation."
0,"Most scholars think state administrations vary because rulers attempt to maximize resource extraction given pressure from interstate competition and as constrained by the social structure of the societies they govern. This perspective cannot account for variations in British colonial tax administration in India, circa 1770 to 1855. The British organized land revenue collection and administration as a whole through two different schemes. Both systems initially adopted a rhetoric of revenue maximization, but neither was decisively better matched to Indian social structure. Instead, administrators interpreted a seemingly opaque Indian society by understanding themselves as fundamentally similar to or different from Indians."
0,"Using data on couples in 34 countries in the 2002 International Social Survey Program, this paper demonstrates that there is a near universal principal of hierarchy in male task avoidance for a set of female-typed household chores.  Based on Mokken scaling, countries are shown to differ in the degree to which they have a strictly ordered task hierarchy of male avoidance, as opposed to a looser schema that permits greater diversity in domestic gender relations.   Task-specific multi-level analyses point to differences in some predictors of tasks which are more readily accepted and those more generally avoided."
0,"This article uses the Hapa movement as a case study in order to provide a framework for understanding identity as a goal of social movements and to expand on a theoretical understanding of multiracial social movements. In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono) racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial ""Hapa"" identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists' understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono) racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity. Activism by mixed-race individuals and organizations constitutes an important challenge to power that has significant implications for racial categorization and classification in contemporary American society."
0,"This paper considers how the prospects for a global civil society are related to the development of global media. More specifically, we wish to examine the hegemony of the American media industry, and the effect that American television has on global publics and global citizens. Our goal is to move beyond the cultural imperialism thesis, by introducing the twin concepts of global public sphere and cultural citizenship. Examining news as well as entertainment media, we consider the extent to which American television serves as a vehicle for social reflexivity in the aesthetic publics of other countries. We also consider the limited and uneven nature of this reflexivity, as a different way of thinking about the issue of power and ideology."
0,"Research examining the effects of welfare dynamics on children's development has provided little information to date on the experiences of immigrant children. Using longitudinal data collected during the period of welfare reform (1995-1999; the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. PHDCN), this study investigates whether welfare leaving is associated with changes in preschool-aged children's (n = 550) physical health (i.e., general health status, sick days, respiratory illness and emergency room visits) over time, and whether these associations differ by parents' nativity status. We find that children of immigrant welfare leavers fare significantly worse in terms of their health than their peers in either native leaver families, or immigrant families who continued to receive assistance. Associations are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of control variables including children's initial health status, family demographic characteristics, qualities of the home environment, and indicators of parents' physical and mental health. Negative impacts of welfare leaving on children's health appear to be concentrated among immigrants who have multiple ""barriers"" to program participation (i.e., limited English proficiency. fewer years residing in the US, households with no citizen parent, and self-reported experiences of discrimination).

0,"In this paper we develop a political capital theory that goes beyond exchange theory and resource dependence approaches to power in organizations.  At the socio-behavioral level we identify three analytically distinct sources of power in social interactions: relative dependence, social status, and identification. We view political capital as the varied set of resources available to individuals in organizational settings to influence the actions and ideas of others, despite resistance. We develop a typology of sources of political capital: human, social, symbolic, reputational, economic, organizational, and cultural, and explore the social and behavioral mechanism by which these resources affect others. These social resources are subject to accumulation, leverage, depletion, and depreciation, as individual engage in social interactions in organizations. We examine how these various forms of political capital affect relative dependence, social status, and identification. Relying on both macro (Bourdieu) and micro (Lewin) field theory perspectives, we posit that the value of the sources of political capital is shaped by the cultural and economic processes in the organization and organizational field.  Power at the level of social interactions is a result of the activation and deployment of the various sources of political capital in social interactions."
0,"Dealing with personnel inherited from prior regimes in the administration of transitional states is critical for democratic consolidation, a problem traditionally addressed by the dichotomy of continuation or dismissal. However, major organizational innovations to deal with tainted officials appear in postcommunist Central Europe. Using the concept of lustration systems, this study differentiates three archetypes: dismissal, exposure, and confession. The authors propose that each system carries different symbolic meanings, which produce different outcomes for citizens' trust in government and in tainted officials. The hypothesized effects of different lustration systems on trust are tested by an experiment embedded in nationwide representative surveys conducted in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. The results show that dismissal and confession increase citizens' trust in government and trust in tainted officials. However, exposure reduces citizens' trust in tainted officials."
0,"It is unclear whether the American educational system yields the same rewards to immigrant youth and their children as to native-born individuals. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS: 88), I apply human capital theory, assimilation theory and social capital theory to exam whether Asian and Hispanic immigrant youth who arrived as children or adolescents post 1965 and the children of recent immigrants achieve the same economic returns to an education as whites in the United States.  The findings of the study indicate that there are substantial subgroup differences in economic return on education. While there are no difference between Filipino, Korean, Southeast Asian, Puerto Rican and White, Chinese earn more and Mexican earn less than White. A four-year college or above degree are especially beneficially for Chinese, Korean, and Mexican. Consistent with the literature indicating that second generation youth are more successful, I find that second generation youth achieve much higher earnings than third and above generations. Parental involvement in learning shows no independent direct effects on childrens future earnings.  Overall attending private high school promotes future earnings, but Chinese who attended public schools do not earn less."
0,"Weber and Foucault provided an influential view of the development of European war during the state-building phase of the eighteenth century in which the conduct of war was completely rationalized.  Both considered this an integral part not only of state-building, but of the formation of the modern citizen as a subject, rationalized and disciplined.   Instead of the charismatic war heroes who fought in an irrational state of ecstasy, soldiers fought only because they were disciplined to unthinkingly obey any order in a state of cool efficiency.  Closer attention shows that not only there is a difference between the objective rationalization of war and its subjective rationality for soldiers, but historically the two tend to be inversely correlated.  What both Weber and Foucault took to be part of a general trend towards a modern rationalization of war was instead part of a historically recurring process whereby expanding infantry-based armies attempt to compensate for the subjective irrationality of military action by embedding soldiers in objectively rational structures.  Far from this being a key component of the modern state and its subjects, this approach to war was rapidly becoming obsolete in the nineteenth century, as changes in both weaponry and polity made it possible to relax objective rationalization and rely on the subjective rationality of soldiers."
0,"Growing racial diversity in the United States coupled with changing cultural norms toward interracial dating has produced more interracial couples (Root 2001). Past research on interracial dating is largely concerned with adult dating behavior and has focused on investigating the linkages between racial attitudes and the propensity to date interracially. In the larger dating literature, researchers have documented the role of body type preferences as a contributing factor to relationship formation but the role of body type preferences has garnered little attention in interracial dating literature. Furthermore, adolescents maturing in this more accepting society have started to date interracially as well and little research has focused on the factors that influence interracial dating for adolescents. This paper examines the factors that influence interracial adolescent dating, specifically the link between an adolescent’s body type as measured by Body Mass Index (henceforth “BMI”) and the likelihood of that individual entering an interracial relationship. I predict that white adolescent girls with levels of BMI that align with the body type preferences of minority men will enter into interracial relationships at higher rates than their peers with levels of BMI that are not consistent with minority male preferences. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I estimate the effects of BMI on the likelihood of an individual entering an interracial relationship through binomial logistic regression analysis. I find that for white female adolescents, as BMI increases the likelihood of being involved in an interracial relationship increases."
0,"The overall purpose of this paper is to provide some sociological insights and understandings of the current system of Institutional Review Boards, why it is frustrating to work with them, and why the human research protections system is relatively unresponsive to calls for it to become more effective and user friendly.  A sociological perspective requires that we shift from the individual focus on morals and virtues held by philosophers and ethicists to ask how individuals come to hold these values or carry out moral and ethical behaviors.  Social mores are conscious attempts to control behavior and usually require mechanisms to prevent and stop certain activities or practices.  This paper will argue that human research protections are a form of social mores operating under what Weber termed substantive rather than formal rationality.  IRBs are hybrid entities established by the federal government to ensure the integrity and ethics of government funded research, but are based in the non governmental sector of universities and hospitals.  While the law and federal regulations might not recognize the specific harms to participants in human research directly, the granting of police powers and enforcement to IRBs gives them quasi legal authority.  If this provides a clearly understanding of the nature and authority of IRBs then it may be possible to improve and rationalize the system."
0,"Survey data collected from a southwestern metropolitan area indicate that self-defined politically conservative individuals are less inclined to commit criminal or deviant acts than their liberal or moderate counterparts; however, results from multivariate analyses indicate that measures of self-control and pressure to conform all reduce the effects of political conservatism to nonsignificance. In general, the relationship between political ideology and misbehavior appears to be partly spurious and partly indirectly attributable to the effects of other social and situational factors. Moreover, responsiveness to pressures to conform is not due to self-control. The results provide some challenge to traditional interpretations of misbehavior but they also confirm an important part played by structural/contextual variables."
0,"This paper concerns environmental inequality and Appalachian regional marginalization.  I argue that environmental racism and Appalachian marginalization are related; the marked whiteness of the white Appalachian poor is an example of the racial logic of Othering that is important in the construction of notions of white middle-class identity.  Environmental degradation and economic exploitation are understood to happen to Other people, and therefore seem not to directly effect the lives of white middle-class Americans.  The paper analyses the representation of coalfield poverty in Coal Hollow, a book of photographs and oral histories by Ken and Melanie Light, published by the University of California Press in 2006.  Coal Hollow attempts to draw attention to the plight of people in the coalfields of Appalachia, but because of the way it repeats themes of Appalachian difference, the authors do not trouble the common-sense notions that relegate Appalachian poverty and environmental problems to a different category of experience than the everyday life of normal Americans.  This common-sense construction of the Otherness of the Appalachian poor, like the so-called Third World to whom they are often compared, has the effect of creating an illusion of white middle-class safety."
0,"By investigating the intergenerational consequences of multiple aspects of family experiences across the life course this paper advances what we know about the forces shaping children's initiation of sexual and contraceptive behaviors. Our aim is to advance the scientific understanding of early sexual experiences by explicitly considering contraceptive use and by differentiating between the consequences of parental family experiences during Childhood and those during adolescence and young adulthood. Thanks to unique, highly detailed data measuring parental family experiences throughout the life course and sexual dynamics early in life it is possible to provide detailed empirical estimates of the relationship between parental family experiences and contraceptive use at first sex a relationship about which we know relatively little. Findings reveal (1) significant simultaneous consequences of many different dimensions of parental family experiences for the timing of first sex and the likelihood of using contraception at first sex, but the specific dimensions of family important for the specific behavior vary across racial groups: and (2) that parental family experiences influence the timing of sex and contraceptive use differently.

0,"Increasingly, scholars have come to see the news media as playing a pivotal role in shaping whether social movements are able to bring about broader social change. By drawing attention to movements' issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers' focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media."
0,"This paper examines the overtime effects of participation in extracurricular activities on adolescent self-esteem using data from National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AdHealth) . Existing research suggests that participation in extracurricular activities, such as organizations, clubs, and sports, are tied to positive development in adolescent youth. However many of these studies infer causal impacts using cross-sectional data and most fail to take into account other factors which may lead to spurious effects, including parental involvement, social acceptance, and exercise. The findings in this study are consistent with previous research in the fact that participation in after school/extracurricular activities increases adolescent self-esteem overtime, net of self-esteem at baseline. Other findings indicate that the type of activity affects the impact on self-esteem and that only highly active teens experience these benefits. Furthermore, gender and ethnicity/minority status also affect both participation in extracurricular activities and the influence of these activities on self-esteem.  Impacts of extracurricular activity on self esteem do not appear to be explained by the physiological effects of exercise or of increased social acceptance."
0,"The relevance of family income for religious participation in the United States has been largely ignored in recent decades. Addressing this neglect, we focus our attention primarily upon white Catholics, the poorer of whom we reason have fewer options to participate in the context of an increasingly middle-class Church. Analyzing the 1972-2006 cumulative General Social Survey data, we show that net of all other factors low-income white Catholics attend church less often than other white Catholics, although social integration mechanisms significantly moderate the effects of income. Additional analyses suggest that the effects of income on church attendance are greatest for the younger white Catholic cohort. In contrast, the role of income in Latino Catholics' attendance is relatively weak. In our conclusion, we attempt to integrate our most puzzling finding - having children in the home does not increase the church attendance of low-income white Catholics - with our main theoretical line of argument concerning the central role of social integration in understanding the impact of income on religious participation."
0,"Despite widespread perceptions that the American labor movement is a male-dominated institution, there is considerable evidence women play an important role in many working class struggles.  Recently scholars have begun to recognize that the growth of social movement unionism, which began in the 1990s, has created new leadership opportunities for women.  Yet analyses of womens representation in political institutions have identified a host of structural and cultural factors that may also shape womens ability to achieve electoral power in these organizations.  The findings, based on a sample of 70 local unions, indicate that explanations offered by those interested in women and politics translate quite well to social movements.  This research provides important insight into the role of women in organized labor today as well as the interplay of gender and power in formal organizations more broadly."
0,"This study utilizes discourse theory to examine how the stigmatizing discursive practices of people outside of burlesque contribute to the reproduction of mainstream feminine ideology within this troupe’s neo-burlesque performances.  Additionally, this study examines the only four non-white members of the troupe and how their racial and ethnic femininity is subtly incorporated within their performances despite the vocalized expectations of others, and the consequences of this.  This study utilized interviews with 23 members of a neo-burlesque troupe and participant-observation fieldnotes to find, that in response to outsiders’ discursive stigma assignment, the troupe, through their workshop and peer-review process, works to perpetuate mainstream ideas of femininity within their performances.  Feminine presentation is subtly negotiated by the minority troupe members through their use of racial stereotypes and cultural traditions in their performances; however, the femininity they present is still within the boundaries of mainstream ideology."
0,"The present paper examines the current state of the U.S. automotive industry, comparing the dichotomous strategies and developmental trajectories of U.S. firms (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) and foreign transplants (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru). First, we will examine change in the distribution of U.S. production and production facilities over time, demonstrating production growth among transplants, with brief mention of U.S. firms expansion into China. Second, we describe the implications of such production shifts for employment in the assembly and parts sectors, and in high-value sectors such as engineering and research. Finally, we discuss labor contracts, with specific attention to unionization, wages, job responsibilities, and benefits offerings. We conclude with implications for the American automotive industry and a brief discussion of current corporate strategy."
0,"This paper effects an environmental history of the early modern sugar ?commodity frontier? as a decisive moment in the ?Rise of the West? and the emergence of capitalism. If the object of explanation is the rise of capitalism, the implications of this analysis speak directly to mounting ecological challenges today. Above all the paper seeks to promote cross-fertilization between two important literatures on the global system, environmental sociology and world-historical sociology. Environmental sociologists have argued persuasively that ?human-exemptionalist? explanations falter insofar as they marginalize ecological relations. No less persuasively, historical sociologists have argued that we need a long-run perpsective to distinguish new from old in the era of globalization. This paper seeks a dynamic synthesis between the two, putting into play such concepts as metabolic rift and world-system in a study of the origins of modernity. Tracing the recurrent global extensions of sugar cultivation between 1450-1750 ? from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic islands to Brazil and thence the Caribbean ? I demonstrate that these early globalizations crystallized distinctively modern nature-society antagonisms. If historical sociologists have emphasized the endless accumulation of capital, and environmental sociologists the endless transformation of the earth, I show that by 1500 these two moments were mutually interdependent. This nature-society dialectic fueled and indeed necessitated capitalism?s global expansion over the longue duree. Whether or not capitalism as world-ecology can survive in the absence of external frontiers remains an open question; it is nonetheless one answered more effectively by combining the insights of environmental and historical sociology."
0,"Male sex workers serve multiple groups (i.e., gay-identified men, heterosexually-identified men, and their own sexual partners), making them a unique source to test theories of gender, masculinity, and sexuality. To date, most scholarship on this topic has been qualitative. I assembled a dataset from the largest online male sex worker website to conduct the first quantitative analysis of male escorts in the United States. I find the geographic distribution of male sex workers is more strongly correlated with the general population than with the gay male population. In addition, I estimate the value of sexual behaviors and personal characteristics in this market to test sociological theories of gender and masculinity. Consistent with hegemonic masculinity, I find that male escorts who advertise masculine behavior charge higher prices for their services, whereas escorts who advertise less masculine behavior charge significantly less, a differential on the order of 17 percent. Results show that race and sexual behavior interactions exert a strong influence on prices charged by male sex workers, confirming aspects of intersectionality theory."
0,"Using data made available by School of Americas Watch, we present a quantitative and longitudinal examination of the School of Americas (SOA), a United States training program for military officers from nations throughout the Western Hemisphere, and its relationship to extra-constitutional violence in Latin America from 1955 to 2001.While virtually all sociological theories would expect the United States to claim SOA reduces human rights abuses, nearly all sociological theories would take these claims with a grain of salt. Three theories -- rational choice institutionalism, world society, and geopolitical theory -- give us very different understandings of changing state-citizen relationships over broad time frames.  An emphasis on the utilitarian calculations of individual states, or the scripting of political action by global culture, makes it difficult to understand strategic actions  and when talking about human rights abuses, the culpability  of states in an era of globalization where states balance internal governance and international norms and conventions. We employ event history techniques to examine 1) factors contributing to spells of extra-constitutional violence, and 2) if SOA training and United States intervention contribute to the onset of violence. In sum, even as social scientists attend to and attempt to understand the tactical calculations of rational actors and the process of rationalization that occurs across long time horizons, it is important that social theory and research come to terms with the structured context and the culpability of states and hegemonic powers, when states resort to reliance on extra-constitutional violence."
0,"The welfare reform bill adopted in 1996 limited the eligibility of immigrants on federal funding for welfare use, while vesting states with the authority to create new state-funded substitute benefits for immigrants. This paper capitalizes on this inter-state variation in state welfare rules regarding new immigrants and estimates a triple difference-in-difference estimator that provides evidence on the impact of removing public assistance on Mexican immigrants' infant mortality rates. Using the US linked birth and infant death cohort files from 1995 to 1996 and from 1999 to 2002, I find that infant mortality rates have decreased at a slower rate among children of low-educated Mexican immigrant women compared to their native Mexican-origin counterparts, especially for those mothers residing in less affluent metropolitan counties within their own state. These findings suggest that there may be unintended social costs associated with the Personal Responsibility Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act, resulting in disparate impact on immigrant mothers and infants.

0,"Using ethnography and other qualitative methods, this paper examines a form of buying and selling that is growing quickly in the developing world and making a comeback in the United States.  In the last few decades, economic globalization has led to the expansion of direct selling organizations into the developing world, and to the founding of companies based on the U.S. direct sales model.  The cosmetics direct sales organization discussed here operates in Ecuador with a sales force that is officially comprised only of women.  As women and their clients come from a range of socioeconomic positions, sellers adjust their payment requirements to the financial realities of their customers, a practice that I call flexible consumption.  Deciding whether and how clients can pay over time is an individualized process that is determined by the social class positions and incomes of buyers and sellers, their relationships, and the social networks in which they are embedded.  Paying over time allows Ecuadorians of even the most humble backgrounds to afford products that are seen as valuable and prestigious, and helps sellers support their families.  This paper also considers direct selling in the context of expanding consumption in contemporary Ecuador, another effect of economic globalization.  The direct sales organization studied has combined a shrewd understanding of the cultural norms and material conditions in which sellers and buyers live in order to maintain profitability in a difficult economic climate."
0,"Much has been written about the 2006 pro-immigrant rights mobilizations in terms of the scale and scope, the role of the Spanish-speaking media, and the role of the Catholic Church.  Absent from this discourse is the role of Immigrant Rights Coalitions (IRCs).  The 2006 mobilizations and IRCs signaled something old and new in the Immigrant Rights Movement. IRCs are old in that they have been in place for many years but what was new in 2006 was there widespread appearance in organizing and mobilizing people throughout the country.  The author provides four case studies of IRC formation in 2006 to show that there is a strong relationship between the 2006 mobilizations and the formation of IRCs.  IRCs helped organize the 2006 mobilizations and the mobilizations helped boost the formation of new IRCs. In short, mobilizations and coalitions build off each other."
0,"This article explores whether mothers perceived control over their own workplace flexibility options has any relationship to their satisfaction with their husbands contributions to household labor in the United States. We hypothesize that flexibility enhances their ability to more adeptly engage in role management in multiple life areas, thus enabling them to be more satisfied with their partners domestic input as well. We use a unique data set of 1,078 randomly sampled women involved in mothers organizations that generally attract members based on their current level of participation in the paid labor market. We then link nine distinct workplace flexibility policies with mothers satisfaction related to their husbands participation in all household tasks, as well as a subset of female-typed tasks. We find that across both arrays of tasks, mothers with more perceived control over work-related schedule predictability and those that had the ability to secure employment again after an extended break had higher levels of satisfaction with their husbands participation in household labor. In addition, short-term time off to address unexpected needs was important for all tasks considered together only."
0,"Likelihood of marijuana-related police stop/search or arrest depends on many factors other than simply engaging in marijuana-related activity.  Police are assumed to suspect individuals of marijuana-related offenses based on several personal characteristics, including ethnicity, age, gender, age, educational level, and subculture.  An individuals likelihood of marijuana-related police contact is hypothesized to depend on how strongly this suspicion, the police gaze, falls on them, independently of their actual participation in public marijuana use.  A diverse, street-recruited, purposive sample of 462 marijuana users in New York City completed questionnaires for this study.  Several factors, including racial minority status, neighborhood in which the participant was recruited, gender, unemployed/non-student status, youth, and lower educational level were found to be simultaneously and independently related to likelihood of marijuana-related police contact even controlling for frequency of use, public use, and observance of etiquette intended to make the behavior less of a nuisance.  Etiquette was found, moreover, to be differentially effective based on race, location, and gender: Predicted probability of marijuana-related police contact was roughly 50% for African-Americans, males, and users recruited from Harlem or the South Bronx who observed none of the etiquettes and 10% or less if they followed all four.  By contrast, predicted probability of marijuana-related police contact for whites, females, and users recruited from non-poverty areas of Manhattan hovered around or below 10% regardless of etiquette observance.  The odds of marijuana-related police contact for Latinos were more than three times the odds for whites.  Results bear out that centrality to the police gaze dramatically influences an individuals likelihood of marijuana-related police stop/search and arrest independently of whether they engaged in any marijuana-related illegal behavior."
0,"In this paper, I argue that an intersectional feminist perspective on organizational dynamics helps to explain the trajectory of a social movement organization in the 1980s and 1990s, ACT UP/LA (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, Los Angeles).  While social movement scholars have privileged certain movements as being exemplars of generalizable social movements from which theory can be derived, I argue that movements and groups organized around sexual difference are relevant cases for theory, as they and all other movements are cross-cut by inequalities formed by social location.  In the case of ACT UP/LA, acknowledged gender divisions either led to conflicts within the group being read in a gendered way or to direct rivalry between women and men for group resources, despite the shared identity grounding of sexuality and a (mostly) shared agenda of anti-AIDS protest.   The case suggests that gender inequality, like other structural inequalities that shape social location, is relevant to understanding the trajectory of movement organization and movement’s themselves, whatever the agendas activists may explicitly advocate, and thus that a wider range of social movements should be considered as relevant for the making of general theory."
0,"The authors integrate social movement outcomes research and the world society approach to build a theoretical model to examine the impact of global and local factors on movement outcomes. Challenging the current research on policy change, which rarely examines the effects of global norms and local activism in one analysis, they argue (1) that global regimes empower and embolden local social movements and increase pressure on target governments from below, and (2) that local activists appeal to international forums with help from international activists to pressure the governments from above. When the pressures from the top and the bottom converge, social movements are more likely to succeed. Furthermore, these pressures are stronger in countries integrated into global society and on issues with strong global norms. The empirical analysis of social movements by resident Koreans in Japan advocating for four types of human rights - civil, political, social/economic, and cultural - demonstrates that the movements produced more successes as Japan's involvement in the international human rights regime expanded since the late 1970s, and that activism on issues with strong global norms achieved greater successes. The analysis also shows that lack of cohesive domestic activism can undercut the chances of social movements' success even with strong global norms on the issue."
0,"Segmented assimilation theory has been a popular explanation for the diverse experiences of assimilation among new waves of immigrants and their children. While the theory has been interpreted in many different ways, we emphasize its implications for the important role of social context: both processes and consequences of assimilation should depend on the local social context in which immigrants are embedded. We derive empirically falsifiable hypotheses about the interaction effects between social context and assimilation on immigrant children's well-being. We then test the hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our empirical analyses yield two main findings. First, for immigrant adolescents living in non-poverty neighborhoods, we find assimilation to be positively associated with educational achievement and psychological well-being but also positively associated with at-risk behavior. Second, there is little empirical evidence supporting our hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory. We interpret these results to mean that future research would be more fruitful focusing on differential processes of assimilation rather than differential consequences of assimilation. "
0,"Although pregnancy lossespecially miscarriageis a relatively common experience among reproductive-aged women, much of our understanding about the experience of pregnancy loss has come from small clinic-based or other non-representative samples. Furthermore, the various factors (individual, familial, economic, medical, cultural, and religious) that affect the psychological response to pregnancy loss are not well understood (Bennett et al., 2005). In this paper we compare general and fertility-specific distress among three groups of women: women who have experienced stillbirth, women who have experienced miscarriage, and women who have experienced neither loss. We use the National Study of Fertility Barriers (NSFB), a probability-based study of 4,712 American women of reproductive age. We demonstrate that women who have experienced stillbirths constitute a distinct, more distressed group, and we provide hope for women who have experienced loss that distress is likely to decrease over time and with the presence of other children. The multiple regression results provide an important step toward more nuanced studies of the psychological consequences of pregnancy loss. Our findings suggest the need for research on the psychological consequences of pregnancy loss to include type of loss as well as other fertility-related variables such as childlessness, subfecundity, recency of loss, and number of losses."
0,"In this paper we present and test a theoretical framework wherein compare the motivational configurations of individual as a function of perceived political opportunity structure and mobilizing structures. We studied two movements calling on for two collective actions against the same government at the same time and place. However, they emphasized other aspects of the proposed government policies. We show that instrumental motives are more important in the context of instrumental movements and that ideology motives are more important in the context of expressive movements. Moreover, the motivation of protesters who perceive the political opportunity structure as closed is fueled by frustration and anger whereas for protesters with an open perceived political opportunity structure this is indignation and anger. We conclude by stating that instead of viewing the paradigms as competing we see the more structural approaches political opportunity structure and mobilizing structure as complimentary to the more social-psychological approaches."
0,"This article reports findings from a recent survey of international migration from China's Fujian Province to the United States. Using the ethnosurvey approach developed in the Mexican Migration Project, the authors conducted surveys in migrant-sending communities in China as well as in destination communities in New York City. Hypotheses are derived from the international migration literature and the market transition debate. The results are generally consistent with hypotheses derived from cumulative causation of migration; however, geographical location creates some differences in migration patterns to the United States. In China as in Mexico, the existence of migration networks increases the propensity of migration for others in the community. In contrast to the Mexican case, among Chinese immigrants, having a previously migrated household member increases the propensity of other household members to migrate only after the debt for previous migration is paid off. In step with market transition theory, the authors also find that political power influences the migration experience from the coastal Fujian Province."

Using a nationally representative sample of roughly 1,200 public high schools, the relationship between school sports participation rates and in-school delinquent behaviors are examined. Results indicate that schools with higher proportions of sports participants report significantly fewer serious crimes (i.e., violent crimes) and suspensions occurring on school grounds. However, the incidence of minor crimes is unrelated to the proportion of students engaging in school sports. The results of this study support social control theory and suggest that one way to reduce violence and delinquency in schools is through encouraging participation in sports programs."
0,"Despite decades of scholarship on race and capital punishment, most research fails to:  focus on the most active death jurisdictions, consider the treatment of Hispanics, examine whether the race or socioeconomic status of the victim is the critical predictor of the defendants fate, or provide a plausible solution to the problem.  To address such limitations, I examined the impact of race on the District Attorneys (DA) decision to pursue a death trial and the jurors decision to impose a death sentence against adult defendants indicted for capital murder in Harris County (Houston), Texas from 1992 to 1999 (n=504).  The results indicate that the DA was more apt to pursue death trials against black defendants than white defendants.  The disparity stems from an intriguing pattern:  the DA pursued death trials against black defendants and white defendants at the same rate, but controlling for confounders revealed differential treatment because black defendant cases were less serious.  The DA was also more apt to pursue death trials on behalf of white victims and affluent victims, compared to black victims and non-affluent victims.  No differences were found between Hispanics and whites.  Because jurors sentenced defendants to death in an evenhanded manner, the race discrepancies that originated in the DAs office are duplicated in the final disposition of cases.  I draw on Donald Blacks (1989) concept of the desocialization of law to provide a realistic proposal for eliminating the impact of race on capital punishment."
0,"The authors propose that a trade-off between network diversity and communications bandwidth regulates access to novel information because a more diverse network structure increases novelty at a cost of reducing information flow. Received novelty then depends on whether (a) the information overlap is small enough, (b) alters' topical knowledge is shallow enough, and (c) alters' knowledge stocks refresh slowly enough to justify bridging structural holes. Social network and e-mail content from an executive recruiting firm show that bridging ties can actually offer less novelty for these reasons, suggesting that the strength of weak ties and structural holes depend on brokers' information environments."
0,"Historical sociologists have posited a relationship between the colonial era and later outcomes such as economic growth, political development, and incidence of warfare.  This paper continues this trend, but focuses on a different object of explanation:  independence-era racialization of former European settlement colonies.  Although all European settlement colonies fostered relations of dominance between European and non-European peoples based principally on settlers ability to exploit land and/or labor, the nation-states that emerged from this context were not uniformly racialized.  Some, like the United States and South Africa, became explicitly racialized polities based on the dominance of whites, while others, such as Cuba and Brazil, exhibited no formal racialization.  The existing literature seeking to explain this variation suffers from a number of shortcomings, including selection on the dependent variable and a failure to consider the empirical adequacy of the theory in relation to the full universe of cases.  Avoiding these flaws, this paper develops a two-fold proposition and demonstrates its empirical adequacy through a number of comparisons.  I argue that the development (or not) of explicitly racialized polities in the independence era was tied to the way in which relations between Europeans and non-Europeans were institutionalized during the colonial period.  In turn, this institutionalization was linked to the balance of power between the imperial power and European settlers.  Through empire-wide comparisons (British and Iberian) and comparisons among former British settlement colonies, this analysis demonstrates the relationship between high degrees of settler autonomy during the colonial era and the subsequent development of an explicitly racialized polity in the nation-state period."
0,"Past research indicates that black entrepreneurship in northern cities was unaffected by residential segregation by race until after the formation of the ""ghetto."" In the present study, however, an analysis of Census data shows that in the urban North during the late nineteenth century, the residential segregation of blacks was positively associated with blacks' shopkeeping ratio, a measure of the extent to which black retail entrepreneurs were merchants rather than peddlers. This finding accords with the theory that ethnic businesses are often supported by the residential segregation of group members. Moreover, it implies that black merchants in northern cities may have been bolstered by business ownership opportunities created by a socially and spatially segregated market of black consumers much earlier than previously believed."
0,"In this analysis, the authors use Greeley's ""religion as poetry"" model to frame an analysis of images of God and trust among the highly religious. Using the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, the authors regress four ordinal measures of social trust on two images of God measures and a bank of religion and demographic controls. The authors find that having a loving image of God creates greater levels of trust in all four measures among the highly religious. They also find that having an image of God as angry creates less trust in all four measures of trust. Implications for theory and research on trust and civic engagement are discussed in the conclusion."
0,"Are children's statements about their futures related to outcomes in middle age? In 1966 almost 13,500 children ages 12-13 were asked whether they thought their futures would be worse, similar or better as compared to others of their own age. It was shown that children with low, and surprisingly high, expectations did suffer from increased mortality, economic hardship and weak labor market attachment risks in middle age. Although it cannot be ruled out that expectations worked as self-fulfilling prophesies, the analyses showed that expectations essentially reflected facts known to the children (i.e., upbringing conditions and their own abilities and achievements)."
0,"Using data on young English learners (EL) who enroll in the New York City public school system, I examine how long it takes students to become minimally proficient in English and how the time to proficiency differs for students by their age of school entry. Specifically, I follow four recent entry cohorts of ELs ages 5-10 and use discrete-time survival analysis to model the rate at which different age groups acquire proficiency. I find that approximately half of the students become proficient within three years after school entry and that younger students learn more quickly than older students. Age of entry differences are robust to controls for observed differences between age of entry groups in their economic and demographic characteristics, their disabilities, and the schools they attend. The results lend support to the theory that older students face developmental barriers to learning new languages quickly. "
0,"There is widespread agreement in criminology that some crimes are more serious than others, but precise definitions of crime seriousness and straightforward methods for measuring it have been elusive. Public perceptions of crime seriousness and economic analyses of crime costs to society or willingness to pay offer a variety of metrics for the publics perceptions of seriousness, but they may not accurately describe seriousness as reflected in offender preferences. The preference of offenders is critical, however, for understanding developmental progressions in criminal careers. In the present paper we propose an alternative metric of crime seriousness, drawing on developmental criminology, and a method for estimating crime seriousness that uses the generalized Bradley-Terry model of multiple paired comparisons. We demonstrate this approach on two samples of youthful offenders. The analysis suggests that sample-specific estimates of crime seriousness can be derived, that these estimates provide insight into developmental crime progression, and that they correspond well to crime seriousness rankings produced by the public."
0,"Population aging is driving an increase in the demand for healthcare services, the bulk of which is delivered by low-wage workers in jobs with low cost of entry, e.g. nursing assistants, home health aides, and physical therapy aides. In response to high turnover of entry-level jobs and worker shortages in mid-level jobs and the attendant costs, some employers are moving to adopt an old economy business model: firm internal labor markets (FILMs). Organizations use FILMS to induce high commitment from employees by demonstrating high commitment on the part of employers. In this paper, we have three objectives: 1) describe the growing challenge in healthcare of high turnover for low-wage positions and work shortages in mid-level positions, 2) analyze interviews with healthcare business leaders participating in a workforce development program to determine the business cases they make for FILM development, and 3) explore the problems and possibilities associated with the introduction of FILMs to frontline healthcare work. If employers can overcome challenges, there is great potential for FILMs to enrich job quality for workers, to lower costs and raise standards of care for organizations, and to enhance the quality of care for patients."
0,"In this paper, I examine the tradeoffs a worker center faces when organizing people around an ethnic rather than workplace identity. Immigrant worker centers in the US can be nearly evenly divided between those that focus on workplace issues, and those that address members problems not only at work, but also in other domains including housing and immigration. Much of the limited research available on this topic has focused on workplace-oriented worker centers, demonstrating that they can carve a welcoming space for traditional unionization drives or work-related legislative campaigns. Yet the possible strategies and impact of non-workplace-oriented worker centers, and particularly those that exclusively target one ethnic group, are less understood. I explore this question with a case study of the Pilipino Workers Center (PWC). For over 10 years, PWC has been organizing primarily undocumented Filipino immigrants in Los Angeles to help them make advances on issues of work, housing, banking, and immigration. I show how PWCs focus on Filipino immigrants has had mixed results in addressing members workplace struggles, but has helped the organization develop crucial alliances and access significant resources to address non-workplace issues."
0,"Research links sex ratios with the likelihood of marriage and divorce. However, whether sex ratios similarly influence precursors to marriage (transitions in and out of dating or cohabiting relationships) is unknown. Utilizing data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study and the 2000 U.S. Census, this study assesses whether sex ratios influence the formation and stability of emerging adults' romantic relationships. Findings show that relationship formation is unaffected by partner availability, yet the presence of partners increases women's odds of cohabiting, decreases men's odds of cohabiting, and increases number of dating partners and cheating among men. It appears that sex ratios influence not only transitions in and out of marriage, but also the process through which individuals search for and evaluate partners prior to marriage."
0,"In the past 50 years, structural real estate speculators in New York City have embraced a succession of different visions for the city. Elites’ changing objectives for New York are identified by examining the changing and contradictory plans for Battery Park City, a large, upper-class  planned community that was built in on landfill along the Hudson River, directly across from the World Trade Center. Examination of the history and conflicts that produced the plans identifies four distinct periods between 1950 and the present, reflected in the city’s public spaces: working-class space, privatized space, filtered space, and suburban space."
0,"Are record companies actively discriminating against female musicians, limiting their success at every turn?  Or are promoters scrambling to satisfy consumers desires for female acts, but unable to do so because there are too few female artists seeking major record contracts?  How does gender matter to record company promoters?  This project answers that question by comparing the number of male and female artists in a heavily promoted sample with the proportion of male and female artists in a larger sample.  Gender differences due to genre, track record, and sexuality are discussed."
0,"Is the acting white hypothesis empirically viable? The strong version of this hypothesis-that African American students are negatively sanctioned by peers for academic success, while their similar white peers are not sanctioned-misses the possibility that some students preemptively pull back academic effort without having received sanctions. This article tests a weak version of the hypothesis-that some academically engaged African American students perceive the costs of peer sanctions to be sufficiently high to scale back overt academic engagement before receiving peer sanctions. The weak version predicts sufficiently high costs of sanctions in schools with racialized social norms about academic engagement. The author uses multilevel modeling to test strong and weak versions of the hypothesis on a nationally representative sample of African American and white students. While the results do not support the strong version of the acting white hypothesis, they point to a mild form of the weak version of the hypothesis."
0,"Cumulative disadvantage theories predict divergence over time between individuals of differing achieved and ascribed statuses. One person builds resources and assets, while another loses them, thus increasing inequality. My research builds on these theories by examining whether credit and labor markets intersect through the event of bankruptcy to disadvantage certain individuals. Previous research shows a strong connection between labor market situations and bankruptcy, where adverse events that include a loss of income increase an individual’s debt burden and risk of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy offers individuals an opportunity to purge previous debt, but it can be a stigmatizing process with later negative outcomes including job and income loss. I therefore test a model that depicts a cycle of job loss, increased debt, and bankruptcy over time as part of a process of cumulative disadvantage. This paper draws from my broader model by investigating how adverse events of income loss, marital dissolution, and illness, along with debt to earnings ratios affect an individual’s probability of filing for bankruptcy. I address bankruptcy’s role in a system of increasing inequality using fixed effects models with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. My findings replicate previous bankruptcy research, while contributing to additional research on cumulative disadvantage, labor and credit market inequality, and bankruptcy policy."
0,"Kantian philosophers, Richard Rorty remarked in Philosophy as a Kind of Writing: An Essay on Derrida, would like not to write, but just to show. They would like the words they use to be so simple as to be presuppositionless. They like to think, he adds, that physics, too, is not a kind of writing. Sociology, too, many of its practitioners would also like to think, is a kind of writing which would like not to be a kind of writing. Whatever its disciplinary provenance, writing that would like not to be a kind of writing is a writing that sees itself as ontologically distinct from literary language. This paper examines the processes by which the distinction between scientific and literary language is constructed and maintained within professional sociology. Based on a literary critical analysis of the routine, everyday reading and writing practices of professional sociology I argue that this distinction between literary and scientific language is constructed and reproduced through these everyday practices and that through these practices and this linguistic distinction realist sociology of the sort found in the mainstream journals of the discipline is reproduced on a daily basis."
0,Research demonstrates a positive relationship between public attitudes toward women and rape myth acceptance. Little is known about whether this relationship also exists within police culture. The current study assesses the relationship between police officers' attitudes toward women and their attitudes toward rape. The effect of educational attainment on these attitudes is also assessed. A survey was administered to 891 police officers from two states in the southeastern United States. There was a significant difference on measures of modern sexism and the acceptance of rape myths with varying levels of educational attainment.
0,"New economy initiatives are often oriented to high satisfaction, egalitarian outcomes, low eco- footprints, and enhanced levels of learning. This paper considers the potential for transformation provided by one market alternative, time banking, among older women of color living in New York City. Time banks use an internal currency, measured time dollars or hours. In that way, they have the potential to facilitate a new “economy” in which all participants can deploy an equally distributed asset (their time) to secure access to services. This counteracts the highly unequal nature of the market economy and should increase opportunities for people whose labor market options are constrained. The author analyzes results of a membership survey conducted by the Visiting Nurse's Service of New York (VNSNY) of its Community Connections Time Bank (CCTB) in 2008-2009. The uses multinomial logistic regression and interaction analyses to show the following: (1) As members receive more hours of service their odds of reporting improvements in physical health significantly increase; (2) As members provide more hours of service their odds of reporting improvements in mental health increase; and (3) Members who report learning new skills in connection with time bank membership are significantly more apt to report improvements of both physical and mental health."
0,"Previous scholars have charged that Durkheim provides an inadequate theory of inequality, that the concept of organic solidarity is not well supported, and that egoistic and anomic suicide cannot be adequately distinguished. Although these problems appear distinct, they each arise because Durkheim naturalized inequality and ignored social status. Introducing a concept of status permits a reconceptualization of the types of suicide and creates new analytic connections between The Division of Labor and Suicide. Social solidarity and status hierarchies are presented as variations in the relationship between social integration and social regulation. The interplay between status and solidarity influences the expression of social practice, power, belief, and justice."
0,"This article challenges the conventional dichotomy between the civic-Western and ethnic.-Eastern forms of national attachments and empirically explores the link between national feelings and anti-immigrant sentiment, as expressed by European publics. We use data from the 1995 and 2003 ISSP modules to: (1) expose the multidimensional nature of national feelings, and (2) investigate the cross-country variation in mean levels and inter-regional heterogeneity in the severity of effects on anti-immigrant sentiment for four dimensions of national feelings. The results show that there are important regional differences in the mean levels and effects exerted by the civic and ethnic national feelings at both points in time. Overall, these findings point to the limited relevance of the conceptual demarcation between the Western-civic and Eastern-ethnic types, as a trend of cross-regional convergence is rather strongly supported. We discuss the implications of the results within the broader context of post-communist transition and eastward enlargement of the European Union. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"Most sociological research assumes that social network composition shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered."
0,"This article focuses on three Countries with distinct policies toward motherhood and work: Germany, Sweden and the United States. We analyze the length of mothers' time Out Of paid work after childbirth and the short-term career consequences for mothers. In the United States, we identify a career punishment even for short time-out periods; long time-out periods increase the risk of a downward move and reduce the chances of an upward move. In Germany, long time-out periods destabilize the career and, the longer the leave, the greater the risk of either an upward or downward move. In Sweden, we find a negative effect of time Out on upward moves. Hence, even in ""woman-friendly' Sweden, women's career prospects are better if they return to paid work sooner rather than later."
0,"The study of institutional myths has been central to organizational sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of education for 30 years. This article examines how the myth concept has been used and develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as ""accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh? Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide answers and reveal ""recoupling'' processes through which institutional myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that teachers labeled ""turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by ""inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities, social interactions, and meaning-making processes."
0,"Social psychological research on group processes has consistently shown that group members adjust their views to conform to dominant and/or socially desirable stances. Studies are less clear, though, on how friendships within groups impact this tendency. Some studies suggest greater group cohesion leads to more conformity; other studies suggest friendship lessens the pressure to agree on certain issues. In this study, we use mock juries to test the impact of varying levels of friendship on jurors' propensities to change their verdicts to the dominant position (in this case acquittal, or a ""not guilty"" verdict). Our findings show that distant friendships among jurors increase the odds of conforming to acquittal; but close friendships decrease the odds of conformity. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding group processes and conformity as well as for jury research."
0,"This paper employs ethnographic observation and semi-structured interviews to examine the interrelated processes of desistance and transitions to young adulthood among formerly incarcerated young men. By tracking a prospective sample of 12-15 reform school graduates from the pre-release period through 18 months after their return to the community, I explore the ways in which urban youth rationalize the experience of incarceration with the cultural exigencies of the street. I posit that there is a tension between the institutional and community contexts that mirror the tensions between decent and street orientations outlined in Andersons Code of the Street.  Moreover, I contend that the way that young people perceive and make sense of this tension has consequences for the way they interact with facility staff and the meaning that the experience of incarceration has for them  which I believe may have significant consequences for desistance and other transitions to adulthood.  I also explore the ways in which the street orientation is approached inside institutions. Facility staff frequently treats any symbol of street orientation as an indication that a youth has not yet committed himself to a conventional lifestyle.  Release from the facility is contingent upon ones ability to at least for the period of incarceration, strip oneself of language, clothing, and other outward displays of urban culture during interactions with staff members.  As my informants suggest, sometimes this is accompanied by a feeling of identity shift; for others, it means one learns to fake it or make it."
0,"We examine whether sex of child affects parents' beliefs about traditional gender roles. Using an improved methodological approach that explicitly analyzes the natural experiment via differences in differences, we find that having a daughter (vs. having a son) causes men to reduce their support for traditional gender roles, but a female child has no such effect among women, representing less than 4 percent of the size of the standard deviation of the attitude scale."
0,"Many social processes are described only in ordinary language, though often there are advantages to stating the ideas more precisely using mathematics. Intuitive ad hoc models are less valuable than are models representing explicit theories because theoretical models are useful beyond particular situations for which they were created. We describe 13 ways in which individuals might use information about status structures and communication from others to guide their behavior, and construct simple mathematical models of the processes. Three models derive from explicit theoretical assumptions and 10 are based in intuitive ideas about how individuals process information. Next we assess empirical success of the 13 models by comparing their predictions to behavior in an experimental setting. All the models fare well by comparison with a null hypothesis of no effects of structure or interaction, but the theoretically-based models make the best predictions. We discuss some reasons for the outcomes and for the intuitive appeal of intuitive models. Both the poorer predictions and the intuitive appeal of intuitive models, oddly enough, may trace to their lack of conditionalizing their predictions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"In the effort to understand the cumulative risk of different pollutants to a community’s health it is easy to focus on the forest and miss the trees. In order to adequately craft environmental policy researchers need to be able to make explicit how different pollution sources affect populations.  Because the history of urban development varies for highways, factories and other sources of pollution, as well as population settlement patterns near these sites, we argue that pollution sources should not be aggregated into one variable but be examined separately. To this end we investigate how both large and small sources of industrial pollution, as well as mobile sources, contribute to health risks of different racial groups in the census tracts that make up America’s metropolitan areas. Our findings suggest that there are indeed differences of pollution exposure based on both race and type of pollutant and these patterns vary across metropolitan areas. African-Americans and Asians were shown to be more likely to live in those metro areas that have higher risk of cancer from major and minor industrial sources and live in the more polluted parts of these areas.  When examining respiratory risks we found that no matter the pollution source, African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics all tended to live not only in more polluted metropolitan but also in polluted parts in each metropolitan area.   These results highlight the need to untangle different population, metro areas and pollution sources in environmental justice studies."
0,"Research has confirmed a motherhood penalty and fatherhood bonus at work. Employers, it appears, regard mothers and fathers differently from one another and differently from non-parents. We have yet to systematically explore whether mothers exhibit fewer pro-work behaviors than fathers and non-parents or whether fathers engage in more of them than mothers and non-parents. This article draws on nationally representative data from full-time employed adults to investigate mother, father, and non-parent differences in work effort, work intensity, job engagement, and four measures of work enhancement from home. Mothers and fathers are similar on five out of seven outcomes tapping pro-work dimensions. When they differ, mothers report greater job engagement and work intensity than fathers. Mothers are no different from non-parents on all outcomes. All findings hold net of individual, job, and family controls. I conclude that reducing workplace gender inequality will require organizational changes that pay explicit attention to workers' care-giving responsibilities. "
0,"Is the homogenous grouping of students by ability conducive to learning for all students alike, or does it affect students of different ability levels differently? To address this question, I compare the distributions of math performance for students between Grade 8 and Grade 4 across countries with different levels of between-classroom ability grouping, controlling for country-level unobserved heterogeneity using a fixed-effects model. Homogeneous grouping, relative to heterogeneous grouping, is found to have no significant impact on mean performance, but it does increase performance inequality by benefiting the high achievers at the expense of the low achievers.

0,"This paper investigates the factors that influence and structure economic activities in a Certified Farmers Market in an affluent suburban area of Southern California. We conducted participant observation for four months in the Certified Farmers Market, assuming both the role of customer and the role of vendor. During our ethnographic study we came to understand the market as a social arena, in which economic transactions such as selling and buying are structured by social and cultural interpretations and interactions, and in which economic actors are connected through social relations and activities. Our findings suggest that the economic activities that take place at the market are embedded in larger social, cultural, and institutional contexts, supporting therefore the theory of social embeddedness developed by Granovetter (1985) and Zukin and DiMaggio (1990)."
0,"Members of social categories with multifaceted definitions are often sampled using only one or two characteristics, generating theoretical and methodological problems. Here, the author examines the case of ""dual-career"" couples. The author tests how closely respondents' and scholars' distinctions between careers versus jobs correspond and how well selected definition models capture career-oriented couples. Members of fifty-one married couples self-identify as having a job or career and then explain how they differentiate those concepts. Respondents' rationales correspond well to scholarly definitions, focusing primarily on time and emotional investments, and less on advancement or income. Work orientation generally varies, as predicted, by education and work characteristics, although many people presumed to be career-oriented report having jobs (e. g., professional women), and vice versa (e. g., part-time workers). Systematic tests of definition models suggest that many sampling approaches used in dual-career couple studies either omit many career-oriented respondents or include many who are job-oriented. Sampling strategies are discussed."
0,"From 1973 to 2007, private sector union membership in the United States declined from 34 to 8 percent for men and from 16 to 6 percent for women. During this period, inequality in hourly wages increased by over 40 percent. We report a decomposition, relating rising inequality to the union wage distribution's shrinking weight. We argue that unions helped institutionalize norms of equity, reducing the dispersion of nonunion wages in highly unionized regions and industries. Accounting for unions' effect on union and nonunion wages suggests that the decline of organized labor explains a fifth to a third of the growth in inequality-an effect comparable to the growing stratification of wages by education."
0,"A debate within the mortality literature centers around the impact of health behaviors on the prospects of disadvantaged groups. Meanwhile, a growing body of work illustrates the social processes that shape changes in smoking levels by socioeconomic status (SES), especially educational attainment. These literatures are merged by examining the mediating effects of cigarette smoking on education gaps in U.S. adult mortality by age and gender. Findings reveal that cigarette smoking is an important mediator of the education-mortality gap for all males and for younger females. In particular, education-mortality gaps for young men narrow considerably when cigarette smoking is accounted for, while older women experienced no reduction in the education-mortality gap with controls for smoking. These results are consistent with diffusion arguments that describe SES differences in smoking adoption by age and gender and provide strong evidence that smoking is an important differentiator of mortality risks by education.

0,"Following reforms in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, a large environmental movement erupted across the nation.  At the time, it was the largest and most powerful critical group in the repressive regime.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the environmental movement fell back into abeyance.  This paper investigates the reasons for the collapse of the Russian environmental movement using a revised political process model that emphasizes cognitive liberation as a principle variable.  I suggest that cognitive liberation is based upon grounded knowledge and social trust: as corruption and lawlessness increased in the post-transition years, people’s sense of efficacy decreased.  Moreover, I argue that the political opportunity structure operates dialogically with cognitive liberation.  Elites were able to close political opportunities in the 2000s because cognitive liberation among the general population had already been demoralized in the 1990s."
0,"Information on the institutional arrangements of citizenship is increasingly available. However, we currently have only limited knowledge on the contours of public opinion towards citizenship. We seek to remedy this neglect by documenting patterns of support toward the most dominant citizenship principles: jus soli, jus sanguinis, and jus domicile. Specifically, we combine responses to questions on these principles to create a single measure of opinion toward citizenship law that encompasses three dominant citizenship approaches: assimilationist, exclusionary, and pluralist. Using data from the 2003 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) module on National Identity, we examine cross-national differences in support for the three approaches. Our results indicate that only two regime-types can clearly be identified - a pluralist regime, which centers on the importance of jus soli and includes traditional settler societies and Sweden, and an assimilationist regime, which is typified by its acceptance of jus domicile and includes the post-colonial empires of France and Britain. On the individual level, our analysis highlights the importance of perceptions of threat, either economically or culturally, in shaping public opinion toward citizenship. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Conflicting views on serving portray the occupation as either transitional or dead-end. In the first case, the dominant conclusion in the literature is that students wait tables because the flexibility of employment enables them to combine school and work activities. In the second case, serving represents a trap for women in the labor force--just one link in a chain of front-line service occupations. Using matched CPS data, this paper explores mobility patterns among servers, particularly the mobility of student and women. In keeping with previous findings, this work concludes that students do indeed move out of serving at a faster rate than other groups, whereas women are likely to either remain waiting tables or move on to yet another front-line service occupation."
0,"Despite its centrality to contemporary inequality, working poverty is often popularly discussed but rarely studied by sociologists. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (2009), we analyze whether an individual is working poor across 18 affluent democracies circa 2000. We demonstrate that working poverty does not simply mirror overall poverty and that there is greater cross-national variation in working than overall poverty. We then examine four explanations for working poverty: demographic characteristics, economic performance, unified theory, and welfare generosity. We utilize Heckman probit models to jointly model the likelihood of employment and poverty among the employed. Our analyses provide the least support for the economic performance explanation. There is modest support for unified theory as unionization reduces working poverty in some models. However, most of these effects appear to be mediated by welfare generosity. More substantial evidence exists for the demographic characteristics and welfare generosity explanations. An individual's likelihood of being working poor can be explained by (a) a lack of multiple earners or other adults in one's household, low education, single motherhood, having children and youth; and (b) the generosity of the welfare state in which he or she resides. Also, welfare generosity does not undermine employment and reduces working poverty even among demographically vulnerable groups. Ultimately, we encourage a greater role for the welfare state in debates about working poverty. Keywords: poverty, work, working poor, social policy, labor markets."
0,"Between the 19th century and the mid 20th century, the environmental movement transformed American culture, forcing a rethinking of the Manifest Destiny ideology that had dominated political thinking towards an understanding of the need to protect and preserve the natural environment.  What drove this growth of the environmental movement?  Using the data of the GreenMoney Project, we examine a 100-year time-series of environmental movement organization (EMO) foundings, showing that, in addition to the legitimation-and-competition effects of organizational density, EMO founding are facilitated by economic affluence, the discourse-creative activities of critical communities, objective threats in terms of air pollution, and alienation from the political system based on 3rd party Presidential voting and unemployment.  Powerful political allies and elite divisions do not play a significant role.  Environmental mobilization needs to be understood in terms of the creation of new discursive frames that identify environmental problems, objective environmental threats, the resources that allow political entrepreneurs to launch new EMOs, and the political alienation that energizes environmental activists and creates popular concern about the environment"
0,"This study contributes to extant research that addesses the impact of institutions on individuals by examining the consequences of deviance removal on individuals sense of self.  We assess the effects of four disruptive experiences: incarceration, hospitalization, drug treatment, and homelessness, on changes in global self-esteem throughout the life course.  To the degree that individuals who are removed from society feel demoralized, are labeled as deviant, and/or experience social disaffiliation, such removal should have negative effects on the adults self-esteem.  The data employed in this study are taken from the Harlem Longitudinal Study of Urban Black Youth, a five-wave study of African Americans ages 12-18 in the late 1960s and ages 35-41 in the 1990s.  Findings support our hypothesis that deviance removal has detrimental effects on global self esteem. We find that larger number of removal experiences do lead to declines in self esteem early in the life course.  Yet, these declines in self esteem do not persist into later adulthood.  This suggests that the timing of deviance removal plays an important role in individuals abilities to resist the negative consequences for their self concepts.  We conclude by discussing how this research further informs the relationship between institutions and individual well-being."
0,"Many scientific and nonscientific activities involve practices of counting. Counting is, perhaps, the most elementary of numerical practices: an ability to count is presupposed in arithmetic and other branches of mathematics, and counting also is part of innumerable everyday and specialized activities. Though it is a simple practice when considered abstractly, in specific cases counting can be quite complicated, contentious, and socially consequential. Categorical judgments determine what counts as an eligible case, instance, or datum, and these judgments can be difficult and controversial. By focusing on such difficulties, this article aims to elucidate practices that are crucial for the production and stabilization of natural and social orders. Cases discussed in the article are provisionally divided between counting ( nonhuman) things and counting people. Cases of counting things include scientific practices of counting the number of human chromosomes and forensic procedures for counting matches in DNA profiles. Cases of counting people include estimates of crowd size and counts and recounts of election ballots. Counting people not only is a matter of including an object or person in a class or group, but also involves reciprocal performances in which the counted objects are complicit in, or resistive to, the social production of counts. Variable, and otherwise troubled and contested, instances of counting are used to elucidate the numero-politics of counting: how assigning numbers to things is embedded in disciplined fields, systems of registration and surveillance, technological checks and verifications, and fragile networks of trust. Keywords: counting, numero-politics, science, classification, estimation."
0,"In this article, I examine the troublesome notion of ""post-Marxism."" First, I read post-Marxism as an expression of the transformations entailed by our post-1968 entry into what world-systems thinkers call ""an age of transition."" Second, drawing on Tormey and Townshend's work, I explore the thematic unity of post-Marxism in terms of six problems posed to Marxism-the problems of history, revolutionary subjectivity, ethics, positivism, vanguardism, and democracy. Third, I suggest that, given the many questions raised by post-Marxist efforts to go beyond these problems, and given the passing of the phase of what Holmes has called ""happy globalization,"" serious doubts are raised about the theoretical and utopian gains achieved by post-Marxism and the distance we might want to travel from the suggestions offered by the Marxian tradition."
0,"This article examines why and how environmental activists, despite considerable political weakness and disproportionallly few resources, won substantive negotiating concessions that far outstripped labor achievements during NAFTA's negotiation. Despite a trade policy arena hostile to their demands, environmentalists gained official recognition for the legitimacy of their claims, obtained a seat at the negotiating table, turned a previously technocratic concern into a highly visible populist issue, and won an environmental side agreement stronger than its labor counterpart. We argue that this unexpected outcome is best explained by environmentalists' strategic use of mechanisms available at the intersection of multiple fields. While field theory mainly focuses on interactions within a particular field, we suggest that the structure of overlap between fields-the architecture of field overlap-creates unique points of leverage that render particular targets more vulnerable and certain strategies more effective for activists. We outline the mechanisms associated with the structure of field overlap-alliance brokerage, rulemaking, resource brokerage, and frame adaptation-that enable activists to strategically leverage advantages across fields to transform the political landscape."
0,"This study examines the effects of living with ""nontraditional"" siblings (i.e., step- and/or half-siblings) on the verbal ability scores, grade point averages (GPAs), and college expectations of adolescents and whether sibling composition effects are moderated by family structure. On average, youth who live with step- or half-siblings report significantly poorer outcomes than youth who do not. The sibling composition effects on verbal ability scores and grades are similar in direction and magnitude across family types. The association between nontraditional siblings and the college expectations of youth, however, appear to be conditioned by family structure, such that youth living with two biological parents or single mothers are negatively affected by the presence of half-siblings and the expectations of youth living in stepfather families are negatively affected by the presence of step- siblings. The mechanisms underlying sibling composition effects on academic-related outcomes also vary by family structure."
0,"This paper examines the prevalence of work instability between 1981 and 2001.  Instead of the usual measures of employer and occupational instability, we use compound instability, defined as the concurrent change of occupation and employer.  We describe the theoretical benefits of compound instability.  We then measure the incidence of various forms of instability using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.  Unlike studies of employer and occupational stability, we find no period effect on compound instability.  Likewise, there is no support for a cohort effect wherein older workers are at a higher risk of compound instability over time.  The implications of these findings are discussed and further research is proposed."
0,"This study scrutinizes the construct validity of three corruption indices by assessing their discriminant and convergent validity in reference to democracy and the shadow economy with a Multi-Trait-Multi-Method technique. It turns out that prominent indices of corruption (such as the Corruption Perception Index) do not only measure a countrys level of corrupt activities but also the degree of democracy due to their multidimensionality. While the convergent validity of corruption indices is warranted, discriminant validity must be considered as rather low. This implies problems like collinearity if multidimensional constructs are used for multivariate analysis."
0,"This paper is concerned with choice and food, the explicit understanding of the politics involved in the acquisition and consumption of food and the social politics which are tied up in those decisions.   Narrowly speaking, this is a paper about people who elect to eat garbage, not out of need, but out of a commitment to political ideals.  Broadly however, it is a consideration of what taking control of the politics of food and consumption as a means of expressing both difference and defiance means.  Meaning is made socially by the body that sustains itself with food that is deemed garbage and by the actor who speaks about this decision as one rooted not solely in the rejection of social norms, but rather as one rooted in the politics of justice, sustainability, and even hope for social and economic revolution.  Consideration of this topic must work to understand and evaluate the social processes operative in the decision made to work toward opting out of the privileges and responsibilities of consumptive choice and the social responses to these decisions.  To this end, the voices of those who have publicly advocated dumpstering food as a life choice are heavily drawn upon as are the theories of Pierre Bourdieu and Alberto Melucci in order to place dumpstering, its social logic and politics, in a broader social context."
0,"Using data from the 1996 Survey of Income and Program Participation, we examine 4476 school-age children in 2569 families with matched pairs of married fathers and mothers to study children's academic progress as a function of fathers' and mothers' employment circumstances, with a particular focus on involuntary employment separations. We draw on weekly work histories, collected at 4-month intervals, to characterize parental employment circumstances over a two-year period. Results find no significant associations between mothers' employment experiences and children's academic progress, even in households where mothers earn more than fathers. In contrast, fathers' experience of involuntary employment separations is associated with children's academic progress. On average, fathers' experience of involuntary employment separations is associated with a higher likelihood of children's grade repetition and suspension/expulsion from school. However, subgroup analyses reveal this association only in households where mothers earn more than fathers. We conclude that the adverse impacts of fathers' involuntary employment separations in two-parent families have less to do with income losses than with family dynamics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

0,"Although a growing body of literature is being produced on mayoral control of school systems in America, few studies have qualitatively explored the governing practices of these bureaucracies.  This paper examines the mechanisms of institutional control and assessment protocols of the New York City Department of Education.  Conducting interviews with thirty managers and administrators, and examining documents, forms and technology that mediate school performance, I utilize personal accounts to exhibit how the innovation of a market-based structure now allows for greater individual student intervention and clear expectations for schools. This case study exhibits how education administrators reproduce, contest and reconstitute education reform efforts in America’s largest and most diverse school district, it illuminates the day-to-day efforts involved in establishing institutional legitimacy and informs policy efforts to implement federal mandates and system-wide change."
0,"Past studies of migration have overlooked the role that institutions in the pre-migration context in creating a ""culture of migration."" This study focuses on the way media institutions in the pre-migration context frame and explain mass migration. I analyze portrayals of Puerto Rican migration in the national daily periodical El Mundo during the postwar period (1945-1955), during which more than 500,000 Puerto Ricans emigrated from the island to the United States. Using content analysis of news articles on migration, I examine whether media portrayals during this period coincide with scholarly analyses about the Great Migration. My results illustrate that while scholars attribute Puerto Rican emigration to overpopulation and rising unemployment, news articles consistently addressed issues related to employment, while rarely mentioning the impact of overpopulation. In addition, my findings show that articles in the early years of the Great Migration portray migration positively or debate the issue. In the later years, there are signfiicantly more articles that portray migration negatively as well as articles that treated migration neutrally."
0,"This research assesses the extent to which facial appearance is related to occupational status attainment. Through the use of Internet technology, a diverse random sample of research participants viewed Navy boot camp photographs and rated sailors across nine dimensions. Sailors who were rated highly attractive were also thought to be intelligent and to possess leadership qualities. And, consistent with social expectancy theory and status generalization theory, sailors who were rated high across these three traits advanced to higher ranks, and did so more rapidly, than those rated low on these traits. The findings of this study underscore the sociological significance of facial appearance as a means by which people are stratified within social structural contexts."

0,"Special properties of social networks may strongly influence dynamics of interorganizational trust in goodwill for future collaboration.  Because of new insights gleaned from the embeddedness approach, many researchers discuss this by giving considerable attention to the special quality of ties and the structural properties of social networks that facilitate the building of trust.  In conventional studies of Japanese typical buyer-supplier relations, keiretsu, strong and multiplex ties of managers between organizations have been considered to facilitate the development of interorganizational trust in goodwill.  However, it still remains unclear how these networks actually help the development of it, due to the lack of the network analysis.  In keeping with the embeddedness approach, the aim of this paper is to consider how a high level of relational embeddedness in the social networks of managers across organizations develops positive recognition of trust in goodwill in dyads, and how special properties of structural embeddedness also amplify this trust by exchange of reputation of a goodwill keeper.  To examine this phenomenon, I empirically analyze embeddedness and social cognition of trust in the social networks of managers within two supplier associations of Japanese electronic manufacturers."
0,"Previous research has overwhelmingly found that Evangelical Protestants are generally less tolerant of outsiders than those of other religious traditions such as Catholics or Mainline Protestants. Using data from the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, I examine the extent to which political tolerance is related to a bonding type of social capital that is typical of Evangelical Protestantism. Findings support most of the previous research into the relationship between religion and political tolerance, and support the hypothesis that social embeddedness within ones congregation predicts intolerance among Evangelical Protestants, but not among those of other religious traditions. Implications for research into religious friendship networks and their potential dysfunctions are discussed."
0,"College major choice is a much-neglected yet highly significant topic in sociological research. This article focuses on family socioeconomic status (SES) and parental involvement to examine potential family influences on patterned college major choice by gender, race/ethnicity, and nativity. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study 1988-1994 (NELS: 88-94), this study confirms old gender patterns and finds new racial/ethnic patterns in college major choice. Lower SES children are found to favor more lucrative college majors. Family SES is found to have differential effects on men and women and for racial/ethnic minorities and whites. Parental involvement in children's domain-specific education exerts significant effects on children's college major choice. These together suggest important theoretical and policy implications."
0,"Researchers have used status characteristics theory (SCT) to explain the relationship between gender beliefs and interactional disadvantages faced by women in mixed-sex task settings. Several recent studies raise questions about the theory's findings concerning gender differences in influence, leading some to speculate that prestige differences between women and men are disappearing. We share the view that inconsistencies in sex-related differences are often explained by methodological dissimilarities. Possible changes in cultural beliefs about gender are confounded with protocol changes and also differences in communication medium across SCT studies, thereby making it difficult to determine whether recent findings reflect cultural changes or methodological artifacts. We conducted a laboratory experiment examining the effects of gender status and communication medium on influence, controlling for protocol details. The results suggest that gender is ""alive and well"" as a status characteristic and, most interestingly, that partner visibility appears to affect status processes by enhancing status differentiation. Our approach and the implications of our results are discussed with reference to the more general issue of the importance of systematic replication for theory growth in social science research. "
0,"Adversity early in life may alter pathways of aging, but what interpretive processes can soften the blow of early insults? Drawing from cumulative inequality theory, the authors analyze trajectories of life evaluations and then consider whether early adversity offsets favorable expectations for the future. Results reveal that early adversity contributes to more negative views of the past but rising expectations for the future. Early adversity also has enduring effects on life evaluations, offsetting the influence of buoyant expectations. The findings draw attention to the limits of human agency under the constraints of early adversity a process described as biographical structuration."
0,"The state of social relationships between Blacks and Whites is typically investigated by means of individual-level factors and their influence on perceptions of comfort or unease. We hypothesize that neighborhood-level factors have an independent effect on these perceptions. We examine perceptions of interracial unease separately for Blacks and Whites and ask whether they are influenced by the context in which they are embedded. Theories of social organization and collective efficacy are invoked. We combine the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods-Community Survey with two other data sources and employ Hierarchical Modeling techniques. We find that propinquity behaves differently depending on race. Whites consistently perceive more unease, particularly when they live in relatively integrated neighborhoods. Blacks, in contrast, exhibit a curvilinear pattern, with those residing in relatively integrated neighborhoods reporting the lowest levels of perceived unease. Collective efficacy exerts an unexpected positive effect on unease for both Blacks and Whites."
0,"This paper employs data from a recent national survey to offer an empirical assessment of core theoretical tenets of whiteness studies. Using survey items developed explicitly for this purpose, we analyze three specific propositions relating to whites' awareness and conception of their own racial status: the invisibility of white identity; the understanding (or lack thereof) of racial privileges; and adherence to individualistic, color-blind ideals. Consistent with whiteness theories, we find that white Americans are less aware of privilege than individuals from racial minority groups and consistently adopt color-blind, individualist ideologies. However, we also find that whites are both more connected to white identity and culture as well as more aware of the advantages of their race than many theoretical discussions suggest. We then combine these results to estimate that 15 percent of white Americans exhibit what we call ""categorical whiteness,"" a consistent and uniform adherence to the theoretical tenets that are the focus of this body of theory. We conclude by suggesting that these findings provide the basis for a more nuanced, contextualized understanding of whiteness as a social phenomenon."
0,"The expansion of global trade in the post-war period is subject to various interpretations. Some stress the trade-promoting role of the novel features in the world economy; some insist on the role of traditional factors, such as geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity, in continuously depressing trade flows; others even argue that the importance of these traditional factors has been on the rise. To adjudicate the divergence, this article applies the gravity model to a large data set on global bilateral trade from 1950 through 2000. Although the global institutional factor does promote bilateral trade and global economic activity indeed becomes more trade-generating, the trade-depressing effects of geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity remain strong. Moreover, geographic and cultural proximity actually generates greater gravity over time that draws countries together, which may trigger fragmentation in global trade along geo-cultural lines."
0,"A burgeoning literature considers the consequences of mass imprisonment for the well-being of adult men and-albeit to a lesser degree-their children. Yet virtually no quantitative research considers the consequences of mass imprisonment for the well-being of the women who are the link between (former) prisoners and their children. This article extends research on the collateral consequences of mass imprisonment by considering the association between paternal incarceration and maternal mental health using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Results show that recent paternal incarceration increases a mother's risk of a major depressive episode and her level of life dissatisfaction, net of a variety of influences including prior mental health. The empirical design lends confidence to a causal interpretation: effects of recent incarceration persist even when the sample is limited to mothers attached to previously incarcerated men, which provides a rigorous counterfactual. In addition, the empirical design is comprehensive; after isolating key mechanisms anticipated in the literature, we reduce the relationship between recent paternal incarceration and maternal mental health to statistical insignificance. These results imply that the penal system may have important effects on poor women's well-being beyond increasing their economic insecurity, compromising their marriage markets, or magnifying their risk of divorce."
0,"This article investigates structural sources of earnings losses in the U.S. labor market, analyzing data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups and Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that industry of employment represents a salient partition of the distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic skill-based accounts of earnings differences.

0,"Dominant theoretical explanations of racial disparities in criminal offending overlook a key risk factor associated with race: interpersonal racial discrimination. Building on recent studies that analyze race and crime at the micro-level, we specify a social psychological model linking personal experiences with racial discrimination to an increased risk of offending. We add to this model a consideration of an adaptive facet of African American culture: ethnic-racial socialization, and explore whether two forms-cultural socialization and preparation for bias-provide resilience to the criminogenic effects of interpersonal racial discrimination. Using panel data from several hundred African American male youth from the Family and Community Health Study, we find that racial discrimination is positively associated with increased crime in large part by augmenting depression, hostile views of relationships, and disengagement from conventional norms. Results also indicate that preparation for bias significantly reduces the effects of discrimination on crime, primarily by reducing the effects of these social psychological mediators on offending. Cultural socialization has a less influential but beneficial effect. Finally, we show that the more general parenting context within which preparation for bias takes place influences its protective effects."
0,"Prisons in Peoples Republic of China are often seen as a hidden institution, while prisons in the United States can be considered one of the most advanced correction system in the world. From a comparative and historical perspective, the present paper tries to analyze the prisons in these two countries in terms of their organization, characteristics of inmates, selection of officers, penology, correctional strategies, and rates of recidivism.  We can see that Chinese prisons are still under development since their harsh forced labor and few due process protections are almost similar to Foucault (1977)s description on western prisons in19th century. However, prisons in the United States still might benefits from some key features of the Chinese prison system. Influenced by both Confucianism and socialism, Chinese prisons emphasize malleable offenders, educational rehabilitation, professionalized officers and faith in state power. All these aspects may have positive meanings in current prison reforms."
0,"This study proposes a theoretical framework to understand how nations deal with collective memories of perpetration of severe human rights violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers' speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights language by proponents of the defensive arguments."
0,"We examine the effects of social networks on the global network structure of states specifically in the case of sovereign debt defaults. Following the institutionalism, world-system, and world-society perspectives in sociology, we assume that economic events are embedded in the social sphere and how state’s perceive others will affect their behavior. we predict that role equivalent and cohesive trade partners will be more likely to default if one of the pair defaults. We also predict that this effect will be stronger for countries with lower democracy. We test our hypotheses with data on 64 countries between 1962 and 2000, using fixed effects logistic regression and random effects logistic regression models. Controlling for macroeconomic and political economy variables, we find strong support that role equivalency increases the likelihood of sovereign default spillovers. The results reveal mixed findings about trade cohesion and the effects of democracy."
0,"Research on marginalization and health in the developing world lacks many theoretical perspectives.  I suggest a mid-level theory of how distinct forms of marginalization have unique health impacts. I conceptualize two forms of marginalization: isolation (a group confined to geographically isolated communities with limited outside relations) and exclusion (a group living among advantaged groups, but suffering discrimination in realms such as work, schooling, and housing). I hypothesize that the excluded group (scheduled castes) will face chronic malnutrition; in contrast, the isolated group (scheduled tribes) will suffer problems higher levels of acute malnutrition due to poor relations other communities. Data from the National Family Health Survey of India on 35,829 children under five show that children of scheduled tribes are most likely to be wasted, whereas children of scheduled castes are most likely to be stunted. Suggestions for future work on marginalization and health in the developing world are discussed."
0,"Environmental groups associate with other organizations in the movement sector as they mobilize to address environmental problems.  While the extent of these associations is well documented, few studies have systematically examined the content of these ties.  Consequently, we know a good deal concerning the types of ties held by environmental groups, but relatively little about the specifics of how other organizations in the field educate and socialize these advocates.  In particular, we need a greater understanding of the manner in which environmental activists learn movement activities.  By addressing the ongoing interaction of activist groups with other organizations, this project tackles a gap in the research on movement activities.  Specifically, this paper examines the manner in which environmental groups communicate tactical information among themselves and with other actors in the movement sectorindustry, government, and other nonprofit organizations.  Analysis of ethnographic data collected as a participant observer of an environmental group points to six mechanisms relevant to the circulation of tactical information.  This paper explores the significance of these findings to the study of the environmental movement and tactical choice."
0,"The connection between teacher ideas of caring and social class is important to explore.  This research provides an opportunity to examine perceptions of social class within a predominantly African American school.  In this paper I focus on the connection between teachers perceptions of parents and how they talk about their approach to caring for the students in their charge.  I conducted research at a pre-Kindergarten through fourth grade elementary school in a Texas metropolitan area from January 2000 through May 2002.  Clark Elementary's student body is 82 percent African American, and the teaching staff is 75 percent African American.  I begin with teacher perceptions of parents economic situation and briefly describe teacher experiences of parental involvement.  Next I explore how teachers defined caring for the students, including filling gaps, serving as role models, and transmitting certain standards of behavior, each as a way to correct poor behavior.  I conclude with a discussion of how class and caring intersect in the school environment.  Examining a school that has teachers of the same race/ethnicity as the students helps to place the focus on how class influences teacher-student-parent relationships."
0,"This study re-examines private sector influence in Mexicos1982  neoliberal economic transition, a transition typically attributed to an autonomous semi-authoritarian state. It does so by exploring two modes of private sector influence that may be more important in developing countries than in advanced industrial countries and which may also address the following two unresolved questions regarding Mexicos neoliberal transition: 1) Why did a group of politically savvy government employed economists (technocrats) pursue neoliberal economic reforms before the debt crisis of 1982? 2) How did technocrats associated with neoliberal reforms secure the presidential nomination in 1982? With an investigation of the  capacity of pro-neoliberal business sectors to mobilize through social networks, their relative economic power and attendant capacity to constrain government decisions through investments, this study reveals that private sector interests figured more prominently in Mexicos 1982 neoliberal transition than previously estimated and raises questions about the role of the domestic private sector in making successful neoliberal transitions possible more generally."
0,"While studies have examined the theory with various measures and methods in diverse settings, the process and strategies through which the well-to-do classes exclude others in order to maintain their advantaged positions is not entirely clear. Those that study self-exclusion have provided information on working-class members’ self-exclusion from desired educational trajectories, but few investigate the rejection of certain educational trajectories by middle-class families. Through observation and interviews with Chinese immigrant parents and their high school children, this paper examines how middle-class parents essentialize children’s college attendance and exercise self-exclusion by rejecting the alternative of not receiving college education. The results suggest that highly educated Chinese American parents strive to transmit their status to children through exercising self-exclusion by guiding their children towards certain types of college and majors. I argue that the advantaged classes engage in forms of self-exclusion that cause them to reject less-desired educational tracks by reinforcing normative expectations."
0,"This research examines the relationship between green criminology and political economic theories of ecological disorganization to advance the study of environmental crime. Specifically, this research suggests that green criminology can benefit by drawing upon the established theory of environmental disorganization, entitled treadmill of production (ToP), which was developed by Schnaiberg in the late 1970s. The purpose of this work is to describe ToP theory and organize green criminology according to three major components in that theory. First, we examine how ecological withdrawals can organize and advance green criminology. This section of the paper draws upon previous criminological research in the coal industry. Second, we examine how ecological additions, in the form of chemical pollution, can help to organize green criminology. Finally, we conclude by examining the concept of environmental justice within green criminology. As noted in the manuscript, criminologists have neglected issues of race and class when examining environmental crimes. Fortunately, treadmill of production theory offers unique insights into the connection between the political economy and environmental injustice."
0,"Over the last two decades, the Internet has changed various facets of social life, creating many social concerns. To better assess the impact of the Internet, it is important to understand the pattern of its diffusion. Using the Current Population Survey, this paper examines the diffusion process of the Internet between 1994 and 2007. The CPS provides seven cross-sectional data sets on Internet use over the period, four of which are spaced close enough to be turned into panel data sets. Simple trend analyses show that a logistic S-curve fits the seven observations very well, and that the diffusion took off around the time when the graphical user interface was introduced. Findings from multivariate trend analyses and panel data analyses include; (1) the digital divide is not likely to be closed in the near future, (2) exposure to the technology at school and workplace are important factors of initial and continued use of the Internet, and (3) of different online activities, email use is the most important predictor of continued use, implying that the diffusion process is highly social, rather than individualistic.

0,"This study builds on political mediation and movement infrastructure models to highlight contingent and synergistic ways in which social movements may impinge upon the U S. national policy-making process. Analyses employ a variety of datasets to examine the role of environmental movement organizational capacity, protest and institutional activity in garnering Congressional attention to, and action on, salient issues from 1961 through 1990 We find all types of movement activity, but especially the development of national organizational infrastructures, to be positively associated with the convening of Congressional hearings on the environment. Only when there are high levels of both protest and institutional activity is there any evidence that the environmental movement directly influences the passage of environmental laws."
0,"As more and more carework moves out of the realm of unpaid kin care into the market, sociologists have uncovered segregation and segmentation in the care labor market.  The majority of low-skill, low-paid care is an occupational ghetto for women, ethnic minorities, and immigrants.  While numerous studies explain labor market segregation and segmentation in general, very little research has addressed the mechanisms that create occupational segregation in care work.  I argue that the nature of care work shapes employers visions of the type of worker who will ideally fit particular care occupations.  Through an investigation of childcare hiring decisions, I explore a process I call Ethnic Logics through which employers link stereotypes about ethnic/racial groups to particular childrearing abilities.  Neither logical nor consistent, ethnic logics commodify race/ethnicity and create a mechanism through which certain types of people become more or less eligible for certain care occupations.  Because care work is so personal, it draws on some of the most deeply held assumptions individuals hold about who should perform what kinds of services for whom.  As the care work labor market continues to grow, it will become increasingly important to address how ethnic logics operate in these employment contexts."
0,This paper examines the intersection of culture and the sense of justice.  We explore the culture content of the major ingredients in the study of justice.  We provide both theoretical and empirical illustration.  The theoretical illustration analyzes the part played by the sense of justice in development of individualistic-collectivistic phenomena -- thus focusing on the reach of justice into culture processes.  The empirical illustration analyzes the possibility of culture content in justice quantities and relations -- thus focusing on the reach of culture into justice processes.
0,"Educational research and reforms tend to focus on what happens inside schools, despite research consistently indicating that non-school factors contribute more to the large achievement gap between different races and classes than do in-school factors.  Poverty impacts academic performance in myriad ways, but the research on neighborhood effects is particularly well developed.  As a result, recent research and commentary has focused on social reform – particularly involving housing policy – as a potential solution.  Research on the effects of housing policies, however, has been decidedly mixed.  Equally muddled is the theoretical framework underlying the attempt to alter educational performance through moving families to new homes and/or neighborhoods.  I review existing theory and research and introduce some additional factors that should be considered when designing and evaluating housing policy."
0,"This investigation assesses the relationships between racial threat and partisan dominance in state legislatures with tests of interactive hypotheses. The findings show that historically contingent expectations derived from racial threat theory, Republican law and order campaign appeals, and fundamentalist strength account for Republican strength in the legislatures. Two-way fixed-effects estimates based on pooled time-series analyses of 799 state-years in the post-civil rights era show that the percentage of Republicans in the state legislatures grew after increases in African American presence and the violent crime rates. The combined effects of a growth in African American and fundamentalist populations also account for increased Republican seats in these bodies. Statements by Republican campaign officials on how they deliberately used mass resentments against minorities to gain votes provide evidence about the intervening links between minority threat, the menace posed by high violent crime rates, and increased Republican strength in the state legislatures.

0,"This essay attempts to take a broad view of the historical forces that have shaped the discipline of sociology and continue to shape it. It is organized around the concept of crisis, arguing that sociology has been produced by crises and that it has been defined by its responses to crises. It identifies an ethic of control and manipulation as a chief product of 19th century responses. It suggests that we have once again entered a period of disruption and rapid change, and that the current challenge of sociology is to situate ourselves, reflexively, within a dense web of philosophical, psychological, social, biological, and environmental linkages, recognizing that we can never see the network in its entirety because we ourselves are nodes within it. However, the ethic of control and manipulation that we have inherited from earlier sociological responses often prevents sociologists from developing an immanent, reflexive, and ecological approach to the crisis of the present that would enable us to place ourselves within this web."
0,"Since the Internets inception in the early 1990s, sociological theorists and researchers have speculated on qualities of the Internet that make it inherently democratic and that lend itself to global communities and social movements. Indeed, unlike other communication media, the Internet provides a participatory interface and a two-way flow of information between user and medium. The Internet also contains virtual spaces where communities without borders can form containing users around the globe. These qualities of the Internet focusing on networking and participation would seem to make it the ultimate tool for democracy. This however is based on theory and reality tends to be antithetical. Online democracy is a precarious proposition and must be reconciled with the many misuses of the new medium, including the successes enjoyed by terrorists and hate-groups while operating within the new medium. More than anything however, notions of digital democracy must be reconciled with the digital divide: a new form of inequality created by those who have internet access compared to those who do not. As long as the digital divide persists and misuses of the Internet mar efforts made by civil society actors, it is premature to refer to the Internet as the new forum for democracy."
0,"This article examines whether correlates Of cross-national homicide variation tested with data from highly developed, predominantly Western nations could also explain homicide rates in East-Central Europe. Using pooled time-series analyses of data from nine countries from 1990 through 2003, this study found that homicide rates were negatively related to GDP/capita and positively related to ethnic diversity and population density. They were also negatively related to the percentage of young people and not significantly related to income inequality or divorce rates. This article also investigates whether conditions specific to the post-communist transformations contributed to homicide variation. Findings indicate that progressive reforms toward democratization and marketization decreased homicide rates. The discussion uses the socio-historical context of the nations to explain-these results."
0,"This paper focuses on a collaborative effort in the city of Pomona where college students, a faculty member, community advocates, and day laborers joined together to establish an official site from which day laborers could negotiate employment.  This case study is part of a larger story taking place in Los Angles and throughout the U. S. about how workers and college students are building partnerships and coalitions to empower workers and defend their rights. This paper draws out the lessons of applying a method of service learning and participatory action research that benefits all the partners involved."
0,"The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program offered public housing residents in distressed communities a chance to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. The present study examined whether the resulting decline in neighborhood poverty led to lower levels of exposure to danger among children and youth ages 8-19 years old (n = 4606), and specifically, if there was a gender difference that matched the pattern of more beneficial program effects for girls and more adverse affects for boys. The study goes beyond previous research by using fixed effects to control for family factors that may influence moving behavior and confound estimates of gender differences in program impacts. Results showed that children experienced a decline in exposure to danger, with one key gender difference. Models based on brother-sister comparisons indicated that MTO had a more beneficial impact on exposure to drug activity for females than males. The findings suggest that neighborhood poverty is tied to children's exposure to danger. Moreover, exposure to drug activity may help explain the gender differences in impacts on children's mental health and risky behavior. "
0,"Studies of teen dating violence have focused heavily on family and peer influences, but little research has been conducted on the relationship contexts within which violence occurs. The present study explores specific features of adolescent romantic relationships associated with the perpetration of physical violence. Relying on personal interviews with a sample of 956 adolescents, results indicate that respondents who self-report violence perpetration are significantly more likely than their non-violent counterparts to report higher levels of other problematic relationship dynamics and behaviors such as jealousy, verbal conflict, and cheating. However, we find no significant differences in levels of love, intimate self-disclosure, or perceived partner caring, and violent relationships are, on average, characterized by longer duration, more frequent contact, sexual intimacy and higher scores on the provision and receipt of instrumental support. Finally, violence is associated with the perception of a relatively less favorable power balance, particularly among male respondents. These findings complicate traditional views of the dynamics within violent relationships, add to our understanding of risk factors, and may also shed light on why some adolescents remain in physically abusive relationships.

0,"How do decentralized systems collectively solve problems?  Here we explore the interplay among three canonical forms of collective organizationmarkets, networks, and hierarchiesin aggregating decentralized problem solving.  We examine these constructs in the context of how the offices of members of Congress individually and collectively wrestle with the Internet, and, in particular, their use of official websites.  Each office is simultaneously making decisions about how to utilize their website.  These decisions are only partially independent, where offices are looking at each other for lessons, following the same directives from above about what to do with the websites, and confront the same array of potential vendors to produce their website.  Here we present the initial results from interviews with 99 Congressional offices and related survey of 100 offices about their decisions regarding how to use official Member websites.  Strikingly, we find that there are relatively few efforts by offices to evaluate what constituents want or like on their websites.  Further, we find that diffusion occurs at the tip of the iceberg:  offices often look at each others websites (which are publicly visible), but rarely talk to each other about their experiences or how they manage what is on their websites (which are not publicly visible).  We also find that there are important market drivers of what is on websites, with the emergence of a small industry of companies seeking to serve the 440 Members.  Hierarchical influencesthrough the House and through the party conferencesalso constrain and subsidize certain practices."
0,"In the context of the minority vulnerability thesis, this study assesses whether there are racial differences in the prevalence, determinants, and timing of downward mobility from managerial/executive and professional/technical occupational categories during the critical early career years. Findings from a panel study of income dynamics sample of men support theory: African Americans, compared to Whites, have a greater incidence of downward movement, face a route to downward movement that is less strongly predicted by traditional stratification-based causal factors, and experience mobility quickly. Analyses also reveal that racial gaps in downward mobility along lines enunciated by theory are greater in the private sector than the public sector. Implications of the findings for understanding evolving patterns of racial inequality in privileged occupations are discussed. "
0,"This paper proposes a disequilibrium model of identity change to explain how professional women make career decisions in the face of work-family role conflict.  Data collected from interviews of 43 women alumni of an elite business school show how identity change processes can transform career goals and attitudes.  Highly career-oriented women frequently make significant modifications to career roles in order to cope with disturbances to identities.  Major career transitions resulting from such role changes are often the emergent outcome of short-term decisions taken with little foresight in response to cumulative role strains.  Modifications to professional roles are accompanied by changes to professional and related identities, which are reconstructed through meaning-making processes.  Reconstructed identities are associated with new cognitive frameworks that define revised priorities and goals.  Disinvestment from careers can be seen as the response to role strain and identity conflict rather than the result of strategic decision-making, and differences in career commitment and attitudes understood as the result of, rather than the driver of, career decisions."
0,"Social capital theory suggests that individuals can access resources through their relationships with others. While research in this area typically focuses on the potential benefits of having high-status network alters, the authors emphasize that relationships with experts, in particular, provide access to specialized knowledge. Expertise may be accessed through formal, contractual means. But individuals who have an expert within their network of close family and friends may benefit from more convenient and lower cost expertise. The authors explore the prevalence and nature of expert contacts within individuals' social networks using data from the 1985 and 2004 General Social Surveys. About a quarter of Americans identify an expert among their network contacts. Racial minorities and members of the lower- and working-classes have less access to experts within their personal networks, however, and minorities have become particularly disadvantaged over the past two decades in terms of both overall and informal access to expertise. The authors urge further research to examine the causes of disparities in social network ties to experts and their implications for processes of social stratification."
0,"Many authors suggest that having children leads to gaps between the number of hours people prefer to work and the hours they actually work. Existing research, however, offers mixed support for that claim. We discuss the roots of this popular but poorly supported hypothesis and offer the first review of research on the topic, paying special attention to the theoretical implications of previous findings. We also offer the first evaluation of the hypothesis using U.S. panel data. We find that one particular change, the transition from no children to one child, heightens the desire for fewer hours among men and women. Most arrivals and departures of children, however, are not closely connected to hour mismatches. In part, this is because some workers (particularly women) manage to change their actual hours to match their preferences, but it is also because children have modest effects on preferred hours (especially among men). In sum, having children brings many challenges, but our analysis indicates that children bear little responsibility for the work hour mismatches so many Americans report."
0,"This article investigates the association between past lynchings (1882 to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation between past levels of lynching and current social control practices against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930. Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks, and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control, and theories that emphasize minority group threat."
0,"Nativity differences in youths' health in the United States are striking the children of foreign-born parents often have healthier outcomes than those of native-born parents. However, very little is known about how immigrant-native differences evolve within the same individuals over time, or about life cycle aspects of the health-related integration of youth with migration backgrounds. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I examine nativity differences in trajectories of weight gain during adolescence and early adulthood, as well as the degree to which temporal patterns are stratified by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. I examine whether nativity differences converge, diverge or remain stable over time, and whether patterns are socially stratified within and across nativity groups. I find that first-generation adolescents begin at a lower weight than their third generation peers and gain weight at a significantly slower pace, resulting in meaningful differences by early adulthood. More complex examination of the relationship between nativity and weight gain reveals additional differences by ethnicity: the foreign-born advantage over time does not extend as strongly to Hispanic adolescents. The findings demonstrate how the health-related integration of foreign-born youth is tied to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic circumstances, and suggest the need to examine the ways in which social circumstances and health change together.

0,"The goal is to investigate whether Latino immigrant’s English proficiency will influence their socioeconomic status and migration destinations. Latino immigrants are the fastest growing minority group in the US.  By 2003, Latinos constituted approximately 14 percent of the US population, and are projected to reach 30 percent by 2050 (2000 Census).  Through an analysis of US Census data (1990-2000) on non-citizen and naturalized Latino immigrant’s population growth and trends at the county level, OLS regression and spatial techniques are used to examine two hypotheses: (1) English speaking Latino immigrants are more likely to have higher socioeconomic status, and (2) English speaking Latino immigrants are less likely to reside in counties with other Latino immigrants.  Accordingly, this paper questions whether speaking English and attaining higher education enables an increase in Latino immigrants’ social status.  Other characteristics, such as family income, per capita and employment status, face examination.  Finally, limitations and further implications are addressed."
0,"The history of immigrant scapegoating for economic troubles in the United States led to the criminalization of undocumented entry in the 20th century and increasingly punitive collateral civil penalties for immigrant crime in its last decade. As a result of the retroactive re-criminalization of immigrants convicted of crimes who have served time, a massive deportation of resident aliens is underway without recourse to due process of law. Re-criminalization was accomplished in a series of legislative acts connected to the War on Drugs and the War on Crime and is being deployed in the 21st century War on Terrorism. Although illegal immigrants have been criminalized, the stereotype of the criminal alien is an emergent social re-construction being developed through deceptive government statistics which may become political fodder for conservative politicians who will come to advance concerns in the media about federal, state and local costs of incarcerating and deporting criminal aliens. Office of Immigration statistical enumerations of criminal aliens and costs are examined to shed light on whether they describe current levels of resident alien crime or may contain cases of retroactive deportation which inflate the numbers. Changes in enumerative practice are suggested and a concern for social justice for nonresident aliens is advocated."
0,"This research uses panel data (1989-2003) to examine the relationship between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and exports for 169 countries. Fixed effects regression results indicated that within country worldwide exports and United States exports are positively related to per capita Carbon dioxide emissions. However, when both exports to the World and to the U.S. are examined simultaneously, only exports to the U.S. are related to carbon dioxide emissions. Additional analysis Suggests that not all exports to the U.S. are responsible for the carbon-exports relationship. Specifically, the association between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and exports to the U.S. is largely the result of the oil and gas, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and re-import industries. The data suggest consumption practices in the U.S. are partially responsible for elevated per capita carbon dioxide emissions in other nations, and that carbon dioxide trends in other nations are in part driven by U.S. demands for goods. These results also indicate that inefficient production methods among countries that export products to the United States may signal a problematic trend in global carbon dioxide emissions. "
0,"Beginning in 1938, some American business groups campaigned to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment and limit the federal taxation of income and wealth. Although their proposed upward-redistributive policy would benefit few voters, it won the support of 31 state legislatures. To explain this outcome, this article offers a theory of strategic policy crafting by advocacy groups. Such groups may succeed even in otherwise unfavorable institutional environments if they craft their proposals to fit the salient policy context. Archival evidence and event history analysis support this hypothesis. Public opinion also helps explain legislative support for upward-redistributive policy."
0,"Attempts to specify the relationships between structurally produced power and status, and to explain their combined effects are relatively underdeveloped in structural social psychology. Although concepts of power and status are quite central to sociological considerations, in group processes research, they have been studied separately, under different research programs bound by scope conditions with little or no overlap. In this paper, a new approach to investigating the joint effects of power and status structures as well as a standard experimental setting for testing theoretical predictions are outlined. The central question for the proposed theory is how two independently formed structures, i.e., power and status structures, interact and affect each other within the task situation. More specifically, the objective is to predict what will be the resource distribution within groups where power and status either coincide or vary in opposite directions for related actors, how different the resource allocation process will be from the one in which only one of the investigated structures is operating, and to explain why these differences occur."
0,"Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the United States and their presence is likely to continue to expand. Little is known, however, about the correlates of Hispanic identity or the processes that are involved in its maintenance. We investigate these issues by ascertaining and then seeking to understand the various associations between reported racial identities and Hispanic ethnicity using data from the Current Population Surveys. Restricting the sample to individuals who are known to have demographic origins in Latin America, our results indicate that persons with African or Asian racial identifications are substantially less likely than whites or Others to also identify as Hispanic. Relative to the first generation, Hispanic identification declines and the racial differences increase in the second generation. The exceptions in this regard are Others for whom racial and Hispanic identifications are the most highly associated for both the first and second generations. These findings are interpreted as reflecting various social processes that are involved in the development and maintenance of racial and ethnic identities. Our results provide insight into the complex, social nature of Hispanic identification in modern America."
0,"The disparity between the image of the U.S. Peace Corps as an agency of pioneering, wholesome American do-gooders and its international reception by foreign communities and international leaders as a weapon of American imperialism could not be more contrasting. However convincing, previous claims that the Peace Corps was imperialist have lacked empirical testing and the question of Peace Corps imperialism has remained unexamined and fundamentally unanswered. Synthesizing imperialist theories, I develop a typology of cultural imperialism themes used in conjunction with frame analysis and content analysis to identify instances of cultural imperialism in a stratified sampled of 35 Peace Corps secondary data sources sampled between 1960 and 1970. I find that 60 percent of Peace Corps documents examined contained themes of imperialism as identified by major imperialism theorists. Results suggest that framing was used in Peace Corps documents to position the agency as integral to American communal self-definition, as a weapon in Americas war on Communism and to conceal imperialist messages and values from a scrutinizing public. The results suggest that claims of Peace Corps imperialism made during the agencys formative years cannot be readily dismissed."
0,"A contemporary trend in Internet interaction has recently gained media and academic attention: mourning. Simply put, grief has gone online. The introduction of this tradition into social networking websites presents familiar questions: Does the Internet just provide another medium to express the same grief in modified traditions, or does it dramatically influence the structures of social interaction and the understanding of death and mortality? More precisely, how has the proliferation of social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace influenced traditions of mourning and the symbolic interactions between the living and the dead? By beginning to examine rituals of death in the age of the machine, we learn that within the very machine that strictures it, the self strives to bridge past and present visions of death and mourning through a symbolic context that stresses an indispensable public interplay between the living and the dead. As such, spontaneous online memorials allow individuals the opportunity to transcend traditionally understood communal limitations of life and death, entering into a pact of the eternally social. It is the aim of this paper to provide a preliminary descriptive and theoretical glimpse into how these changes might impact the self and social interaction within a familiar tradition of grieving for the dead."
0,"As a step toward understanding contemporary change in Western polities and the implications of multiculturalism, we draw on the literature in sociological theory concerning group-formation, collective action and the state regulation of religion to propose tentative answers to several questions:  What are the social and economic conditions favorable to Islamist mobilization?  What factors influence the organization and coherence of Muslim interest groups? What are the institutional factors that tend to promote amiable mosque-state relations and political integration?  Although systematic evidence on Muslims in Western democracies is difficult to assemble, we will provide qualitative evidence and basic descriptive statistics on several European societies and the U.S. to explore the validity of our explanatory propositions."
0,"Nearly half of urban Russian households grow food at garden plots known as dachas. This study investigates the meaning of this activity for both those who embrace it and those who reject it. Existing scholarship frames the post-Soviet dacha as a survival strategy and debates its efficiency. Ethnographic evidence reveals that the dacha provides not simply a source of food, but a discursive arena for debating the rationality and morality of transition to a market economy. Due to their rich history, dachas may be interpreted as a site of production or of consumption, as an economic utility or a status object.  This property makes dachas particularly salient to cultural struggles over the proper relationship between economic power and social esteem in the shifting stratification order."
0,"Sociologists have made little use of recent conceptual and empirical scholarship on values (Hitlin and Pilavin 2004). In this paper, I apply Schwartz's (1992, 1994) typology of values to the rhetoric used in public debates about the acceptability of an institutional practice. I present the preliminary findings of my study of the cultural values that actors use to argue for and against Native American mascots in letters to the editor published in newspapers. I describe how actors, with diametrically opposed ideas about what is happening and what should be done, employ similar values to construct their arguments. Each side employs values of universalism, self-direction, tradition/conformity, and achievement. Likewise, I show how actors go about employing cultural values in their accounts. Key words: values, accounts, Indian mascots."
0,"Social influence is an important concept in social psychology with implications for every social science.  The field of sociology is awash in studies of the results and implications of social influence and diffusion of norms.  Understanding how beliefs and norms change and spread on a societal level has important consequences for many different facets of sociology.  In this paper, I confine the empirical investigation to a survey of political participation from 1972 to 2004, however I hope that the many possible other applications are obvious.  Instead of treating participation in each behavior as a norm in and of itself, this work looks at the relationships between each behavior and tests whether these can be considered “norms” in the traditional social psychological sense.  The space of these norms is then described, and the dynamics of these norms over the 32 year time span is measured."
0,"I develop and test a model that links neighborhood disadvantage to anger through perceptions of disorder and fear of victimization. Individuals in disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to perceive their environment to be disordered and threatening. This perception can lead to a fear of victimization. Fear of victimization is distressing and can lead to feelings of frustration and anger, especially if individuals have a low sense of control and feel powerless to deal with the situation. Anger can therefore be a result of living in a threatening environment. Data are from Ross and Britt's 1995 Community, Crime, and Health Survey, a probability sample of 2,482 adults in Illinois with linked information to respondents' census tract. Results provide general support for my model and show that: (1) neighborhood disadvantage is positively associated with anger, but this relationship is mediated by individual sociodemographic characteristics. (2) Perceived disorder is positively associated with anger as is fear of victimization, which partially mediates the effect of perceived disorder. (3) The relationship between fear of victimization and anger is conditional on a sense of powerlessness: fear of victimization is positively associated with anger when sense of powerlessness is high, but when it is low the association is negative. This study also discusses the reciprocal relationship between psychological distress and anger: anger can lead to distress and distress can also lead to anger. This idea is important since results indicate that fear of victimization leads to anger not only directly but also indirectly through psychological distress."
0,"Within the context of a theory of perceived group interest this study examines the additiive and interactive effects of minority status and social class in explaining relatively privileged AFrican Americans', Latinos', and Asians' support for income-targeted and race/ethnic targeted redistributive policies. Findings from a sample utilizing th 1994 Multi city Study of Urban INequality and the 200 National Election Study suggesy that across both types of policies perceived allegiances to both fellow racial/ethnic group members and the middle class account for the predomiance of joint minority/social class effects and levels of policy support that are intermediate between co-racial/ethnic group working class and the White middle class. The implications of the findings for further research in the area of investigation are discussed"
0,"This paper contributes to a better definition of social capital by illustrating boundaries to the concept, suggesting some situations that should lie outside a definition of social capital.  This paper makes a distinction between the political approach (based on generalized trust or voluntary associations) and the economic approach (based on instrumental use of network resources) to social capital. After a theoretical discussion of these two approaches, examples are drawn from ethnographic fieldwork in Russia to illustrate a few instances when what is commonly referred to as social capital should not in fact represent social capital."

0,"This paper proposes a model of selective mobility of workers from the state sector to the market sector to illustrate how the market transition has led to earnings inequality in former state socialist countries. Analysis of the survey data collected in 2000 from 10 Chinese cities reveals that recent entrants into the market are driven by two different institutional processes some are self-selected for higher economic returns (voluntary entrants) and some are pushed into the market through layoffs (involuntary entrants), resulting in a more heterogeneous body of workers in the market sector than before. Linear regression results show that the commonly observed higher earnings in the market sector are limited only to a subgroup of later entrants who enter the sector voluntarily. Propensity-score matching analyses further demonstrate that the effect of a late market entry on earnings is negatively associated with the propensity of making such a transition. Those who would otherwise do well in the state sector and therefore have a lower propensity for entering the market benefit more from the entry. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
0,"'Among Ourselves' is about the informal organization of Black women around a common understanding of multiple oppressions.  Throughout history, Black women have used this informal space to negotiate shared rituals of bonding to discuss our feelings in order to become uplifted and stregthen one another.  Furthermore, Black women's shared standpoints center around our lack of privilege in White Male dominate society, our objectified status as ""other"" which are compounded as consequences of race and gender oppression.  I argue in this paper that the social structural position of Black women in U.S. society makes our activism more beneficial within the context of a multicultural female experience which speaks to this groups' everyday lived experience."
0,"As the recent economic crisis has demonstrated, inequality often spans credit and labor markets, supporting a system of cumulative disadvantage. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this research draws on stigma, cumulative disadvantage and status characteristics theories to examine whether credit and labor markets intersect through the event of bankruptcy to disadvantage certain individuals over time. The transmission of bankruptcy's stigma across markets occurs in a specific legal setting where, even though the current U.S. Bankruptcy Code grants bankrupters a fresh start through debt forgiveness, the Fair Credit Reporting Act limits bankrupters' ability to begin anew because it permits employers to access credit reports. My findings highlight these ambiguities and show that, net of their previous labor market statuses, bankrupters spend less time working and have lower earnings than nonbankrupters. Thus, having become bankrupt exposes people to subsequent disadvantage in the labor market."
0,"This article explores residential patterns across generations of new immigrant groups. The discussion is situated in a multi-ethnic context. The analysis is based on data from the 2001 Canadian census and focuses on three visible minority groups in the four largest metropolitan areas of Canada. In line with the spatial assimilation perspective, the authors found that visible minority groups reside in neighborhoods where, over generations, as the proportion of whites increases, the proportions of their own group and other minority groups decline. The findings also show support that socioeconomic resources are positively related to residential integration and that each successive generation is more efficient than the previous generation in translating socioeconomic resources. However, echoing the place stratification perspective, variations in the effect of socioeconomic resources within each group and generation have been documented. Taken together, the results suggest that the factors contributing to residential integration are more complicated in a multi-ethnic context."
0,"Pooling National Health Interview Survey 1972-1996 data, this study examines whether the threshold of health is rising, such that individuals are more likely to report poor health based on weaker symptoms. The results suggest that those with some form of disability report poor health more often today than they did in the past. Yet the results also reveal a pattern more complex than a simple rising-threshold story. For one, the results suggest a non-linear trend: the conditional reporting of poor health grew steadily until 1983, as expected, but declined thereafter. The results also point to mechanisms not regularly considered in the current debate. Much of the increase, such as it is, has been due to trends in educational attainment, rather than changes in the organization or practice of medicine. Meanwhile, the post-1983 deceleration and reversal has been due, in large part, to population aging. Implications are discussed with respect to the centrality of education in shaping the meaning of and demand for health, as well as the double-edged nature of contemporary medicalization."
0,"Commentators have suggested that a ""qualitative turn"" occurred in the social sciences in the last couple of decades of the twentieth century.  We examine evidence on publication patterns and find that such a ""turn"" may have been more fiction than fact, at least as far as publication in mainstream sociology journals is concerned.  An examination of the record on the proliferation of new forms of ethnographic work suggests that the ""qualitative turn"" may have institutionalized a set of labels rather than a set of practices."

0,"The Baroque and Recorder Ensembles at the University of Pennsylvania are music department sponsored performance groups.  Recorders are woodwind instruments shaped like rods that are held upright. Holes in the instruments are closed or opened to produce different pitches and the four voices of recorders are soprano, alto, tenor, and bass.  Performing in the Recorder Ensemble allows the musicians to legitimize specific musical interests.  The ability to play music becomes a form of cultural capital used to form symbolic boundaries against non-musicians.  The players interests in early music are defined and they like to identify how early music is different from Classical or Modern music.  Their interests in performing early music coincide with other specific interests such as Paleo-biology or Middle High German linguistics.  The search for the uncommon seems like efforts to be exclusionary.   The rehearsals become the only setting for most of the musicians to discuss aspects of recorder playing.  Within the rehearsal space, members gesture while playing, speak about instruments and techniques, and comment on the challenges of the music to share expertise.  Although playing well could be the most effective way of displaying expertise, efforts are made verbally to save face."
0,"The United States has low levels of mobility relative to other industrialized nations, yet the role of education in exacerbating or ameliorating intergenerational patterns of mobility remains highly contested. Despite the magnitude of empirical attention this issue has received in education and stratification literature, the role of education on social mobility remains under-theorized. To extend this body of literature, the author utilizes Weberian definitions of power and stratification, including notions of status, honor, and privilege, to highlight the role of the American educational system as a reflection and reinforcement of social control. Furthermore, the author utilizes Weber’s concept of ‘status privilege’ to modify Ralph Turner’s (1960) analysis of ideal-typical normative patterns of mobility by illustrating the sponsorship implicit in the American educational system. This application serves to highlight how the material monopoly of education can serve as a motive for the exclusiveness of an elite status group, rather than a vehicle of mobility. The limitations and assumptions implicit in this application are discussed."
0,"Like all valued resources, positive and negative emotions are unequally distributed in a society and constitute an important basis of social stratification. In this article, a general conceptual scheme and a more specific theory of emotions are employed to offer a preliminary explanation of the dynamics of emotional stratification. This theory attempts to explain which specific positive and negative emotions will be aroused and distributed across the social class system as well as among members of differentially evaluated social categories. The theory emphasizes the importance of repression and subsequent attribution processes as central to understanding the nature, intensity, and distribution of negative emotions among individuals in lower social classes and devalued social categories. By viewing emotions as not just reactions to the unequal distribution of other resources but, rather, as a valued or punishing resource in their own right, it becomes possible to better understand how micro-level dynamics occurring in face-to-face encounters are affected by, and have effects on, meso-level and macro-level social structures and their respective cultures. In particular, the distribution of emotions can help account for both the processes of legitimatization of macrostructures and, at the same time, de-legitimization of, and collective action against, macrostructures. This analysis of emotions questions much recent theorizing and commentary, often within postmodern analysis, about the authenticity of people's emotions in contemporary society. The stratification of emotions is as real as inequality in money and power, and it has significant effects on the dynamics of human societies."

Indian Americans’ prolific representation in these businesses does not signal a lack of inter-group tensions but instead their ability to get around possible tensions through a careful deployment of labor and cultural symbols. I analyze this deployment in the “front stage” of the motel (i.e. the check-in encounter and lobby) that the guest encounters. The lobby appears as an assimilated, Anglo-normative space. In accomplishing this appearance, owners accept some degree of racial, cultural, and gender subjugation relative to white employees and (for female owners also) to men. It is by working within possible conflictual relations, rather than their absence, that lets Indian American owners get along with customers. That is, entrenched hierarchies based on race, culture, and gender limit these immigrants’ equality with native-borns. Yet, owners’ success in negotiating these hierarchies signals their simultaneous integration and the broader openness of the U.S. to immigrant minorities. With that in mind, these findings bridge competing theories of immigrant adaptation in a new way."
0,"The New Family Structures Study (NFSS) is a social-science data-collection project that fielded a survey to a large, random sample of American young adults (ages 18-39) who were raised in different types of family arrangements. In this debut article of the NFSS, I compare how the young-adult children of a parent who has had a same-sex romantic relationship fare on 40 different social, emotional, and relational outcome variables when compared with six other family-of-origin types. The results reveal numerous, consistent differences, especially between the children of women who have had a lesbian relationship and those with still-married (heterosexual) biological parents. The results are typically robust in multivariate contexts as well, suggesting far greater diversity in lesbian-parent household experiences than convenience-sample studies of lesbian families have revealed. The NFSS proves to be an illuminating, versatile dataset that can assist family scholars in understanding the long reach of family structure and transitions. "
0,"Water scarcity is a serious problem in Queretaro, Mexico.  The aquifer, El Valle de Queretaro, which is their dominant water source will potentially collapse in five to twelve years as it is being depleted by 3 to 4 meters annually.  This study looks at three governorships:  Enrique Burgos Garcia from 1991 to 1997; Ignacio Loyola Vera from 1997 to 2003; and Francisco Garrido Patron from 2003 to present.  Despite each governorship reacting differently to the impending water crisis, they all share similarities as each favors their accumulation function over their legitimacy as they are trapped in a treadmill of production.  This has led to the governors ultimately engaging in potentially questionable management practices.  Unfortunately, Queretaros future looks problematic at best and must seriously address the issues of corruption, sustainability, consumption and invest in prudent administrative practices and decision-making that will protect their water sources and encourage conservation."
